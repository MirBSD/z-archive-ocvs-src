.Sh NAME
.Nm mkstr
.Nd create an error message file by massaging C source
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkstr
.Op Fl
.Ar messagefile
.Ar prefix file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm mkstr
creates files containing error messages extracted from C source,
and restructures the same C source, to utilize the created error message
file.
The intent of
.Nm mkstr
was to reduce the size of large programs and
reduce swapping (see
.Sx BUGS
section below).
.Pp
.Nm mkstr
processes each of the specified
.Ar files ,
placing a restructured version of the input in a file whose name
consists of the specified
.Ar prefix
and the original name.
A typical usage of
.Nm mkstr
is
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ mkstr pistrings xx *.c
.Ed
.Pp
This command causes all the error messages from the C source
files in the current directory to be placed in the file
.Dq pistrings
and restructured copies of the sources to be placed in
files whose names are prefixed with
.Dq \&xx .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl
Error messages are placed at the end of the specified
.Ar messagefile
for recompiling part of a large
.Nm mkstr Ns ed
program.
.El
.Pp
.Nm mkstr
finds error messages in the source by
searching for the string
.Li \&`error("'
in the input stream.
Each time it occurs, the C string starting at the
.Sq \&"
is stored
in the message file followed by a null character and a newline character.
The new source is restructured with
.Xr lseek 2
pointers into the error message file for retrieval.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char efilname = "/usr/lib/pi_strings";
int efil = -1;

error(a1, a2, a3, a4)
\&{
	char buf[256];

	if (efil < 0) {
		efil = open(efilname, 0);
		if (efil < 0) {
oops:
			perror(efilname);
			exit 1 ;
		}
	}
	if (lseek(efil, (long) a1, 0) \ read(efil, buf, 256) <= 0)
		goto oops;
	printf(buf, a2, a3, a4);
}
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr xstr 1 ,
.Xr lseek 2
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm mkstr
appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm mkstr
was intended for the limited architecture of the PDP 11 family.
Very few programs actually use it.
The pascal interpreter,
.Xr pi ,
and the editor,
.Xr ex 1 ,
are two programs that are built this way.
It is not an efficient method; the error messages
should be stored in the program text.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

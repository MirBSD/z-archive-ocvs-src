.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm leave
.Sm off
.Oo
.Op Cm \&+
.Ns Ar hhmm
.Oc
.Sm on
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm leave
waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you
have to leave.
You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
When you log off,
.Nm leave
exits just before it would have
printed the next message.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar hhmm
The time of day is in the form
.Ar hhmm
where
.Ar hh
is a time in
hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and
.Ar mm
in minutes.
In ambiguous cases, times are converted to a 12 hour clock, 
and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.
.It Cm \&+
If the time is preceded by
.Ql + ,
the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.
.El
.Pp
If no argument is given,
.Nm leave
prompts with "When do you
have to leave?".
A reply of newline causes
.Nm leave
to exit,
otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.
This form is suitable for inclusion in a
.Pa .login
or
.Pa .profile .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr calendar 1

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

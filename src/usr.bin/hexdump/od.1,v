.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
has been deprecated in favor of
.Xr hexdump 1 .
.Pp
.Xr hexdump 1 ,
if called as
.Nm od ,
provides compatibility for the options described below.
It does not provide compatibility for the
.Fl s
option (see
.Xr strings 1 )
or the
.Fl P ,
.Fl p ,
or
.Fl w
options, nor is compatibility provided for the ``label'' component
of the offset syntax.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
.Em One-byte character display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by sixteen
space-separated, three column, space-filled, characters of input data
per line.  Control characters are printed as their names instead of as
C-style escapes.
.It Fl B
Same as
.Fl o .
.It Fl b
.Em One-byte octal display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by sixteen
space-separated, three column, zero-filled, bytes of input data, in
octal, per line.  This is the default output style if no other is
selected.
.It Fl c
.Em One-byte character display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by sixteen
space-separated, three column, space-filled, characters of input data
per line.  Control characters are printed as c style escapes, or as
three octal digits, if no c escape exists for the character.
.It Fl d
.Em Two-byte decimal display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by eight
space-separated, five column, zero-filled, two-byte units
of input data, in unsigned decimal, per line.
.It Fl e
.Em Eight-byte floating point display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by two space-separated,
twenty-one column, space filled, eight byte units of input data, in
floating point, per line.
.It Fl F
Same as
.Fl e .
.It Fl f
.Em Four-byte floating point display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by four space-separated,
14 column, space filled, four byte units of input data, in floating
point, per line.
.It Fl H
.Em Four-byte hex display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by four space-separated,
eight column, zero filled, four byte units of input data, in hex,
per line.
.It Fl h
.Em Two-byte hex display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by eight space-separated,
four column, zero filled, two byte units of input data, in hex,
per line.
.It Fl I
.Em Four-byte decimal display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by four space-separated,
eleven column, space filled, four byte units of input data, in
decimal, per line.
.It Fl i
.Em Two-byte decimal display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by eight space-separated,
six column, space filled, two-byte units of input data, in decimal,
per line.
.It Fl j Ar offset
Skip
.Ar offset
bytes from the beginning of the input.
By default,
.Ar offset
is interpreted as a decimal number.
With a leading
.Cm 0x
or
.Cm 0X ,
.Ar offset
is interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
otherwise, with a leading
.Cm 0 ,
.Ar offset
is interpreted as an octal number.
Appending the character
.Cm b ,
.Cm k ,
or
.Cm m
to
.Ar offset
causes it to be interpreted as a multiple of
.Li 512 ,
.Li 1024 ,
or
.Li 1048576 ,
respectively.
.It Fl L
Same as
.Fl I .
.It Fl l
Same as
.Fl I .
.It Fl N Ar length
Interpret only
.Ar length
bytes of input.
.It Fl O
.Em Four-byte octal display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by four
space-separated, eleven column, zero-filled, four-byte units
of input data, in octal, per line.
.It Fl o
.Em Two-byte octal display .
Display the input offset in octal, followed by eight
space-separated, six column, zero-filled, two-byte units
of input data, in octal, per line.
.It Fl t Ar type_string
Specify one or more output types.  The
.Em type_string
option-argument must be a string specifying the types to be used when
writing the input data.  The string must consist of the type
specification characters:
.Pp
.Cm a
selects US-ASCII output, with control characters replaced with their
names instead of as c escape sequences.  See also the
.Cm _u
conversion provided by hexdump(1).
.Pp
.Cm c
selects a standard character based conversion.  See also the
.Cm _c
conversion provided by hexdump(1).
.Pp
.Cm f
selects the floating point output format.  This type character can be
optionally followed by the characters
.Cm 4
or
.Cm F
to specify four byte floating point output, or
.Cm 8
or
.Cm L
to specify eight byte floating point output.  The default output
format is eight byte floats.  See also the
.Cm e
conversion provided by hexdump(1).
.Pp
.Cm d ,
.Cm o ,
.Cm u ,
or
.Cm x
select decimal, octal, unsigned decimal, or hex output respectively.
These types can optionally be followed by
.Cm C
to specify
.Em char Ns -sized
output,
.Cm S
to specify
.Em short Ns -sized
output,
.Cm I
to specify
.Em int Ns -sized
output,
.Cm L
to specify
.Em long Ns -sized
output,
.Cm 1
to specify one-byte output,
.Cm 2
to specify two-byte output,
.Cm 4
to specify four-byte output, or
.Cm 8
to specify eight-byte output.  The default output format is in
four-byte quantities.  See also the
.Cm d ,
.Cm o ,
.Cm u ,
and
.Cm x
conversions provided by hexdump(1).
.\"(a|c|f[FLD]?|[doux][C1S2I4L8]?)*
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
option causes
.Nm
to display all input data.
Without the
.Fl v
option, any number of groups of output lines, which would be
identical to the immediately preceding group of output lines (except
for the input offsets), are replaced with a line comprised of a
single asterisk.
.It Fl X
Same as
.Fl H .
.It Fl x
Same as
.Fl h .
.El
.Pp
For each input file,
.Nm
sequentially copies the input to standard output, transforming the
data according to the options given.  If no options are specified, the
default display is equivalent to specifying the
.Fl o
option.
.Pp
.Nm
exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hexdump 1 ,
.Xr strings 1
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appears in
.At v1 .
.Pp
This man page was written in February 2001 by Andrew Brown, shortly
after he augmented the deprecated od syntax to include things he felt
had been missing for a long time.

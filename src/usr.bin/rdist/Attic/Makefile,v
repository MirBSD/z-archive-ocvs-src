@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

@* use OBJECT_FMT (NetBSDish) rather than ELF_TOOLCHAIN, because
  the latter is a boolean, and we're probably going to support
  another format in addition to ELF, which is not a.out
* spacing, indenting
* fixes
* sync list of libraries with reality

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

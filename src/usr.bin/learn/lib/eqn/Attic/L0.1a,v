@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

WARNING: This course was written for UNIX in 1979, not 1999,
and has not yet been updated. Some details may be way out of date!
This course in particular may not work well on modern terminals/xterms!

This script is designed to teach you the "eqn" language
for typing mathematics. 
There are two versions of the program. "eqn" is for
use on the phototypesetter; "neqn" is for use on a
terminal like a DASI or GSI, or a Model 37 teletype.
The lessons are mostly written under the assumption
that you will be using neqn on a DASI or GSI or teletype;
a few things that are specific to eqn on the typesetter are
left to the end.

The terminal MUST be a DASI or GSI or teletype,
or you will get some rather startling results
from this script.

To verify that everything is working, this message
should come out with subscripts, superscripts, Greek
letters and so on.  If it doesn't, we're in
trouble.
.sp
Summation sign: $ sum $
.sp
Letter pi: $ pi $
.sp
Subscript and superscript: $ x sub i ~=~ y sup j $
.sp
If this looks ok, type yes.  Otherwise, type no.

Do you have the right kind of terminal?
If you are using a DASI or GSI, make
sure the switch labeled "PLOT" inside the cover
is set to ON.
If these fail, call for help;
otherwise type yes the next time.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

@#print
One thing you must be careful of is that the substitute
command does not know about word boundaries.  It will
change the first occurrence of a letter string it matches
without regard to blanks or punctuation around it.  Thus,
if the current line is
   i would rather be the king
and you type
   s/the/a/p
you get
   i would raar be the king
instead of
   i would rather be a king
Right?  You should always print lines after changing them
to avoid missing such errors.  You can defend against them
by increasing the amount of context you specify; in this
case, for example, you could say
   s/the /a /p
and get
   i would rather be a king
Often the "$" operator is useful here, if you want to
change the last thing on the line.  In the file 'text',
the third line reads
  never, never, never, never, never
Edit this file to make the third line read
  never, never, never, never, or hardly ever
Rewrite the file and type "ready".

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

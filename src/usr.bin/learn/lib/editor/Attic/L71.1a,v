@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

@#print
After the global command has selected the lines
to which the second command is to be applied, it sets '.' (the
current line) to each of these lines in turn as it executes
the controlled command.  Thus you can reference the line
before or after the selected line.  For example,
  g/xx/.-1s/ab/cd/
changes 'ab' to 'cd' on the line BEFORE each line with xx.
And
  g/xx/$t.+1
inserts a copy of the last line in the file two lines
after each line with 'xx' on it.
In this directory, the file 'memo' has paragraphs indicated
by lines beginning ".PP".  Add two blanks to the beginning of
the line after each ".PP", and then delete the ".PP" lines.
This should take only two commands.  Rewrite the file and then
type "ready".

The Ascent of the Riffelberg
by Mark Twain

  I sat silent some time, then turned to Harris and said:
``My mind is made up.''
Something in my tone struck him; and when he glanced
at my eye and read what was written there, his face paled
perceptibly.  He hesitated a moment, then said:
``Speak.''
  I answered, with perfect calmness:
``I WILL ASCEND THE RIFFELBERG.''
  If I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from
his chair more suddenly.  If I had been his father he
could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my
purpose.  But I turned a deaf ear to all he said.  When he
perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination,
he ceased to urge, and for a while the deep silence was broken only
by his sobs.  I sat in marble resolution, with my
eyes fixed upon vacancy, for in spirit I was already
wrestling with the perils of the mountains, and my friend sat
gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears.  At
last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and
exclaimed in broken tones:
``Your Harris will never desert you.  We will die together!''
  I cheered the noble fellow with praises, and soon his fears
were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure.  He
wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in
the morning, as he supposed the custom was; but I explained that nobody
was looking at that hour; and that the start in the dark
was not usually made from the village but
from the first night's resting-place on the mountainside.  I
said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 p.m. on the morrow;
meantime he could notify the guides, and also let the public
know of the attempt which we proposed to make.
  I went to bed, but not to sleep.  No man can sleep when
he is about to undertake one of these Alpine exploits.  I
tossed feverishly all night long, and was glad enough when
I heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was
time to get up for dinner.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)

  up base right now, so...

So far you have always dealt with one file at a time.
Suppose you wanted to combine two files - there is nothing
we have covered so far that will do that.  But the
editor does have a command 'r' (read)

r file

which reads in the contents of "file" without throwing
away what you already have.  So that you can combine
the files "cat" and "dog" (and name the result "animal")
by saying

ed
r cat
r dog
w animal
q

In this directory are four files named
for continents.  Combine them into
one file named "world".
(Read the files in alphabetical order,
as they are listed).  You may want to list
the input files and the combined files
with "cat" to see what they look like.
When done, type "ready" as usual.
#create Ref
This is file
'africa' and will be listed first.
------
this file will
have to do

continents
-----
  File "asia"
  is indented
  two spaces.
Europe's file is only one line long.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

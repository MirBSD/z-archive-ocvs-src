@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

Suppose you wanted to combine two files?  No editor command you
have learned so far will do that. The command 'r' is just what the doctor
ordered.  It reads in a file, without throwing away the existing buffer.
So, for example,
  ed para1
  r para2
  w both
  q
will edit "para1"; then read in "para2" at the end; and then
write the combined stuff on "both".  Try that, with those names,
in this directory.  Then type "ready".

   We say that matter is anything which occupies space and has
weight.  Matter possesses inertia, which is a resistance to change
of position or motion.  It may be acted on by forces which may set
it in motion, or change its motion.  While all these statements
are descriptive of matter, they do not provide us with a completely
satisfactory definition.  Scientists, with their great knowledge
of the properties and behavior of matter, are not yet able to
define it precisely.  Nature still holds many secrets to challenge
the minds of men.
   The quantity of matter which a body possesses is known as its
mass.
   When one end of a long glass tube that is open at both ends is
placed in water, forces cause the water to rise in the tube to a
certain height.  The finer the bore of the tube, the higher the
water rises.  A tube with a hairlike bore is called a capillary
tube and the liquid rise in it is called capillarity.  How could
you show that this rise is not due to atmospheric pressure?
   Seemingly, water rises in capillary tubes because the adhesive
forces between glass and water molecules are greater than the cohesive
forces between water molecules.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

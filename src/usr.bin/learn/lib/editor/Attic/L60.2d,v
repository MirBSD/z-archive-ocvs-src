@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

This is trickier.  Read the file "text".  Look for a line saying
"insert file ... here".  Delete that line, and in its
place (after the preceding line) read in the file asked for.
Then rewrite "text" and type "ready".

   The severity of the judicial and penal system was partly
caused by the defects of the police.  Only a small proportion of
criminals were caught, and even when arrests were made, but little
evidence was collected.  The officers, so far from being scientific
were not even properly professional.  For although the constable of
each village and the watchman of each town were paid to guard peace
land property, they were yet neither specially fitted nor trained
for that employment.  In a country village the case was even worse.
For there the magistrates could only afford to hire the part-service
of a farmer-constable.
   It is a striking fact that until recently democracy never
flourished except in very small states -- for the most part in cities.
It is true that in both the Persian and the Roman empires a measure
of self-government was accorded to local communities, but only in
respect to purely local affairs; in no large state as a whole was
democratic government found to be practicable.  One essential reason
is that until recently the means of communication were too slow and
uncertain to create the necessary solidarity of interest and similarity
of information over large areas.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

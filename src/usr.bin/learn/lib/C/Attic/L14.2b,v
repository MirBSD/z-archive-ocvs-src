@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

@#print
Write a program which counts the number of five letter
words in its input (define a word as anything between
blanks, tabs or newlines).  Compile and run it, then type "ready".
Note that all that is wanted is the total number of
five letter words - nothing was said about distinct
words.  Just count the number of times exactly five
characters appear between spaces.
#once #create Ref
This is a passage of text which contains
exactly twelve words of five letters.
Words may appear at the start or at the final
part of a line.  Other words show up in
the middle.  Avoid counting seven or eight letters
but every five must be noted.
#user
a.out <Ref >xxx
grep 12 xxx >/dev/null
#succeed
/*	one way to count five letter words */
 #include <stdio.h>

main()
{
	int since, wdnum, c;

	since = 0;
	while ((c=getchar()) != EOF) {
		if (c == ' ' || c == '\t' || c == '\n') {
			if (since == 5)
				wdnum++;
			since = 0;
		}
		else
			since++;
	}
	printf("%d\n", wdnum);

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

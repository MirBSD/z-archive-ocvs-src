@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

@#print
The function getnum actually returns -1 when it
encounters end of file. (The source is in getnum.c
if you're interested.)
Write, compile and run a program that
reads numbers one per line with getnum
and, for each, prints:

small	if the number is >0 and <=100
big	if the number is >100 and <=1000
huge	if the number is >1000.

Type "ready" when you're done.
#once cp %s/getnum.o .
#once cp %s/getnum.c .
#once #create Ref
1001
1000
999
101
100

#once #create Ref1
huge
big

big
small
small
#user
a.out <Ref >test
#cmp Ref1 test
#succeed
/* One way:*/

main() {
	int n;

	while ((n = getnum()) >= 0)
		if (n > 0 && n <= 100)
			printf("small\n");
		else if (n > 100 && n <= 1000)
			printf("big\n");
		else if (n > 1000)
			printf("huge\n");
}

/* 	Notice that in principle n could be negative,
	so we need the last case to say
		else if (n > 1000)
	instead of just falling into it with a bare
		else

	Also it's a good idea to indent the else-if's
	exactly the way they are here; otherwise
	you'll lose track of what's going on.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

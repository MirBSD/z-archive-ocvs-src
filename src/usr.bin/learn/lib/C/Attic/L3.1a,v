@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

@#print
(Section 1.3)
The file Ref.c contains a copy of
a program to convert Fahrenheit to
Celsius that prints from 0 to 300
degrees in steps of 20.
Modify it to print from 300 down to 0
in steps of 50. Type ready when you're done.
#once #create Ref
 300  148.9
 250  121.1
 200   93.3
 150   65.6
 100   37.8
  50   10.0
   0  -17.8
#once #create Ref.c
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table 
	for f = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
main()
{
	int lower, upper, step;
	float fahr, celsius;

	lower = 0;	/* lower limit of temperature table */
	upper = 300;	/* upper limit */
	step = 20;	/* step size */

	fahr = lower;
	while (fahr <= upper) {
		celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
		printf("%4.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
		fahr = fahr + step;
	}
}
#user
a.out >x
#cmp Ref x
#succeed
Here's our solution:

main()	/* Fahrenheit-Celsius 300 ... 0 by 50 */
{
	int lower, upper, step;
	float fahr;

	lower = 0;	/* lower limit of temperature table */
	upper = 300;	/* upper limit */
	step = 50;	/* step size */

	for (fahr = upper; fahr >= lower; fahr = fahr - step)
		printf("%4.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0));
}

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

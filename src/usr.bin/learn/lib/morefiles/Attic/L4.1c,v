@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

There are two files called "story1" and "story2" in
this directory.  Collect the outputs of
  grep the story[12]
and
  cat story[12] >temp
  grep the <temp
on two files called "the1" and "the2".  Then
run "diff" on "the1" and "the2", and
collect the differences on a file called "difference".
Type "ready" when you have finished all of this.

   Some animals have six feet.  These animals are insects.
Insects are little animals.  Insects creep with their six feet.
Many insects have wings, too.
   Ants are insects.  Many ants live together.  They live in ant
hills.  Many ants travel together.  Ants creep on their six feet.
Ants creep fast.  They creep around on the ground.  They creep in
and out of ant hills.  They creep up and down plants.  They creep
into houses.
   Some ants have wings.  They do not have wings all the time.
They grow wings to fly away.  They fly away to find new homes.
Then they lose their wings.

   "Will there be baby robins soon?" asked Bill.  "We will see,"
said Miss Fox.  Joan said, "we have looked and looked.  I think
there will be no baby birds."  Barbara said, "It takes many days.
The eggs need to be warm all the time.  The mother bird warms them."
Bill said, "The father bird helps, too."  Joan said, "I guess I did
not think.  There may be baby birds after all."
   One day Carl called, "Come and look.  I see four baby birds in
the nest."  All the children ran to look.  "But they are not pretty,"  
Joan said.  Bill said, "Joan is right."

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

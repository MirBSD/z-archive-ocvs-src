By default, "tail" prints the last 10 lines of its input.
You can change this default amount by specifying a different
amount as an optional argument.  For example,
  tail -5 file
prints the last 5 lines of "file". 
Collect the last line of the file "Ref" in a new file
called "last".  Type "ready" when you have finished.
(By the way, there is a limit to how big the number can be,
but it's usually at least 60 or 70 lines of normal text.)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

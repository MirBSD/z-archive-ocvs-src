@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

Another useful command is "tail", which will print the last
10 lines of a file.  This is handy when you want to see how 
far something got before it stopped, or what the last thing
in a file is.  To use "tail", all you need to say is
  tail file
What is the first word on the next to last line of the file
called "Ref" in this directory.
Type "answer WORD", where WORD is the word you found.
#create Ref
   Now Abraham Lincoln was master of the White House.  But he was
President of only part of the United States.  For the Southern
States has taken down the Star-Spangled Banner and raised the flag
of the Confederacy in its stead.  Sad and silent, Lincoln gazed
through his spyglass at the Confederate flag that fluttered in the
wind on the other side of the Potomac River in Virginia.  He pondered
how to get the Southern States back into the Union.  He needed
quiet to think what to do.  But from morning till night the White
House was crowded with people seeking his help.
   About a hundred and fifty years after the pilgrims settled in
this country, a young hunter picked up his gun.  He tossed it onto
his shoulder and followed a buffalo trail across the mountains into
what is now Kentucky.
   His name was Daniel Boone.
   He found wild country.  There were no settlers, no roads.  Indians
hunted in the woods for food.  The country was beautiful and dangerous.
But here was rich, free land -- miles and miles of it.
   Many settlers, besides the Pilgrims, had come to the shores of
America.  But they had stayed on the safe land between the sea and
the mountains.
   Columbus discovered America in 1492.  Later, other explorers
visited the new land.  They told people in Europe of the forests,
furs, and fish they found.  Many Europeans decided to settle in
this wonderful land.  But some of the first settlers starved to
death during the hard winters.  Others lived to build settlements
or colonies for their mother countries.  Colonial America was
beginning.  In 1607, three ships brought men from England to what
is now Jamestown, Virginia.  They were looking for gold.
   The leader, Captain John Smith, taught the men to build houses
of stakes and branches.  They plastered the walls of the houses with
mud.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

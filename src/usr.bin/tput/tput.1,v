.Sh NAME
.Nm tput
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute
.Op Ar attribute-args
.Ar ...
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Fl S
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
The terminal name as found in the
.Xr terminfo
database; for example,
.Dq vt100
or
.Dq xterm .
If not specified,
.Nm
retrieves the
.Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.It Fl S
The
.Ar attributes
are read from stdin instead of the command line.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
outputs a string if the
.Ar attribute
is of type string or a number if it is of type integer.
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability or 1 if it
does not.
Each
.Ar attribute
should be a string defined in either
.Xr terminfo 5
or
.Xr termcap 5 .
.Pp
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type string and takes arguments (e.g., cursor movement,
the
.Xr terminfo
.Dq cup
sequence) the arguments are taken from the command line immediately
following the attribute.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr terminfo
.Dq clear
sequence).
.It init
Print the
.Xr terminfo
initialization strings for the specified terminal.
.It longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It reset
Reset the terminal (using the
.Xr terminfo
reset sequences).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width "tput cup 6 11 dch 6" -compact
.It Li "tput clear cup 5 10"
clear the screen and goto line 5 column 10
.Pp
.It Li "tput cup 6 11 dch 6"
goto line 6 column 11 and delete 6 characters
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The exit value of
.Nm
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer the exit
value is as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width Ds -compact
.It 0
The requested string was written successfully.
.It 2
Usage error.
.It 3
Unknown terminal type.
.It 4
Unknown attribute name.
.It >4
An error occurred.
.El
.Pp
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits with a value of 0 if the terminal has this attribute or
1 if it does not.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr terminfo 3 ,
.Xr terminfo 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

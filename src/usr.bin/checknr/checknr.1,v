.Dt CHECKNR 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm checknr
.Nd check nroff/troff files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm checknr
.Op Fl fs
.Op Fl a Ns Ar \&.x1.y1.x2.y2. ... \&.xn.yn
.Op Fl c Ns Ar \&.x1.x2.x3. ... \&.xn
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
checks a list of
.Xr nroff 1
or
.Xr troff 1
input files for certain kinds of errors
involving mismatched opening and closing delimiters
and unknown commands.
If no files are specified,
.Nm
checks the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Add additional pairs of macros to the list of known macros.
This must be followed by groups of six characters, each group defining
a pair of macros.
The six characters are
a period,
the first macro name,
another period,
and the second macro name.
For example, to define a pair .BS and .ES, use
.Dq Li \-a.BS.ES
.It Fl c
Define commands which would otherwise be complained about
as undefined.
.It Fl f
Request
.Nm
to ignore
.Ql \ef
font changes.
.It Fl s
Ignore
.Ql \es
size changes.
.El
.Pp
Delimiters checked are:
.Bl -enum
.It
Font changes using \efx ... \efP.
.It
Size changes using \esx ... \es0.
.It
Macros that come in open ... close forms, for example,
the .TS and .TE macros which must always come in pairs.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is intended for use on documents that are prepared with
.Nm
in mind, much the same as
.Xr lint 1 .
It expects a certain document writing style for
.Ql \ef
and
.Ql \es
commands,
in that each
.Ql \efx
must be terminated with
.Ql \efP
and
each
.Ql \esx
must be terminated with
.Ql \es0 .
While it will work to directly go into the next font or explicitly
specify the original font or point size,
and many existing documents actually do this,
such a practice will produce complaints from
.Nm checknr .
Since it is probably better to use the
.Ql \efP
and
.Ql \es0
forms anyway,
you should think of this as a contribution to your document
preparation style.
.Pp
.Nm
knows about the
.Xr ms 7
and
.Xr me 7
macro packages.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bd -ragged -compact
Complaints about unmatched delimiters.
Complaints about unrecognized commands.
Various complaints about the syntax of commands.
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr troff 1 ,
.Xr me 7 ,
.Xr ms 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to define a 1 character macro name using
.Fl a .
.Pp
Does not correctly recognize certain reasonable constructs,
such as conditionals.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

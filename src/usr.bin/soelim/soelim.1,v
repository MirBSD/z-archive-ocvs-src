.Sh NAME
.Nm soelim
.Nd eliminate occurences of \&.so from nroff input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm soelim
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the specified files or the standard input and performs the textual
inclusion implied by the
.Xr nroff 1
directives of the form:
.Pp
.Dl \&.so somefile
.Pp
The directives need to appear at the beginning of input lines.
This is useful since programs such as
.Xr tbl 1
do not normally do this; it allows the placement of individual tables
in separate files to be run as a part of a large document.
.Pp
An argument consisting of a single minus
.Pq Ql -
is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
.Pp
Inclusion can be suppressed by using
.Ql \e'
instead of
.Ql \e. ,
i.e.,
.Pp
.Dl \'so /usr/lib/tmac.s
.Pp
A sample usage of
.Nm
would be
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
soelim exum?.n \&| tbl \&| nroff \-ms \&| col \&| lpr
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr colcrt 1 ,
.Xr more 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The format of the source commands must involve no strangeness;
exactly one blank must precede and no blanks follow the file name.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

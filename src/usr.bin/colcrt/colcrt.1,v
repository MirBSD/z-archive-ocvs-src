.Sh NAME
.Nm colcrt
.Nd filter nroff output for CRT previewing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm colcrt
.Op Fl
.Op Fl \&2
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences
for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking
is destructive.
Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing
.Sq - )
are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl
Suppress all underlining.
This option is especially useful for previewing
.Em allboxed
tables from
.Xr tbl 1 .
.It Fl 2
Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the output.
Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will suppress empty
lines.
The program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however.
The
.Fl 2
option is useful for sending output to the line printer when the output
contains superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A typical use of
.Nm
would be
.Bd -literal
$ tbl exum2.n \&| nroff \-ms \&| colcrt \- \&| more
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr col 1 ,
.Xr more 1 ,
.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr troff 1 ,
.Xr ul 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the
.Ql Fl
option so that
a true underline character would show.
.Pp
Can't back up more than 102 lines.
.Pp
General overstriking is lost;
as a special case
.Ql |
overstruck with
.Ql -
or underline becomes
.Ql + .
.Pp
Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
.Pp
Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
in documents which are already double-spaced.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

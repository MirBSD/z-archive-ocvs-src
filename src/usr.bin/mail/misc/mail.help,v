A [message list] consists of integers, ranges of same, :status, /subject, or
user names separated by spaces.  If omitted, Mail uses the current message.
The pipe command doesn't accept user names or subject message list, since
that might conflict with the command string.

A <recipient list> consists of recipient addresses or aliases separated by
spaces.  Aliases are defined in .mailrc in your home directory.

<file> is a full or relative pathname, +folder, % (system inbox), %user
(specified user's syetem inbox), # (previous file), & (mbox file), or an
expression understood by ${SHELL:-/bin/sh} -c 'echo ...'.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

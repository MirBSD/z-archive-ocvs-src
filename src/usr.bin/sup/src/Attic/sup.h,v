@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

 * HISTORY
 * 13-Sep-92  Mary Thompson (mrt) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed name of DEFDIR from /usr/cs to /usr.
 *
 * 7-July-93  Nate Williams at Montana State University
 *	Modified SUP to use gzip based compression when sending files
 *	across the network to save BandWidth
 *
 * Revision 1.10  92/08/11  12:06:42  mrt
 * 	Added definition for DEBUGFPORTNUM, the debugging port number.
 * 	Changed so that last and when file names could include
 * 	the relase name if any.
 * 	[92/07/23            mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 1.9  91/04/29  14:39:03  mja
 * 	Reduce MAXCHILDREN from 8 to 3.
 * 
 * Revision 1.8  89/08/23  14:55:30  gm0w
 * 	Moved coll.dir from supservers to supfiles.
 * 	[89/08/23            gm0w]
 * 
 * 18-Mar-88  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added host=<hostfile> support to releases file.
 *
 * 27-Dec-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added crosspatch support.  Removed nameserver support.
 *
 * 27-Jun-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added TREELIST and other changes for "release" support.
 *
 * 25-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University

 *	Merged divergent CS and EE versions.
 *
 * 19-Sep-86  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added FILESUPTDEFAULT definition.
 *
 * 07-Jun-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University

 *
 * 30-May-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added numeric port numbers to use when port names are not in the
 *	host table.
 *
 * 04-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Update protocol version to 5 for name server protocol change to
 *	allow multiple repositories per collection.  Added FILESRVBUSYWAIT
 *	of 5 minutes.  Added FILELOCK file to indicate collections that
 *	should be exclusively locked when upgraded.
 *
 * 22-Sep-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

 * HISTORY
 * Revision 1.4  92/08/11  12:07:32  mrt
 * 	Added copyright.
 * 	[92/08/10            mrt]
 * 
 * 21-Dec-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed to no longer use a name server.
 *
 * 26-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed getnams and added several new routines to change the
 *	way that sup finds nameservers.  It now builds a tree of
 *	servers to check.  It walks over the tree.  At each node, it
 *	tries to contact the name server and get as many names
 *	resolved as it can.  It stops after either all collections
 *	have host names, or if some collections don't have host names
 *	but either everyone doesn't know what they are, or after too
 *	many tries, none could be reached.
 *
 * 25-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Split off from sup.c

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

 * HISTORY
 * 02-Feb-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added check to allow multiple or recursive inclusion of this
 *	file.  Added bool enum from machine/types.h for regular users
 *	that want a real boolean type.
 *
 * 29-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Also change spacing of MAX and MIN to coincide with that of
 *	sys/param.h.
 *
 * 19-Nov-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed the number of tabs between TRUE, FALSE and their
 *	respective values to match those in sys/types.h.
 *
 * 17-Dec-84  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Only define TRUE and FALSE if not defined.  Added caseE macro
 *	for using enumerated types in switch statements.
 *
 * 23-Apr-81  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added "sizeofS" and "sizeofA" macros which expand to the size
 *	of a string constant and array respectively.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

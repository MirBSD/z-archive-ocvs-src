@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)

  up base right now, so...

/*  path  --  break filename into directory and file
 *
 *  path (filename,direc,file,filen);
 *  char *filename,*direc,*file;
 *  int filen;
 *  filename is input; direc and file are output (user-supplied).
 *  file will not have any trailing /; direc might.
 *  filen is the length of the file buffer.
 *  Note these rules:
 *  1.  trailing / are ignored (except as first character)

 *  HISTORY
 * 20-Nov-79  Steven Shafer (sas) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Copied verbatim from PDP-11.  Still as messy as ever.
 *	Some people have asked for a modification (I think that's a better
 *	idea than a new routine) which will change the directory name
 *	into an absolute pathname if it isn't one already.  The change
 *	involves doing a getwd() and prepending that if appropriate, with
 *	a "/" in between that and the directory part of the path.
 *	If you want to be cute, you can also resolve ".."s at that time.
 *
 * XXX - this is horrible code (millert)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed
stable enough.

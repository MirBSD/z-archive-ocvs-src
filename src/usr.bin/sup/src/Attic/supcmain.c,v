@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

 *	sup -- Software Upgrade Protocol client process
 *
 *	Usage:  sup [ flags ] [ supfile ] [ collection ... ]
 *
 *	The only required argument to sup is the name of a supfile.  It
 *	must either be given explicitly on the command line, or the -s
 *	flag must be specified.  If the -s flag is given, the system
 *	supfile will be used and a supfile command argument should not be
 *	specified.  The list of collections is optional and if specified
 *	will be the only collections upgraded.  The following flags affect
 *	all collections specified.
 *
 *	-s	"system upgrade" flag
 *			As described above.
 *
 *	-t	"upgrade time" flag
 *			When this flag is given, Sup will print the time
 *			that each collection was last upgraded, rather than
 *			performing actual upgrades.
 *
 *	-u	"utimes" flag
 *			When this flag is given sup will not attempt to
 *			restore access and modification files on the
 *			collection files from the server.
 *
 *	-R	"resource pause" flag
 *			Sup will not disable resource pausing and will not
 *			make filesystem space checks.
 *
 *	-N	"debug network" flag
 *			Sup will trace messages sent and received that
 *			implement the Sup network protocol.
 *
 *	-P	"debug ports" flag
 *	    		Sup will use a set of non-privileged network
 *			ports reserved for debugging purposes.
 *
 *	-X	"crosspatch" flag
 *	    		Sup is being run remotely with a crosspatch.
 *			Need to be carefull as we may be running as root
 *			instead of collection owner.
 *
 *	The remaining flags affect all collections unless an explicit list
 *	of collections are given with the flags.  Multiple flags may be
 *	specified together that affect the same collections.  For the sake
 *	of convenience, any flags that always affect all collections can be
 *	specified with flags that affect only some collections.  For
 *	example, "sup -sde=coll1,coll2" would perform a system upgrade,
 *	and the first two collections would allow both file deletions and
 *	command executions.  Note that this is not the same command as
 *	"sup -sde=coll1 coll2", which would perform a system upgrade of
 *	just the coll2 collection and would ignore the flags given for the
 *	coll1 collection.
 *
 *	-a	"all files" flag
 *			All files in the collection will be copied from
 *			the repository, regardless of their status on the
 *			current machine.  Because of this, it is a very
 *			expensive operation and should only be done for
 *			small collections if data corruption is suspected
 *			and been confirmed.  In most cases, the -o flag
 *			should be sufficient.
 *
 *	-b	"backup files" flag
 *			If the -b flag if given, or the "backup" supfile
 *			option is specified, the contents of regular files
 *			on the local system will be saved before they are
 *			overwritten with new data.  The data will be saved
 *			in a subdirectory called "BACKUP" in the directory
 *			containing the original version of the file, in a
 *			file with the same non-directory part of the file
 *			name.  The files to backup are specified by the
 *			list file on the repository.
 *
 *	-B	"don't backup files" flag
 *			The -B flag overrides and disables the -b flag and
 *			the "backup" supfile option.
 *
 *	-d	"delete files" flag
 *			Files that are no longer in the collection on the
 *			repository will be deleted if present on the local
 *			machine.  This may also be specified in a supfile
 *			with the "delete" option.
 *
 *	-D	"don't delete files" flag
 *			The -D flag overrides and disables the -d flag and
 *			the "delete" supfile option.
 *
 *	-e	"execute files" flag
 *			Sup will execute commands sent from the repository
 *			that should be run when a file is upgraded.  If
 *			the -e flag is omitted, Sup will print a message
 *			that specifies the command to execute.  This may
 *			also be specified in a supfile with the "execute"
 *			option.
 *
 *	-E	"don't execute files" flag
 *			The -E flag overrides and disables the -e flag and
 *			the "execute" supfile option.
 *
 *	-f	"file listing" flag
 *			A "list-only" upgrade will be performed.  Messages
 *			will be printed that indicate what would happen if
 *			an actual upgrade were done.
 *
 *	-k	"keep newer files" flag
 *			The -k flag, or "keep" supfile option, will cause
 *			Sup to check to see whether there is a newer file on
 *			the local disk before updating files.  Only files
 *			which are newer on the repository will be updated.
 *
 *	-K	"don't keep newer files" flag
 *			The -K flag overrides and disables the -k flag and
 *			the "keep" supfile option.
 *
 *	-l	"local upgrade" flag
 *			Normally, Sup will not upgrade a collection if the
 *			repository is on the same machine.  This allows
 *			users to run upgrades on all machines without
 *			having to make special checks for the repository
 *			machine.  If the -l flag is specified, collections
 *			will be upgraded even if the repository is local.
 *
 *	-m	"mail" flag
 *			Normally, Sup used standard output for messages.
 *			If the -m flag if given, Sup will send mail to the
 *			user running Sup, or a user specified with the
 *			"notify" supfile option, that contains messages
 *			printed by Sup.
 *
 *	-o	"old files" flag
 *			Sup will normally only upgrade files that have
 *			changed on the repository since the last time an
 *			upgrade was performed.  The -o flag, or the "old"
 *			supfile option, will cause Sup to check all files
 *			in the collection for changes instead of just the
 *			new ones.
 *
 *	-O	"not old files" flag
 *			The -O flag overrides and disables the -o flag and
 *			the "old" supfile option.
 *
 *	-v	"verbose" flag
 *			Normally, Sup will only print messages if there
 *			are problems.  This flag causes Sup to also print
 *			messages during normal progress showing what Sup
 *			is doing.
 *
 **********************************************************************
 * HISTORY
 *
 * 7-July-93  Nate Williams at Montana State University
 *	Modified SUP to use gzip based compression when sending files
 *	across the network to save BandWidth
 *
 * Revision 1.6  92/08/11  12:06:59  mrt
 * 	Merged in Brad's changes. Made resource pausing code conditional
 * 	on MACH, rather than CMUCS. Fixed some calls to sprintf to
 * 	return void.
 * 	[92/08/09            mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 1.5  92/02/08  19:01:18  mja
 * 	Correct oldsigsys type when ANSI C.
 * 	[92/02/08  18:59:47  mja]
 * 
 * Revision 1.4  92/02/08  18:24:01  mja
 * 	Added -k and -K switches.
 * 	[92/01/17            vdelvecc]
 * 
 * 27-Dec-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added crosspatch support (is currently ignored).
 *
 * 28-Jun-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added code for "release" support.
 *
 * 25-May-87  Doug Philips (dwp) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Split into several files.  This is the main program and
 *	command line processing and old history log. [V5.21]
 *
 * 21-May-87  Chriss Stephens (chriss) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Merged divergent CS and ECE versions. ifdeffed out the resource
 *	pausing code - only compiled in if CMUCS defined. [V5.21a]
 *
 * 20-May-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Removed support for version 3 of SUP protocol.  Added changes
 *	to make lint happy.  Added calls to new logging routines. [V5.20]
 *
 * 01-Apr-87  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added -R switch to reenable resource pausing, which is currently
 *	disabled by default.  Added code to check for free disk space
 *	available on the target filesystem so that sup shouldn't run the
 *	system out of disk space as frequently. [V5.19]
 *
 * 19-Sep-86  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed default supfile name for system collections when -t
 *	is specified to use FILESUPTDEFAULT; added missing new-line
 *	in retry message. [V5.18]
 *
 * 21-Jun-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Missed a caller to a routine which had an extra argument added
 *	to it last edit. [V5.17]
 *
 * 07-Jun-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed getcoll() so that fatal errors are checked immediately
 *	instead of after sleeping for a little while.  Changed all
 *	rm -rf commands to rmdir since the Mach folks keep deleting
 *	their root and /usr directory trees.  Reversed the order of
 *	delete commands to that directories will possibly empty so
 *	that the rmdir's work. [V5.16]
 *
 * 30-May-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed temporary file names to #n.sup format. [V5.15]
 *
 * 19-Feb-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Moved PGMVERSION to supvers.c module. [V5.14]
 *
 * 06-Feb-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added check for file type before unlink when receiving a
 *	symbolic link.  Now runs "rm -rf" if the file type is a
 *	directory. [V5.13]
 *
 * 03-Feb-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fixed small bug in signon that didn't retry connections if an
 *	error occurred on the first attempt to connect. [V5.12]
 *
 * 26-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	New command interface.  Added -bBDEO flags and "delete",
 *	"execute" and "old" supfile options.  Changed -d to work
 *	correctly without implying -o. [V5.11]
 *
 * 21-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fix incorrect check for supfile changing.  Flush output buffers
 *	before restart. [V5.10]
 *
 * 17-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Add call to requestend() after connection errors are retried to
 *	free file descriptors. [V5.9]
 *
 * 15-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fix SERIOUS merge error from previous edit.  Added notify
 *	when execute command fails. [V5.8]
 *
 * 11-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed ugconvert to clear setuid/setgid bits if it doesn't use
 *	the user and group specified by the remote system.  Changed
 *	execute code to invalidate collection if execute command returns
 *	with a non-zero exit status.  Added support for execv() of
 *	original arguments of supfile is upgraded successfully.  Changed
 *	copyfile to always use a temp file if possible. [V5.7]
 *
 * 04-Jan-86  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added support for fileserver busy messages and new nameserver
 *	protocol to support multiple repositories per collection.
 *	Added code to lock collections with lock files. [V5.6]
 *
 * 29-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Major rewrite for protocol version 4. [V4.5]
 *
 * 12-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed to check for DIFFERENT mtime (again). [V3.4]
 *
 * 08-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Replaced [ug]convert routines with ugconvert routine so that an
 *	appropriate group will be used if the default user is used.
 *	Changed switch parsing to allow multiple switches to be specified
 *	at the same time. [V3.3]
 *
 * 04-Dec-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added test to request a new copy of an old file that already
 *	exists if the mtime is different. [V3.2]
 *
 * 24-Nov-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added -l switch to enable upgrades from local repositories.
 *
 * 03-Nov-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Minor change in order -t prints so that columns line up.
 *
 * 22-Oct-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

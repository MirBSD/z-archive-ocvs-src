.Sh NAME
.Nm ipcs
.Nd report System V interprocess communication facilities status
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipcs
.Op Fl abcmopqstMQST
.Op Fl C Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program provides information on System V interprocess communication
(IPC) facilities on the system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show the maximum amount of information possible when
displaying active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
(This is shorthand for specifying the
.Fl b ,
.Fl c ,
.Fl o ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl t
options.)
.It Fl b
Show the maximum allowed sizes for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The
.Dq maximum allowed size
is the maximum number of bytes in a message on a message queue,
the size of a shared memory segment,
or the number of semaphores in a set of semaphores.
.It Fl c
Show the creator's name and group for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
.It Fl m
Display information about active shared memory segments.
.It Fl o
Show outstanding usage for active message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The
.Dq outstanding usage
is the number of messages in a message queue, or the number
of processes attached to a shared memory segment.
.It Fl p
Show the process ID information for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The
.Dq process ID information
is the last process to send a message to or receive a message from
a message queue,
the process that created a semaphore, or the last process to attach
or detach a shared memory segment.
.It Fl q
Display information about active message queues.
.It Fl s
Display information about active semaphores.
.It Fl t
Show access times for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The access times is the time
of the last control operation on an IPC object,
the last send or receive of a message,
the last attach or detach of a shared memory segment,
or the last operation on a semaphore.
.It Fl C Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
core instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl M
Display system information about shared memory.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl Q
Display system information about messages queues.
.It Fl S
Display system information about semaphores.
.It Fl T
Display system information about shared memory, message queues and semaphores.
.El
.Pp
If none of the
.Fl M ,
.Fl m ,
.Fl Q ,
.Fl q ,
.Fl S ,
or
.Fl s
options are specified, information about all active IPC facilities is
listed.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
System data structures may change while
.Nm
is running; the output of
.Nm
is not guaranteed to be consistent.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ipcrm 1
.Sh AUTHORS
Thorsten Lockert <tholo@@sigmasoft.com>
.Sh BUGS
This manual page is woefully incomplete, because it does not
at all attempt to explain the information printed by
.Nm ipcs .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

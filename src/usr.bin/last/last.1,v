.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm last
.Nd indicate last logins of users and ttys
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm last
.Op Fl csT
.Op Fl Ns Ar n
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl d Ar [[CC]YY][MMDD]hhmm[.SS]
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will either (1) list the sessions of specified
.Ar users ,
.Ar ttys ,
and
.Ar hosts ,
in reverse time order,
or (2) list the users logged in at a specified snapshot date & time
in reverse time order.
Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.
If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a crash or shutdown,
.Nm
will so indicate.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Calculates the total time displayed and prints it after the output.
.It Fl f Ar file
.Nm
reads the file
.Ar file
instead of the default,
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.It Fl Ar n
Limits the report to
.Ar n
lines.
.It Fl s
Display time values in seconds since the epoch, instead of formatted dates.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Specify the
.Ar tty .
tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, for example,
.Ic last -t 03
is
equivalent to
.Ic last -t tty03 .
.It Fl h Ar host
.Ar host
names may be names or internet numbers.
.It Fl T
Display better time information, including seconds.
.It Fl d Ar date
Specify the snapshot date & time.
All users logged in at the snapshot date & time will
be reported.
This may be used with the
.Fl f
option to derive the results from stored wtmp files.
When this argument is provided, all other options except for
.Fl f
and
.Fl n
are ignored.
The argument should be in the form
.Dq [[CC]YY][MMDD]hhmm[.SS]
where each pair of letters represents the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar CC
The first two digits of the year (the century).
.It Ar YY
The second two digits of the year.
If
.Dq YY
is specified, but
.Dq CC
is not, a value for
.Dq YY
between 69 and 99 results in a
.Dq CC
value of 19.
Otherwise, a
.Dq CC
value of 20 is used.
.It Ar MM
Month of the year, from 1 to 12.
.It Ar DD
Day of the month, from 1 to 31.
.It Ar hh
Hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
.It Ar mm
Minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
.It Ar SS
Second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Dq CC
and
.Dq YY
letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current
year.
If the
.Dq SS
letter pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.
.El
.Pp
If
multiple arguments are given, and a snapshot time is not specified, the
information which applies to any of the
arguments is printed, e.g.,
.Ic last root -t console
would list all of
.Li root Ns 's
sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal.
If no users, hostnames, or terminals are specified,
.Nm
prints a record of
all logins and logouts.
.Pp
The pseudo-user
.Dq reboot
logs in at reboots of the system; thus
.Ic last reboot
will give an indication of mean time between reboot.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
progressed.
If interrupted with a quit signal
.Nm
indicates how
far the search has progressed and then continues.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed

1.1.1.3
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

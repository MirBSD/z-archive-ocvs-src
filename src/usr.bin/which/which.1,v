.Sh NAME
.Nm which
.Nd "locate a program file (or files) in the path"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm which
.Op Fl a
.Ar name Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes a list of names and looks for the files which would be
executed had these names been given as commands.
Each argument is searched for along the user's path.
.Pp
If the
.Fl a
flag is given,
.Nm
will return a list of all matches instead of just the first match.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n -compact
.It 0
All names were successfully resolved.
.It 1
Some names were resolved but not all.
.It 2
No names were resolved.
.It \-1
A system error occurred.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A diagnostic is given if an executable file with the argument
name was not found in the path.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm which :
.Bl -tag -width PATH
.It Ev PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to find executables.
If
.Ev PATH
is not set, and the given name is not a fully qualified
or relative pathname,
.Nm
will fail.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr find 1 ,
.Xr locate 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr whereis 1 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
command formerly was a
.Xr csh 1
script and could expand aliases.
.Xr csh 1
now has a built-in
.Nm
command so this version is intended for use
with other shells like
.Xr sh 1 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

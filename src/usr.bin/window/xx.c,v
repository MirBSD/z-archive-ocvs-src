@Jumbo patch from wbx@@ to replace the
bcopy(3), bcmp(3) and bzero(3) func-
tions, having been deprecated earli-
er, by their ISO counterparts, name-
ly memmove(3) and the gcc3-optimized
memcmp(3) and memset(3) functions.

I didn't read every single line (be-
cause of the time of day), but looks
fine and builds through. I just nee-
ded to nuke three cases of whitespa-
ce at EOL. Good work wbx@@.

I've also sprinkled in a few patches
of mine addressing the issue that in
some kernel header files, bcopy() is
used as well... also there have been
quite some string cleaning fixes and
a missing header.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

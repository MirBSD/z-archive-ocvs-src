@Jumbo patch from wbx@@ to replace the
bcopy(3), bcmp(3) and bzero(3) func-
tions, having been deprecated earli-
er, by their ISO counterparts, name-
ly memmove(3) and the gcc3-optimized
memcmp(3) and memset(3) functions.

I didn't read every single line (be-
cause of the time of day), but looks
fine and builds through. I just nee-
ded to nuke three cases of whitespa-
ce at EOL. Good work wbx@@.

I've also sprinkled in a few patches
of mine addressing the issue that in
some kernel header files, bcopy() is
used as well... also there have been
quite some string cleaning fixes and
a missing header.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to

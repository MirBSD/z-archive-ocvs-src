.Nm time
.Op Fl lp
.Ar utility
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes and
times
.Ar utility .
After the
.Ar utility
finishes,
.Nm
writes the total time elapsed,
the time consumed by system overhead,
and the time used to execute
.Ar utility
to the standard error stream.
Times are reported in seconds.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
The contents of the
.Em rusage
structure are printed.
.It Fl p
The output is formatted as specified by
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.El
.Pp
.Xr csh 1
has its own and syntactically different built-in version of
.Nm time .
The utility described here
is available as
.Pa /usr/bin/time
to
.Xr csh
users.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility shall exit with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It 1\-125

.El
.Pp
Otherwise, the exit status of
.Nm

.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr getrusage 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.Sh HISTORY
A

command appeared in
.At v3 .
.Sh BUGS
The granularity of seconds on microprocessors is crude and
can result in times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by
a second.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

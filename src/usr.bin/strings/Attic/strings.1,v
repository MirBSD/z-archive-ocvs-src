@the a.out tools leave
tho it's a pity; they were BSD licenced, and e.g. ar and strings
would be pretty useful on non-object files, too...

.Sh NAME
.Nm strings
.Nd find printable strings in a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm strings
.Op Fl afo
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl m Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar radix
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the sequences of printable characters in each of the specified
files, or in the standard input, by default.
By default, a sequence must be at least four characters in length
before being displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
By default,
.Nm
only searches the text and data segments of object files.
The
.Fl a
option causes
.Nm
to search the entire object file.
.It Fl f
Each string is preceded by the name of the file
in which it was found.
.It Fl n Ar number
Specifies the minimum number of characters in a sequence to be
.Ar number ,
instead of four.
.It Fl m Ar number
Specifies the maximum number of characters in a sequence to be
.Ar number ,
instead of unlimited.
.It Fl o
Each string is preceded by its octal offset in the file.
.It Fl t Ar radix
Each string is preceded by its offset in the file.
The first character of
.Ar radix
determines the radix of the offset:
.Sq o
for octal;
.Sq d
for decimal; or
.Sq x
for hexadecimal.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is useful for identifying random binaries, among other things.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hexdump 1 ,
.Xr od 1
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historic implementations of
.Nm
only search the initialized data portion of the object file.
This was reasonable as strings were normally stored there.
Given new compiler technology which installs strings in the
text portion of the object file, the default behavior was
changed.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primitive.
In particular, machine code instructions on certain architectures
can resemble sequences of ASCII bytes, which
will fool the algorithm.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

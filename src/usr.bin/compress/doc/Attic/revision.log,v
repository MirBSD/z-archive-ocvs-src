/*
 * $Hdr: compress.c,v 4.0 85/07/30 12:50:00 joe Release $
 * $Lg:	compress.c,v $
 * Revision 4.0  85/07/30  12:50:00  joe
 * Removed ferror() calls in output routine on every output except first.
 * Prepared for release to the world.
 * 
 * Revision 3.6  85/07/04  01:22:21  joe
 * Remove much wasted storage by overlaying hash table with the tables
 * used by decompress: tab_suffix[1<<BITS], stack[8000].  Updated USERMEM
 * computations.  Fixed dump_tab() DEBUG routine.
 *
 * Revision 3.5  85/06/30  20:47:21  jaw
 * Change hash function to use exclusive-or.  Rip out hash cache.  These
 * speedups render the megamemory version defunct, for now.  Make decoder
 * stack global.  Parts of the RCS trunks 2.7, 2.6, and 2.1 no longer apply.
 *
 * Revision 3.4  85/06/27  12:00:00  ken
 * Get rid of all floating-point calculations by doing all compression ratio
 * calculations in fixed point.
 *
 * Revision 3.3  85/06/24  21:53:24  joe
 * Incorporate portability suggestion for M_XENIX.  Got rid of text on #else
 * and #endif lines.  Cleaned up #ifdefs for vax and interdata.
 *
 * Revision 3.2  85/06/06  21:53:24  jaw
 * Incorporate portability suggestions for Z8000, IBM PC/XT from mailing list.
 * Default to "quiet" output (no compression statistics).
 *
 * Revision 3.1  85/05/12  18:56:13  jaw
 * Integrate decompress() stack speedups (from early pointer mods by McKie).
 * Repair multi-file USERMEM gaffe.  Unify 'force' flags to mimic semantics
 * of SVR2 'pack'.  Streamline block-compress table clear logic.  Increase 
 * output byte count by magic number size.
 * 
 * Revision 3.0   84/11/27  11:50:00  petsd!joe
 * Set HSIZE depending on BITS.  Set BITS depending on USERMEM.  Unrolled
 * loops in clear routines.  Added "-C" flag for 2.0 compatibility.  Used
 * unsigned compares on Perkin-Elmer.  Fixed foreground check.
 *
 * Revision 2.7   84/11/16  19:35:39  ames!jaw
 * Cache common hash codes based on input statistics; this improves
 * performance for low-density raster images.  Pass on #ifdef bundle
 * from Turkowski.
 *
 * Revision 2.6   84/11/05  19:18:21  ames!jaw
 * Vary size of hash tables to reduce time for small files.
 * Tune PDP-11 hash function.
 *
 * Revision 2.5   84/10/30  20:15:14  ames!jaw
 * Junk chaining; replace with the simpler (and, on the VAX, faster)
 * double hashing, discussed within.  Make block compression standard.
 *
 * Revision 2.4   84/10/16  11:11:11  ames!jaw
 * Introduce adaptive reset for block compression, to boost the rate
 * another several percent.  (See mailing list notes.)
 *
 * Revision 2.3   84/09/22  22:00:00  petsd!joe
 * Implemented "-B" block compress.  Implemented REVERSE sorting of tab_next.
 * Bug fix for last bits.  Changed fwrite to putchar loop everywhere.
 *
 * Revision 2.2   84/09/18  14:12:21  ames!jaw
 * Fold in news changes, small machine typedef from thomas,
 * #ifdef interdata from joe.
 *
 * Revision 2.1   84/09/10  12:34:56  ames!jaw
 * Configured fast table lookup for 32-bit machines.
 * This cuts user time in half for b <= FBITS, and is useful for news batching
 * from VAX to PDP sites.  Also sped up decompress() [fwrite->putc] and
 * added signal catcher [plus beef in writeerr()] to delete effluvia.
 *
 * Revision 2.0   84/08/28  22:00:00  petsd!joe
 * Add check for foreground before prompting user.  Insert maxbits into
 * compressed file.  Force file being uncompressed to end with ".Z".
 * Added "-c" flag and "zcat".  Prepared for release.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  84/08/24  18:28:00  turtlevax!ken
 * Will only compress regular files (no directories), added a magic number
 * header (plus an undocumented -n flag to handle old files without headers),
 * added -f flag to force overwriting of possibly existing destination file,
 * otherwise the user is prompted for a response.  Will tack on a .Z to a
 * filename if it doesn't have one when decompressing.  Will only replace
 * file if it was compressed.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  84/08/16  17:28:00  turtlevax!ken
 * Removed scanargs(), getopt(), added .Z extension and unlimited number of
 * filenames to compress.  Flags may be clustered (-Ddvb12) or separated
 * (-D -d -v -b 12), or combination thereof.  Modes and other status is
 * copied with copystat().  -O bug for 4.2 seems to have disappeared with
 * 1.8.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  84/08/09  23:15:00  joe
 * Made it compatible with vax version, installed jim's fixes/enhancements
 *
 * Revision 1.6  84/08/01  22:08:00  joe
 * Sped up algorithm significantly by sorting the compress chain.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  84/07/13  13:11:00  srd
 * Added C version of vax asm routines.  Changed structure to arrays to
 * save much memory.  Do unsigned compares where possible (faster on
 * Perkin-Elmer)
 *
 * Revision 1.4  84/07/05  03:11:11  thomas
 * Clean up the code a little and lint it.  (Lint complains about all
 * the regs used in the asm, but I'm not going to "fix" this.)
 *
 * Revision 1.3  84/07/05  02:06:54  thomas
 * Minor fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  84/07/05  00:27:27  thomas
 * Add variable bit length output.
 *

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm zcmp ,
.Nm zdiff
.Nd compare compressed files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zcmp
.Op Ar options
.Ar file
.Op Ar file2
.Nm zdiff
.Op Ar options
.Ar file
.Op Ar file2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm zcmp
and
.Nm zdiff
are filters that invoke
.Xr cmp 1
or
.Xr diff 1
respectively to compare compressed files.
Such files generally have a
.Dq Z
or
.Dq gz
extension (both the
.Xr compress 1
and
.Xr gzip 1
formats are supported).
Any
.Ar options
that are specified are passed to
.Xr cmp 1
or
.Xr diff 1 .
.Pp
If only
.Ar file1
is specified, it is compared against a file with the same name, but
with the extension removed.
When both
.Ar file1
or
.Ar file2
are specified, either file may be compressed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "TMPDIR"
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory in which to place temporary files.
If unset,
.Pa /tmp
is used.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/tmp/zdiff.XXXXXXXXXX" -compact
.It Pa /tmp/zcmp.XXXXXXXXXX
Temporary file for
.Nm zcmp .
.It Pa /tmp/zdiff.XXXXXXXXXX
Temporary file for
.Nm zdiff .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cmp 1 ,
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr diff 1
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm zcmp
and
.Nm zdiff
rely solely on the file extension to determine what is, or is not,
a compressed file.
Consequently, the following are not supported as arguments:
.Bl -dash
.It
directories
.It
device special files
.It
filenames indicating the standard input ("-")

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

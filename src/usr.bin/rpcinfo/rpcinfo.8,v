.Dt RPCINFO 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpcinfo
.Nd report RPC information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl p
.Op Ar host
.Nm rpcinfo
.Op Fl n Ar portnum
.Fl u Ar host
.Ar program
.Op Ar version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Op Fl n Ar portnum
.Fl t Ar host
.Ar program
.Op Ar version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl b
.Ar program version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl d
.Ar program version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl s
.Ar program version port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes an
.Tn RPC
call to an
.Tn RPC
server and reports what it finds.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p
Probe the portmapper on
.Ar host ,
and print a list of all registered
.Tn RPC
programs.
If
.Ar host
is not specified, it defaults to the value returned by
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It Fl u
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to procedure 0 of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn UDP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Fl t
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to procedure 0 of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn TCP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Fl n
Use
.Ar portnum
as the port number for the
.Fl t
and
.Fl u
options instead of the port number given by the portmapper.
.It Fl b
Make an
.Tn RPC
broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
using
.Tn UDP
and report all hosts that respond.
.It Fl d
Delete registration for the
.Tn RPC
service of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version .
Registrations which point at ports numbered below 1024 can only be
deleted by the superuser.
.It Fl s
Create a registration for the
.Tn RPC
service of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version ,
located at port
.Ar port .
Registrations which point at ports numbered below 1024 can only be
created (or changed) by the superuser.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar program
argument can be either a name or a number.
.Pp
If a
.Ar version
is specified,
.Nm
attempts to call that version of the specified
.Ar program .
Otherwise,
.Nm
attempts to find all the registered version
numbers for the specified
.Ar program
by calling version 0 (which is presumed not
to exist; if it does exist,
.Nm
attempts to obtain this information by calling
an extremely high version
number instead) and attempts to call each registered version.
Note: the version number is required for
.Fl b
and
.Fl d
options.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To show all of the
.Tn RPC
services registered on the local machine use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -p
.Pp
To show all of the
.Tn RPC
services registered on the machine named
.Ar klaxon
use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -p klaxon
.Pp
To show all machines on the local net that are running the Yellow Pages
service use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -b ypserv 'version' | uniq
.Pp
where 'version' is the current Yellow Pages version obtained from the
results of the
.Fl p
switch above.
.Pp
To delete the registration for version 1 of the
.Nm walld
service use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -d walld 1

.Xr portmap 8
.Rs
.%T "RPC Programming Guide"
.Re
.Sh BUGS
In releases prior to SunOS 3.0, the Network File System (NFS) did not
register itself with the portmapper;
.Nm
cannot be used to make
.Tn RPC
calls to the
.Tn NFS
server on hosts running such releases.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

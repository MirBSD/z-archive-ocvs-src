.Sh NAME
.Nm locate
.Nd find filenames quickly
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm locate
.Op Fl Scims
.Op Fl l Ar limit
.Op Fl d Ar database
.Ar pattern Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility searches a database for all pathnames which match the specified
.Ar pattern .
The database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily),
and contains the pathnames
of all files which are publicly accessible.
.Pp
Shell globbing and quoting characters
.Pf ( Ql * ,
.Ql ? ,
.Ql \e ,
.Ql [ ,
and
.Ql \&] )
may be used in
.Ar pattern ,
although they will have to be escaped from the shell.
Preceding any character with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e
eliminates any special meaning which it may have.
The matching differs in that no characters must be matched explicitly,
including slashes
.Pq Ql / .
.Pp
As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters
.Pq Dq foo
is matched as though it were
.Dq *foo* .
.Pp
Historically,
.Nm
stores only characters between 32 and 127.
The current implementation stores all characters except newline
.Pq Ql \en
and
NUL
.Pq Ql \e0 .
The 8-bit character support does not waste extra space for
plain
.Tn ASCII
file names.
Characters less than 32 or greater than 127 are stored as 2 bytes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl S
Print some statistics about the database and exit.
.It Fl c
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching file names.
.It Fl d Ar database
Search in
.Ar database
instead of the default file name database.
Multiple
.Fl d
options are allowed.
Each additional
.Fl d
option adds the specified database to the list
of databases to be searched.
.Pp
.Ar database
may be a colon-separated list of databases.
A single colon is a reference to the default database.
.Pp
$ locate -d $HOME/lib/mydb: foo
.Pp
will first search for the string
.Dq foo
in
.Pa $HOME/lib/mydb
and then in
.Pa /var/db/locate.database .
.Pp
$ locate -d $HOME/lib/mydb::/cdrom/locate.database foo
.Pp
will first search for the string
.Dq foo
in
.Pa $HOME/lib/mydb
and then in
.Pa /var/db/locate.database
and then in
.Pa /cdrom/locate.database .
.Pp
$ locate -d db1 -d db2 -d db3 pattern
.Pp
is the same as
.Pp
$ locate -d db1:db2:db3 pattern
.Pp
or
.Pp
$ locate -d db1:db2 -d db3 pattern
.Pp
If
.Ql \-
is given as the
.Ar database
name, standard input will be read instead.
For example, you can compress your database
and use:
.Pp
$ zcat database.gz | locate -d - pattern
.Pp
This might be useful on machines with a fast CPU, little RAM and slow
I/O.
.Sy Note:
You can only use
.Em one
pattern for stdin.
.It Fl i
Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the database.
.It Fl l Ar number
Limit output to
.Ar number
of file names and exit.
.It Fl m
Use
.Xr mmap 2
instead of the
.Xr stdio 3
library.
This is the default behavior.
Usually faster in most cases.
.It Fl s
Use the
.Xr stdio 3
library instead of
.Xr mmap 2 .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width LOCATE_PATH -compact
.It Ev LOCATE_PATH
Path to the locate database if set and not empty; ignored if the
.Fl d
option was specified.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
may fail to list some files that are present, or may
list files that have been removed from the system.
This is because
.Nm
only reports files that are present in a periodically reconstructed
database (typically rebuilt once a week by the
.Pa /etc/weekly
script).
Use
.Xr find 1
to locate files that are of a more transitory nature.
.Pp
The
.Nm
database is built by user
.Dq nobody
using
.Xr find 1 .
This will
skip directories which are not readable by user
.Dq nobody ,
group
.Dq nobody ,
or
the world.
e.g., if your home directory is not world-readable, your files will
.Em not
appear in the database.
.Pp
The
.Nm
database is not byte order independent.
It is not possible
to share the databases between machines with different byte order.
The current
.Nm
implementation understands databases in host byte order or
network byte order.
So a little-endian machine can't understand
a locate database which was built on a big-endian machine.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs

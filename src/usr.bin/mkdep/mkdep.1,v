.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdep
.Nd construct Makefile dependency list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkdep
.Op Fl ap
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Ar flags
.Ar file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes a set of flags for the C compiler and a list
of C source files as arguments and constructs a set of include
file dependencies which are written into the file
.Pa .depend .
An example of its use in a Makefile might be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
CFLAGS= -O -I../include
SRCS= file1.c file2.c

depend:
	mkdep ${CFLAGS} ${SRCS}
.Ed
.Pp
where the macro SRCS is the list of C source files and the macro
CFLAGS is the list of flags for the C compiler.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append to the output file,
so that multiple
.Nm mkdep Ns 's
may be run from a single Makefile.
.It Fl f Ar file
Write the include file dependencies to
.Ar file ,
instead of the default
.Pa .depend .
.It Fl p
Cause
.Nm
to produce dependencies of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
program: program.c
.Ed
.Pp
so that subsequent makes will produce
.Ar program
directly from its C module rather than using an intermediate
.Pa \&.o
module.
This is useful for programs whose source is contained in a single
module.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@unbreak once again (for the cc case):
don't check for +x on ${CC:-cc}, but rather use
which(1) for resolving if "${CC:-cc}" is in the path,
and reset CC=pgcc if not (pgcc is always in the path
on MirBSD)

Suggestions, improvements?

@fix breakage in the OpenBSD version of /sys/kern/genassym.ch
by circumventing a bug in said script by means of making
our mkdep(1) more intelligent (it looks if ${CC:-cc} exists,
and if not, uses pgcc)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

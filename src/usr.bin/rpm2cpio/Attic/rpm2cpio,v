rpm2cpio, perl version by orabidoo <odar\@@pobox.com> +sw for MirOS
dumps the contents to stdout as a cpio archive

use: rpm2cpio [file.rpm] >file.cpio

Here's how to use cpio:
     list of contents:   tar tf file.cpio
        extract files:   tar xp[hv]f file.cpio
You could use "cpio -mid[v] <file.cpio" as well...

@stop trying to be clever and not open "-h" or "--help"
couldn't get it to work; as I said, perl sucks
(kind of discovered by bsiegert@@)

also, print help to stderr, as usual in Unix

# (whew, that's done!)

# why does the world need another rpm2cpio?  because the existing one
# won't build unless you have half a ton of things that aren't really
# required for it, since it uses the same library used to extract RPM's.
# in particular, it won't build on the HPsUX box i'm on.

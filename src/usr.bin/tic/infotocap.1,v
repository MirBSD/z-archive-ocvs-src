.SH NAME
\fBinfotocap\fR - convert a \fIterminfo\fR description into a \fItermcap\fR description
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBinfotocap\fR [\fB-v\fR\fIn\fR \fIwidth\fR]  [\fB-V\fR] [\fB-1\fR] [\fB-w\fR \fIwidth\fR] \fIfile\fR . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinfotocap\fR looks in \fIfile\fR for \fBterminfo\fR descriptions.  For each
one found, an equivalent \fBtermcap\fR description is written to standard
output.  Terminfo \fBuse\fR capabilities are translated directly to termcap
\fBtc\fR capabilities.
.TP 5
\fB-v\fR
print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.
.TP 5
\fB-V\fR
print out the version of the program in use on standard error and exit.
.TP 5
\fB-1\fR
cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields
will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
characters.
.TP 5
\fB-w\fR
change the output to \fIwidth\fR characters.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
\*d
Compiled terminal description database.
.SH NOTES
This utility is actually a link to \fItic\fR(1M), running in \fI-C\fR mode.
You can use other \fItic\fR options such as \fB-f\fR and  \fB-x\fR.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* fix the build system
* fix and enable the GNU Pascal RTS and Utils
  -> gpc is now fully supported; Hello World works.
* merge OpenBSD-OpenSSH 3.8, bump patchlevel
* add fchroot(2) diff, From: Pedro Martelletto <pbastos@@rdc.puc-rio.br>
* add fchroot(2) man page from NetBSD and myself
* fix orders of manpage sections
* fix displaying of .Nx mdoc macro
* convert scripts requiring bash to ksh
* nuke a shutload of GNU make idiotisms
* add pregenerated manpages - help2man is just bloat
* increase shlib versions after fchroot addition
* adjust and unbreak mk.conf after recent changes
* fix boot system version number after CD boot changes
* understand why Makefile.bsd-wrapper is needed as filename. Finally.
* regenerate files after syscalls.master change
* fix RCS Id detection and generation while here
* remove unused archs while there
* use __RCSID() macro in ssh ifdef __MirBSD__
* build ssh with -Werror, too

Note: this is a pre-snapshot, pre-build commit. Nothing
of this has actually been tested.

Like I said, please wait for the snapshot. Though, the
snapshot doesn't have any more circumstances preventing
me from working towards a release and upload now.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

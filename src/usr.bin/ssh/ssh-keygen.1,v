.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates, manages and converts authentication keys for
.Xr ssh 1 .
.Nm
can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA
keys for use by SSH protocol version 2.
The type of key to be generated is specified with the
.Fl t
option.
.Pp
.Nm
is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman group
exchange (DH-GEX).
See the
.Sx MODULI GENERATION
section for details.
.Pp
Normally each user wishing to use SSH
with RSA or DSA authentication runs this once to create the authentication
key in
.Pa $HOME/.etc/ssh/identity ,
.Pa $HOME/.etc/ssh/id_dsa
or
.Pa $HOME/.etc/ssh/id_rsa .
Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate host keys,
as seen in
.Pa /etc/rc .
.Pp
Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which
to store the private key.
The public key is stored in a file with the same name but
.Dq .pub
appended.
The program also asks for a passphrase.
The passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase
(host keys must have an empty passphrase), or it may be a string of
arbitrary length.
A passphrase is similar to a password, except it can be a phrase with a
series of words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of
characters you want.
Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are
not simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English
prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy per character, and provides very bad
passphrases), and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters,
numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
The passphrase can be changed later by using the
.Fl p
option.
.Pp
There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.
If the passphrase is
lost or forgotten, a new key must be generated and copied to the
corresponding public key to other machines.
.Pp
For RSA1 keys,
there is also a comment field in the key file that is only for
convenience to the user to help identify the key.
The comment can tell what the key is for, or whatever is useful.
The comment is initialized to
.Dq user@@host
when the key is created, but can be changed using the
.Fl c
option.
.Pp
After a key is generated, instructions below detail where the keys
should be placed to be activated.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar trials
Specifies the number of primality tests to perform when screening DH-GEX
candidates using the
.Fl T
command.
.It Fl b Ar bits
Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.
Minimum is 512 bits.
Generally, 1024 bits is considered sufficient.
The default is 1024 bits.
.It Fl c
Requests changing the comment in the private and public key files.
This operation is only supported for RSA1 keys.
The program will prompt for the file containing the private keys, for
the passphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.
.It Fl e
This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and
print the key in a
.Sq SECSH Public Key File Format
to stdout.
This option allows exporting keys for use by several commercial
SSH implementations.
.It Fl E
This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and
print the public key in a format suitable for the
.Xr openssl 1
command to stdout.
.It Fl g
Use generic DNS format when printing fingerprint resource records using the
.Fl r
command.
.It Fl f Ar filename
Specifies the filename of the key file.
.It Fl i
This option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file
in SSH2-compatible format and print an OpenSSH compatible private
(or public) key to stdout.
.Nm
also reads the
.Sq SECSH Public Key File Format .
This option allows importing keys from several commercial
SSH implementations.
.It Fl I
This option will read a public key file in the
.Xr openssl 1
tool format and print an OpenSSH compatible public key to stdout.
.It Fl l
Show fingerprint of specified public key file.
Private RSA1 keys are also supported.
For RSA and DSA keys
.Nm
tries to find the matching public key file and prints its fingerprint.
.It Fl p
Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of
creating a new private key.
The program will prompt for the file
containing the private key, for the old passphrase, and twice for the
new passphrase.
.It Fl q
Silence
.Nm ssh-keygen .
Used by
.Pa /etc/rc
when creating a new key.
.It Fl y
This option will read a private
OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.
.It Fl t Ar type
Specifies the type of the key to create.
The possible values are
.Dq rsa1
for protocol version 1 and
.Dq rsa
or
.Dq dsa
for protocol version 2.
.It Fl B
Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key file.
.It Fl C Ar comment
Provides the new comment.
.It Fl D Ar reader
Download the RSA public key stored in the smartcard in
.Ar reader .
.It Fl G Ar output_file
Generate candidate primes for DH-GEX.
These primes must be screened for
safety (using the
.Fl T
option) before use.
.It Fl M Ar memory
Specify the amount of memory to use (in megabytes) when generating
candidate moduli for DH-GEX.
.It Fl N Ar new_passphrase
Provides the new passphrase.
.It Fl P Ar passphrase
Provides the (old) passphrase.
.It Fl S Ar start
Specify start point (in hex) when generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.
.It Fl T Ar output_file
Test DH group exchange candidate primes (generated using the
.Fl G
option) for safety.
.It Fl W Ar generator
Specify desired generator when testing candidate moduli for DH-GEX.
.It Fl U Ar reader
Upload an existing RSA private key into the smartcard in
.Ar reader .
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Causes
.Nm
to print debugging messages about its progress.
This is helpful for debugging moduli generation.
Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
The maximum is 3.
.It Fl r Ar hostname
Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named
.Ar hostname
for the specified public key file.
.El
.Sh MODULI GENERATION
.Nm
may be used to generate groups for the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange
(DH-GEX) protocol.
Generating these groups is a two-step process: first, candidate
primes are generated using a fast, but memory intensive process.
These candidate primes are then tested for suitability (a CPU-intensive
process).
.Pp
Generation of primes is performed using the
.Fl G
option.
The desired length of the primes may be specified by the
.Fl b
option.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl ssh-keygen -G moduli-2048.candidates -b 2048
.Pp
By default, the search for primes begins at a random point in the
desired length range.
This may be overridden using the
.Fl S
option, which specifies a different start point (in hex).
.Pp
Once a set of candidates have been generated, they must be tested for
suitability.
This may be performed using the
.Fl T
option.
In this mode
.Nm
will read candidates from standard input (or a file specified using the
.Fl f
option).
For example:
.Pp
.Dl ssh-keygen -T moduli-2048 -f moduli-2048.candidates
.Pp
By default, each candidate will be subjected to 100 primality tests.
This may be overridden using the
.Fl a
option.
The DH generator value will be chosen automatically for the
prime under consideration.
If a specific generator is desired, it may be requested using the
.Fl W
option.
Valid generator values are 2, 3 and 5.
.Pp
Screened DH groups may be installed in
.Pa /etc/moduli .
It is important that this file contains moduli of a range of bit lengths and
that both ends of a connection share common moduli.

.Sh AUTHORS
OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free
ssh 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen.
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt and Dug Song
removed many bugs, re-added newer features and
created OpenSSH.
Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.

1.1.1.5
log
@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

.Sh MODULI GENERATION
.Nm
may be used to generate groups for the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange
(DH-GEX) protocol.
Generating these groups is a two-step process: first, candidate
primes are generated using a fast, but memory intensive process.
These candidate primes are then tested for suitability (a CPU-intensive
process).
.Pp
Generation of primes is performed using the
.Fl G
option.
The desired length of the primes may be specified by the
.Fl b
option.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl ssh-keygen -G moduli-2048.candidates -b 2048
.Pp
By default, the search for primes begins at a random point in the
desired length range.
This may be overridden using the
.Fl S
option, which specifies a different start point (in hex).
.Pp
Once a set of candidates have been generated, they must be tested for
suitability.
This may be performed using the
.Fl T
option.
In this mode
.Nm
will read candidates from standard input (or a file specified using the
.Fl f
option).
For example:
.Pp
.Dl ssh-keygen -T moduli-2048 -f moduli-2048.candidates
.Pp
By default, each candidate will be subjected to 100 primality tests.
This may be overridden using the
.Fl a
option.
The DH generator value will be chosen automatically for the
prime under consideration.
If a specific generator is desired, it may be requested using the
.Fl W
option.
Valid generator values are 2, 3 and 5.
.Pp
Screened DH groups may be installed in
.Pa /etc/moduli .
It is important that this file contains moduli of a range of bit lengths and
that both ends of a connection share common moduli.
a286 4
.It Pa /etc/moduli
Contains Diffie-Hellman groups used for DH-GEX.
The file format is described in

@Harden MirBSD:
* disallow remote root logins by default
* document that SFTP is disabled by default (since not that long ago)

Fix documentation:
* fix Cipher (sshv1), Ciphers (sshv2) and MACs in the code,
  configuration file and manual page to agree
* synchronize docs with reality

While here, the usual cleanup:
* no whitespace at end of line
* no usage of the character 0x60 in my tree!
* add/change RCS Id

Bump version number, as this is a user-visible change.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

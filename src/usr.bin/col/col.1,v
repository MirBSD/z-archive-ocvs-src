.Sh NAME
.Nm col
.Nd filter reverse line feeds from input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm col
.Op Fl bfhx
.Op Fl l Ar num
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
filters out reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so that the output is
in the correct order with only forward and half-forward line
feeds, and replaces whitespace characters with tabs where possible.
This can be useful in processing the output of
.Xr nroff 1
and
.Xr tbl 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character
written to each column position.
.It Fl f
Forward half-line feeds are permitted
.Pf ( Ns Dq fine
mode).
Normally characters printed on a half-line boundary are printed
on the following line.
.It Fl h
Compress spaces into tabs.
This is the default behavior.
.It Fl x
Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.
.It Fl l Ar num
Buffer at least
.Ar num
lines in memory.
By default, 256 lines are buffered.
.El
.Pp
The control sequences for carriage motion that
.Nm
understands and their decimal values are listed in the following
table:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "carriage return" -compact
.It ESC\-7
Reverse line feed (escape then 7).
.It ESC\-10
Half reverse line feed (escape then 10).
.It ESC\-11
Half forward line feed (escape then 11).
.It backspace
Moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column.
.It carriage return
Move back to first column (13).
.It newline
Forward line feed (10); also does carriage return.
.It shift in
Shift to normal character set (15).
.It shift out
Shift to alternate character set (14).
.It space
Moves forward one column (32).
.It tab
Moves forward to next tab stop (9).
.It vertical tab
Reverse line feed (11).
.El
.Pp
All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are
discarded.
.Pp
.Nm
keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes
sure the character set is correct when they are output.
.Pp
If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line,
.Nm
will display a warning message.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

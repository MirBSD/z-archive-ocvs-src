.Sh NAME
.Nm awk
.Nd pattern-directed scanning and processing language
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm awk
.Op Fl safe
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl d Ns Op Ar n
.Op Fl F Ar fs
.Oo Fl v Ar var Ns =
.Ns Ar value Oc
.Op Ar prog | Fl f Ar progfile
.Ar
.Nm nawk
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans each input
.Ar file
for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally in
.Ar prog
or in one or more files specified as
.Fl f Ar progfile .
With each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed
when a line of a
.Ar file
matches the pattern.
Each line is matched against the
pattern portion of every pattern-action statement;
the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.
The file name
.Sq -
means the standard input.
Any
.Ar file
of the form
.Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
is treated as an assignment, not a filename,
and is executed at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-safe "
.It Fl d Ns Op Ar n
Debug mode.
Set debug level to
.Ar n ,
or 1 if
.Ar n
is not specified.
A value greater than 1 causes
.Nm
to dump core on fatal errors.
.It Fl F Ar fs
Define the input field separator to be the regular expression
.Ar fs .
.It Fl f Ar filename
Read program code from the specified file
.Ar filename
instead of from the command line.
.It Fl safe
Disable file output
.Pf ( Ic print No > ,
.Ic print No >> ) ,
process creation
.Po
.Ar cmd | Ic getline ,
.Ic print No \&| ,
.Ic system
.Pc
and access to the environment
.Pf ( Va ENVIRON ;
see the section on variables below).
This is a first
.Pq and not very reliable
approximation to a
.Dq safe
version of
.Nm .
.It Fl V
Print the version number of
.Nm
to standard output and exit.
.It Fl v Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
Assign
.Ar value
to variable
.Ar var
before
.Ar prog
is executed;
any number of
.Fl v
options may be present.
.El
.Pp
The input is normally made up of input lines
.Pq records
separated by newlines, or by the value of
.Va RS .
If
.Va RS
is null, then any number of blank lines are used as the record separator,
and newlines are used as field separators
(in addition to the value of
.Va FS ) .
This is convenient when working with multi-line records.
.Pp
An input line is normally made up of fields separated by whitespace,
or by the regular expression
.Va FS .
The fields are denoted
.Va $1 , $2 , ... ,
while
.Va $0
refers to the entire line.
If
.Va FS
is null, the input line is split into one field per character.
.Pp
Normally, any number of blanks separate fields.
In order to set the field separator to a single blank, use the
.Fl F
option with a value of
.Sq [\ \&] .
If a field separator of
.Sq t
is specified,
.Nm
treats it as if
.Sq \et
had been specified and uses
.Aq TAB
as the field separator.
In order to use a literal
.Sq t
as the field separator, use the
.Fl F
option with a value of
.Sq [t] .
.Pp
A pattern-action statement has the form
.Pp
.D1 Ar pattern Ic \&{ Ar action Ic \&}
.Pp
A missing
.Ic \&{ Ar action Ic \&}
means print the line;
a missing pattern always matches.
Pattern-action statements are separated by newlines or semicolons.
.Pp
Newlines are permitted after a terminating statement or following a comma
.Pq Sq \&, ,
an open brace
.Pq Sq { ,
a logical AND
.Pq Sq && ,
a logical OR
.Pq Sq || ,
after the
.Sq do
or
.Sq else
keywords,
or after the closing parenthesis of an
.Sq if ,
.Sq for ,
or
.Sq while
statement.
Additionally, a backslash
.Pq Sq \e
can be used to escape a newline between tokens.
.Pp
An action is a sequence of statements.
A statement can be one of the following:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Ic if ( Xo
.Ar expression ) statement Op Ic else Ar statement
.Xc
.Ic while ( Ar expression ) statement
.Ic for ( Xo
.Ar expression ; expression ; expression ) statement
.Xc
.Ic for ( Xo
.Ar var Ic in Ar array ) statement
.Xc
.Ic do Ar statement Ic while ( Ar expression )
.Ic break
.Ic continue
.Ic { Oo Ar statement ... Oc Ic \&}
.Ar expression Xo
.No "# commonly" Ar var Ic = Ar expression
.Xc
.Ic print Xo
.Op Ar expression-list
.Op > Ns Ar expression
.Xc
.Ic printf Ar format Xo
.Op Ar ... , expression-list
.Op > Ns Ar expression
.Xc
.Ic return Op Ar expression
.Ic next Xo
.No "# skip remaining patterns on this input line"
.Xc
.Ic nextfile Xo
.No "# skip rest of this file, open next, start at top"
.Xc
.Ic delete Ar array Ns Xo
.Ic \&[ Ns Ar expression Ns Ic \&]
.No "\ # delete an array element"
.Xc
.Ic delete Ar array Xo
.No "# delete all elements of array"
.Xc
.Ic exit Xo
.Op Ar expression
.No "\ # exit immediately; status is" Ar expression
.Xc
.Ed
.Pp
Statements are terminated by
semicolons, newlines or right braces.
An empty
.Ar expression-list
stands for
.Ar $0 .
String constants are quoted
.Li \&"" ,
with the usual C escapes recognized within
(see
.Xr printf 1
for a complete list of these).
Expressions take on string or numeric values as appropriate,
and are built using the operators
.Ic + \- * / % ^
.Pq exponentiation ,
and concatenation
.Pq indicated by whitespace .
The operators
.Ic \&! ++ \-\- += \-= *= /= %= ^=
.Ic > >= < <= == != ?:
are also available in expressions.
Variables may be scalars, array elements
(denoted
.Li x[i] )
or fields.
Variables are initialized to the null string.
Array subscripts may be any string,
not necessarily numeric;
this allows for a form of associative memory.
Multiple subscripts such as
.Li [i,j,k]
are permitted; the constituents are concatenated,
separated by the value of
.Va SUBSEP
.Pq see the section on variables below ) .
.Pp
The
.Ic print
statement prints its arguments on the standard output
(or on a file if
.Pf > Ns Ar file
or
.Pf >> Ns Ar file
is present or on a pipe if
.Pf |\ \& Ar cmd
is present), separated by the current output field separator,
and terminated by the output record separator.
.Ar file
and
.Ar cmd
may be literal names or parenthesized expressions;
identical string values in different statements denote
the same open file.
The
.Ic printf
statement formats its expression list according to the format
(see
.Xr printf 3 ) .
.Pp
Patterns are arbitrary Boolean combinations
(with
.Ic "\&! || &&" )
of regular expressions and
relational expressions.
Regular expressions are as in
.Xr egrep 1 .
Isolated regular expressions
in a pattern apply to the entire line.
Regular expressions may also occur in
relational expressions, using the operators
.Ic ~
and
.Ic !~ .
.Pf / Ns Ar re Ns /
is a constant regular expression;
any string (constant or variable) may be used
as a regular expression, except in the position of an isolated regular expression
in a pattern.
.Pp
A pattern may consist of two patterns separated by a comma;
in this case, the action is performed for all lines
from an occurrence of the first pattern
through an occurrence of the second.
.Pp
A relational expression is one of the following:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Ar expression matchop regular-expression
.Ar expression relop expression
.Ar expression Ic in Ar array-name
.Ic \&( Ns Xo
.Ar expr , expr , \&... Ns Ic \&) in
.Ar \ array-name
.Xc
.Ed
.Pp
where a
.Ar relop
is any of the six relational operators in C, and a
.Ar matchop
is either
.Ic ~
(matches)
or
.Ic !~
(does not match).
A conditional is an arithmetic expression,
a relational expression,
or a Boolean combination
of these.
.Pp
The special patterns
.Ic BEGIN
and
.Ic END
may be used to capture control before the first input line is read
and after the last.
.Ic BEGIN
and
.Ic END
do not combine with other patterns.
.Pp

is replaced in string
.Fa s
with regular expression
.Fa r .
A literal ampersand can be specified by preceding it with two backslashes
.Pq Sq \e\e .
A literal backslash can be specified by preceding it with another backslash
.Pq Sq \e\e .
.Fn sub
returns the number of replacements.
.It Fn substr s m n

.Fa str
with all upper-case characters translated to their
corresponding lower-case equivalents.
.It Fn toupper str
Returns a copy of

.Fa expr .
.Fa expr
should match the string that was used to open the file or pipe.
.It Ar cmd | Ic getline Op Va var
Read a record of input from a stream piped from the output of
.Ar cmd .
If
.Va var
is omitted, the variables
.Va $0
and
.Va NF
are set.
Otherwise
.Va var

If the stream is not open, it is opened.
As long as the stream remains open, subsequent calls
will read subsequent records from the stream.
The stream remains open until explicitly closed with a call to
.Fn close .
.It Fn fflush expr
Flushes any buffered output for the file or pipe
.Fa expr .
.Fa expr
should match the string that was used to open the file or pipe.
.It Ic getline

sets the variables
.Va NF ,
.Va NR ,
and
.Va FNR .
.Ic getline
returns 1 for a successful input, 0 for end of file, and \-1 for an error.
.It Ic getline Va var
Sets
.Va $0
to variable
.Va var .
This form of
.Ic getline
sets the variables
.Va NR
and
.Va FNR .

returns 1 for a successful input, 0 for end of file, and \-1 for an error.
.It Xo
.Ic getline Op Va var
.Pf \ \&< Ar file
.Xc
Sets
.Va $0
to the next record from
.Ar file .
If
.Va var
is omitted, the variables
.Va $0
and
.Va NF
are set.
Otherwise
.Va var
is set.
If
.Ar file
is not open, it is opened.
As long as the stream remains open, subsequent calls will read subsequent
records from
.Ar file .
.Ar file
remains open until explicitly closed with a call to
.Fn close .
.It Fn system cmd
Executes
.Fa cmd
and returns its exit status.
.El
.Pp
Functions may be defined (at the position of a pattern-action statement)
thusly:
.Pp
.Dl function foo(a, b, c) { ...; return x }
.Pp
Parameters are passed by value if scalar, and by reference if array name;
functions may be called recursively.
Parameters are local to the function; all other variables are global.
Thus local variables may be created by providing excess parameters in
the function definition.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Print lines longer than 72 characters:
.Pp
.Dl length($0) > 72
.Pp
Print first two fields in opposite order:
.Pp
.Dl { print $2, $1 }
.Pp
Same, with input fields separated by comma and/or blanks and tabs:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
BEGIN { FS = ",[ \et]*|[ \et]+" }
      { print $2, $1 }
.Ed
.Pp
Add up first column, print sum and average:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
{ s += $1 }
END { print "sum is", s, " average is", s/NR }
.Ed
.Pp
Print all lines between start/stop pairs:
.Pp
.Dl /start/, /stop/
.Pp
Simulate echo(1):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
BEGIN { # Simulate echo(1)
        for (i = 1; i < ARGC; i++) printf "%s ", ARGV[i]
        printf "\en"
        exit }
.Ed
.Pp
Print an error message to standard error:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
{ print "error!" > "/dev/stderr" }

.Pp
The input is normally made up of input lines
.Pq records
separated by newlines, or by the value of
.Va RS .
If
.Va RS
is null, then any number of blank lines are used as the record separator,
and newlines are used as field separators
(in addition to the value of
.Va FS ) .
This is convenient when working with multi-line records.

d115 7
a121 20
Normally, any number of blanks separate fields.
In order to set the field separator to a single blank, use the
.Fl F
option with a value of
.Sq [\ \&] .
If a field separator of
.Sq t
is specified,
.Nm
treats it as if
.Sq \et
had been specified and uses
.Aq TAB
as the field separator.
In order to use a literal
.Sq t
as the field separator, use the
.Fl F
option with a value of
.Sq [t] .

and returns the previous seed.
If
.Fa expr
is omitted, the time of day is used instead.
.El
.Ss String Functions
.Bl -tag -width "split(s, a, fs)"
.It Fn gsub r t s
The same as
.Fn sub
except that all occurrences of the regular expression are replaced.
.Fn gsub
returns the number of replacements.
.It Fn index s t
The position in
.Fa s
where the string
.Fa t
occurs, or 0 if it does not.

taken as a string,
or of
.Va $0
if no argument is given.
.It Fn match s r
The position in
.Fa s
where the regular expression

The variable
.Va RSTART
is set to the starting position of the matched string
.Pq which is the same as the returned value
or zero if no match is found.
The variable
.Va RLENGTH
is set to the length of the matched string,
or \-1 if no match is found.
.It Fn split s a fs
Splits the string
.Fa s
into array elements
.Va a[1] , a[2] , ... , a[n]
and returns
.Va n .
The separation is done with the regular expression

.Fa s
with regular expression
.Fa r .
A literal ampersand can be specified by preceding it with two backslashes
.Pq Sq \e\e .

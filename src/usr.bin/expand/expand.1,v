.Sh NAME
.Nm expand ,
.Nm unexpand
.Nd expand tabs to spaces, and vice versa
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm expand
.Op Fl Ns Ar tabstop
.Op Fl Ns Ar tab1 , tab2 , ... , tabn
.Op Ar file Ar ...
.Nm unexpand
.Op Fl a
.Op Ar file Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm expand
processes the named files or the standard input writing
the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.
Backspace characters are preserved into the output and decrement
the column count for tab calculations.
.Nm expand
is useful for pre-processing character files
(before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that
contain tabs.
.Pp
If a single
.Ar tabstop
argument is given, tabs are set
.Ar tabstop
spaces apart instead of the default 8.
If multiple tabstops are given then the tabs are set at those
specific columns.
.Pp
.Nm unexpand
puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named
files and writes the result on the standard output.
.Pp
The options (for
.Nm unexpand
only) are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a
By default, only leading blanks and tabs
are reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.
If the
.Fl a
option is given, tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the
resultant file by replacing two or more characters.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fold 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm expand
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

In the synopsis above, both forms of the
.Nm
command are identical.
.Pp
If a list of tabstops is given, it should consist of a list
of two or more positive decimal integers, in ascending order.
In the event of having to process a
.Aq tab
at a position beyond the last of those specified in a multiple tabstop list,
the
.Aq tab
is replaced by a single
.Aq space
character.

The

specification, with the following exceptions:

does not support specifying tabstops without use of the

above).
.It
.Tn POSIX
specifies that multiple tabstops may be given separated by
commas or blanks.
This implementation supports only comma-separated tabstops.
.It
.Nm unexpand
does not recognise the
.Fl t
flag.

@cleanup a bit; use mirbsdksh for everything
mirbsdksh is destined at build time:
 - in Makefile via ${MKSH} inherited from <bsd.own.mk>-current
 - in Makefile.boot via editing the file itself
 - if not given to the C code, the manpage will look evil and
   the C code will use _PATH_BSHELL (and warn) or fall back to
   "/bin/mksh" (and not warn)
 - for the manpage via Makefile
mirbsdksh is given at run time in ${SHELL} by <sys.mk>-current

@almost better infrastructure for building MirMake on
tg@@linuxsys:/services/homes/tg $ uname -a
Linux LinuxSys.de 2.6.4 #1 Sat Mar 20 01:04:34 CET 2004 i686 GNU/Linux

I think my .if/.else/.endif replacement is "good enough" to
even work on very old makes (seen at FSF makefiles for ancient
systems)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm du
.Nd display disk usage statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm du
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Op Fl a | Fl s
.Op Fl ckrx
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the file system block usage for each
.Ar file
argument
and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
argument.
Note that the system block usage is usually greater than
the actual size of the file.
If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy rooted in
the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
Symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
All symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
No symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl a
Display an entry for each file in the file hierarchy.
.It Fl k
By default,
.Nm
displays the number of blocks as returned by the
.Xr stat 2
system call, i.e., 512-byte blocks.
If the
.Fl k
flag is specified, the number displayed is the number of 1024-byte
blocks.
Partial numbers of blocks are rounded up.
.It Fl c
Display the grand total after all the arguments have been processed.
.It Fl s
Display only the grand total for the specified files.
.It Fl r
Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
that cannot be opened, and so on.
This is the default case.
This option exists solely for conformance with
.St -xpg4 .
.It Fl x
File system mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the files they
reference unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is specified.
If either the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links which are
followed is not counted or displayed.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options override each other and the command's actions are determined
by the last one specified.
.Pp
Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
time per
.Nm
execution.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
Block counts will be displayed in units of this size block, unless the
.Fl k
or
.Fl h
option is specified.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

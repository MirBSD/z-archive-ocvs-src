.Sh NAME
.Nm fsplit
.Nd split a multi-routine Fortran file into individual files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsplit
.Op Fl e Ar efile Op Ar ...
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes as input either a file or standard input containing Fortran source code.
It attempts to split the input into separate routine files of the
form
.Ar name.f ,
where
.Ar name
is the name of the program unit (e.g., function, subroutine, block data or
program).
.Pp
The name for unnamed block data subprograms has the form
.Ar blkdtaNNN.f ,
where NNN is three digits and a file of this name does not already exist.
For unnamed main programs the name has the form
.Ar mainNNN.f .
If there is an error in classifying a program unit, or if
.Ar name.f
already exists,
the program unit will be put in a file of the form
.Ar zzzNNN.f ,
where
.Ar zzzNNN.f
does not already exist.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e Ar efile
Normally each subprogram unit is split into a separate file.
When the
.Fl e
option is used, only the specified subprogram units are split into separate
files. e.g.,
.Pp
.Dl $ fsplit -e readit -e doit prog.f
.Pp
will split
.Dq readit
and
.Dq doit
into separate files.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If names specified via the
.Fl e
option are not found, a diagnostic is written to
standard error.
.Sh AUTHORS
Asa Romberger and Jerry Berkman
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
assumes the subprogram name is on the first noncomment line of the subprogram
unit.
Non-standard source formats may confuse
.Nm fsplit .
.Pp
It is hard to use
.Fl e
for unnamed main programs and block data subprograms since you must
predict the created file name.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Op Fl f Ar flags
.Op Fl g Ar group

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (or copied if the
.Fl c
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is moved into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is
either renamed to
.Ar file.old
if the
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow, An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Backup any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to
.Ar file.old .
See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl C
Copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then don't change the modification time of the target.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This is actually the default.
The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl d
Create directories.
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g
Specify a group.
A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl m
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod 1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner.
A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the modification time.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file doesn't already exist or is different,
then preserve the modification time of the file.
.It Fl S
Safe copy.
Normally,
.Nm
unlinks an existing target before installing the new file.
With the
.Fl S
flag a temporary file is used and then renamed to be
the target.
The reason this is safer is that if the copy or
rename fails, the existing target is left untouched.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Pa /usr/bin/strip
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
If the environment variable
.Ev STRIP
is set, it is used instead.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the
.Dq nodump
flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Pp
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value >0 is returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width INS@@XXXXXX -compact
.It Pa INS@@XXXXXX
If either
.Fl S
option is specified, or the
.Fl C
or
.Fl p
option is used in conjunction with the
.Fl s
option, temporary files named INS@@XXXXXX,
where XXXXXX is decided by
.Xr mkstemp 3 ,
are created in the target directory.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "STRIP"
.It Ev STRIP
For an alternate
.Xr strip 1
program to run.
Default is
.Pa /usr/bin/strip .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,
.Xr strip 1 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Fl C ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl S
flags are non-standard and should not relied upon for portability.
.Pp
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm
exits abnormally.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

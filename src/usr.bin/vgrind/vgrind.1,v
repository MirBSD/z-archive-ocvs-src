.Sh NAME
.Nm vgrind
.Nd grind nice listings of programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vgrind
.Op Fl
.Op Fl W
.Op Fl d Ar file
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl h Ar header
.Op Fl l Ar language
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl sn
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl x
.Ar name Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
formats the program sources which are arguments
in a nice style using
.Xr troff 1 .
Comments are placed in italics, keywords in bold face,
and the name of the current function is listed down the margin of each
page as it is encountered.
.Pp
.Nm
runs in two basic modes, filter mode (see the
.Fl f
option) or regular mode.
In filter mode
.Nm
acts as a filter in a manner similar to
.Xr tbl 1 .
The standard input is passed directly to the standard output except
for lines bracketed by the
.Em troff-like
macros:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \&.vS
starts processing
.It \&.vE
ends processing
.El
.Pp
These lines are formatted as described above.
The output from this filter can be passed to
.Xr troff 1
for output.
There need be no particular ordering with
.Xr eqn 1
or
.Xr tbl 1 .
.Pp
In regular mode
.Nm
accepts input files, processes them, and passes them to
.Xr troff 1
for output.
.Pp
In both modes
.Nm
passes any lines beginning with a decimal point without conversion.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl
Forces input to be taken from standard input (default if
.Fl f
is specified).
.It Fl W
Forces output to the (wide) Versatec printer rather than the (narrow)
Varian.
.It Fl d Ar file
Specifies an alternate language definitions
file (default is
.Pa /usr/share/misc/vgrindefs Ns ).
.It Fl f
Forces filter mode.
.It Fl h Ar header
Specifies a particular header to put on every output page (default is
the file name).
.It Fl l
Specifies the language to use.
Currently known are
.Tn PASCAL
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar p ,
.Tn MODEL
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar m ,
C
.Pf ( Fl l Ns Ar c
or the default),
.Tn CSH
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar csh ,
.Tn SHELL
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar sh ,
.Tn RATFOR
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar r ,
.Tn MODULA2
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar mod2 ,
.Tn YACC
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar yacc ,
.Tn LISP
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar isp ,
and
.Tn ICON
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar I .
.It Fl n
Forces no keyword bolding.
.It Fl s
Specifies a point size to use on output (exactly the same as the argument
of a .ps).
.It Fl t
Similar to the same option in
.Xr troff 1
causing formatted text to go to the standard output
.It Fl x
Outputs the index file in a
.Dq pretty
format.
The index file itself is produced whenever
.Nm
is run with a file called
.Pa index
in the current directory.
The index of function
definitions can then be run off by giving
.Nm
the
.Fl x
option and the file
.Pa index
as argument.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/misc/vgrindefsxx -compact
.It Pa index
file where source for index is created
.It Pa /usr/share/tmac/tmac.vgrind
macro package
.It Pa /usr/libexec/vfontedpr
preprocessor
.It Pa /usr/share/misc/vgrindefs
language descriptions
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpr 1 ,
.Xr troff 1 ,
.Xr getcap 3 ,
.Xr vgrindefs 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
vfontedpr assumes that a certain programming style is followed:
.Pp
For
.Tn C
\- function names can be preceded on a line only by spaces, tabs, or an
asterisk.
The parenthesized arguments must also be on the same line.
.Pp
For
.Tn PASCAL
\- function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords
.Em function
or
.Em procedure .
.Pp
For
.Tn MODEL
\- function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords
.Em is beginproc .
.Pp
If these conventions are not followed, the indexing and marginal function
name comment mechanisms will fail.
.Pp
More generally, arbitrary formatting styles for programs mostly look bad.
The use of spaces to align source code fails miserably; if you plan to
.Nm
your program you should use tabs.
This is somewhat inevitable since the font used by
.Nm
is variable width.
.Pp
The mechanism of
.Xr ctags 1
in recognizing functions should be used here.
.Pp
Filter mode does not work in documents using the
.Fl me
or
.Fl ms
macros.
(So what use is it anyway?)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm file2c
.Op Ar string
.Op Ar string
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads a file from the standard input and writes it to the standard
output, converting each
byte to its decimal representation on the fly.
.Pp
If the first
.Ar string
is present, it is printed before the data.
If the second
.Ar string
is present, it is printed after the data.
.Pp
This program is used to embed binary or other files into C source files,
for instance as a
.Li char[] .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ date | file2c 'const char date[] = {' ',0};'
.Ed
.Pp
will produce:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const char date[] = {
83,97,116,32,74,97,110,32,50,56,32,49,54,58,50,56,58,48,53,

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

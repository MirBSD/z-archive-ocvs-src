.Sh NAME
.Nm asa ,
.Nm fpr
.Nd interpret carriage-control characters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm asa
.Op Ar
.Nm fpr
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads files sequentially, mapping
.Tn FORTRAN
carriage-control characters to line-printer control sequences,
and writes them to the standard output.
.Pp
The first character of each line is interpreted as a carriage-control
character.
Additionally, the following characters are interpreted as shown:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It <space>
Output the rest of the line without change.
.It 0
Output a newline
.Pq Sq \en
character before printing the rest of the line.
.It 1
Output a <formfeed> character before printing the rest of the line.
.It +
The trailing newline
.Pq Sq \en
of the previous line is replaced by a carriage-return
.Pq Sq \er
before printing the rest of the line.
.El
.Pp
Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated as if they
begin with a space
.Pq Sq \ .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To view a file containing the output of a
.Tn FORTRAN program:
.Pp
.Dl $ asa file
.Pp
To format the output of a
.Tn FORTRAN
program and redirect it to a line-printer.
.Pp
.Dl $ a.out | asa | lpr
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr f77 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.2-92 .
The
.Nm fpr
utility is deprecated and its use should be restricted.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

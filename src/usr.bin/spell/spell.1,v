.Fl m
.Ar m | s | e | a | l

.Op Fl s Ar stop

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm spell
collects words from the named documents and looks them up in a spelling list.
Words that neither occur among nor are derivable (by applying certain
inflections, prefixes or suffixes) from words in the spelling list
are printed on the standard output.
.Pp
If no files are named, words are collected from the standard input.
.Nm
ignores most
.Xr troff 1 ,
.Xr tbl 1 ,
.Xr eqn 1
and
.Xr pic 1
constructions.
Copies of all output may be accumulated in the history file,
if one is specified.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
(like
.Xr deroff 1 )
follows chains of included files (`.so' and `.nx' commands).
.Pp
The default spelling list is based on Webster's Second International
dictionary and should be fairly complete.
Words that appear in the
.Dq stop list
are immediately flagged as misspellings, regardless of whether or not
they exist in one of the word lists.
This helps filter out misspellings (e.g. thier=thy\-y+ier)
that would otherwise pass.
Additionally, the
.Pa british
file is also used as a stop list unless the
.Fl b
option is specified.
.Pp
Site administrators may add words to the local word list,
.Pa /usr/local/share/dict/words
or the local stop list, 
.Pa /usr/local/share/dict/stop .
.Pp
All word (and stop) lists must be sorted in lexigraphical order
with case folded.
The simplest way to achieve this is to use
.Dq sort -df .
If the word files are incorrectly sorted,
.Nm
will not be able to operate correctly.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Check British spelling.
Besides preferring
.Em centre , colour , speciality , travelled ,
etc., this option insists upon
.Fl ise
in words like
.Em standardise ,
Fowler and the OED to the contrary notwithstanding.
In this mode, American variants of words are added to the stop list.
.It Fl i
Instruct
.Xr deroff 1
to ignore `.so' and `.nx' commands.
.It Fl l
Use
.Xr delatex
instead of
.Xr deroff 1
if it is present on the system.
.It Fl t
Use
.Xr detex
instead of
.Xr deroff 1
if it is present on the system.
.It Fl v
Print all words not literally in the spelling list in addition to
plausible derivations from spelling list words.
.It Fl x
Print every plausible stem, prefixed with `='.
.It Fl d Ar word_list
Use the specified word list instead of the default system word list.
The word list must be sorted as specified above.
.It Fl h Ar spellhist
Store misspelled words in the specified history file.
The output of
.Li who -m
is appended to the history file after the list of misspelled words.
.It Fl m
Enable support for common
.Xr troff 1
macro packages; this option is passed verbatim to
.Xr deroff 1 .
The
.Fl m
option takes the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It a
recognize 
.Xr man 7
macros.
.It e
recognize 
.Xr me 7
macros.
.It m
recognize 
.Xr me 7
macros.
.It s
recognize 
.Xr me 7
macros.
.It l
recognize 
.Xr mm 7
macros and delete
.Xr mm 7
lists.
.El
.It Fl s Ar stop_list
Use the specified stop list instead of the default system stop list.
The stop list must be sorted as specified above.
.It + Ns Ar extra_list
Use
.Ar extra_list
in addition to the default word list.
The extra word list must be sorted as specified above. 
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/local/share/dict/wordsxx -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/words
Default spelling list
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/american
American spelling of certain words
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/british
British spelling of certain words
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/stop
Default stop list.
.It Pa /usr/local/share/dict/words
Local spelling list (optional)
.It Pa /usr/local/share/dict/stop
Local stop list (optional)
.It Pa /usr/libexec/spellprog
Binary executed by the shell script
.Pa /usr/bin/spell .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr deroff 1 ,
.Xr look 1 ,
.Xr sed 1 ,
.Xr sort 1 ,
.Xr tee 1 ,
.Xr troff 1
.Sh BUGS
The spelling list lacks many technical terms; new installations will
probably wish to monitor the output for several months to gather local
additions.
.Pp
British spelling was done by an American.
.Pp
In
.Fl x
mode it would be nicer if the stems were grouped with the appropriate word.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm spell
command appeared in
.At v6 .
.Pp
Unlike historic versions, the
.Ox
.Nm
command does not use hashed word files.
Instead, it uses lexigraphically sorted files and the same technique as
.Xr look 1 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

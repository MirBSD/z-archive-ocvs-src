.Dt WHAT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm what
.Nd "show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm what
.Op Ar file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads each
.Ar file
and searches for sequences of either the form
.Dq $
immediately followed by the system name (sysname) as defined by
.Xr uname 3 ,
or the form
.Dq \&@@(#)
as inserted by the source code control system.
It prints the remainder
of the string following this marker, up to a NUL, newline, double
quote, backslash, or
.Ql >
character.
.Pp
Since
.Ox 3.4 ,
the ability of the
.Nm
utility to operate on stdin was removed for
.St -p1003.1
compliance.
In
.Mx ,
the old behaviour is retained, and the
.Nm
version in
.Mx 5
and up is not
.St -p1003.1
compliant.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a return value of 0 if any identification strings were found,
or with a return value of 1 otherwise.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be a superset of the
.St -p1003.1
specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
As
.Bx
is not licensed to distribute
.Tn SCCS ,
this is a rewrite of the
.Nm
command which is part of
.Tn SCCS .
As such it may not behave exactly the same as that
command does.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

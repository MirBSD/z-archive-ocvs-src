.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm radioctl
.Nd control radio tuners
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm radioctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl a
.Nm radioctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Ar name
.Nm radioctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name=value
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various variables that affect the radio tuner
behavior. If a variable is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of this variable for the specified device.
By default,
.Nm
operates on the
.Pa /dev/radio
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
.It Fl w Ar name=value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative radio tuner device.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name.
.El
.Pp
Values may be specified in either absolute or relative forms.
The relative form is indicated by a prefix of
.Ql +
or
.Ql -
to denote an increase or decrease, respectively.
.Pp
The exact set of controls that can be manipulated depends on
the tuner.
The general format (in both getting and setting a value) is
.Pp
.Va name = value
.Pp
The
.Va name
indicates what part of the tuner the control affects.
.Pp
Write only controls:
.Bl -tag -width search
.It Ar search
Only for cards that allow hardware search. Can be
.Ql up
or
.Ql down .
.El
.Pp
Read-write controls:
.Bl -tag -width volume
.It Ar frequency
Float value from 87.5 to 108.0.
.It Ar volume
Integer value from 0 to 255.
.It Ar mute
Mutes the card (volume is not affected),
.Ql on
or
.Ql off .
.It Ar mono
Forces card output to mono,
.Ql on
or
.Ql off .
Only for cards that allow forced mono.
.It Ar reference
Reference frequency. Can be 25 kHz, 50 kHz and 100 kHz. Not all cards allow
the reference frequency to be changed.
.It Ar sensitivity
Station locking sensitivity. Can be 5 mkV, 10 mkV, 30 mkV and 150 mkV. Not all
cards allow the station locking sensitivity to be changed.
.El
.Pp
All the remaining controls (signal, stereo and card capabilities) are read-only
and can be viewed using option
.Fl a .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Pp
.Dl "$ radioctl -a"
.Pp
can produce
.Bd -literal
volume=255
frequency=106.30MHz
mute=off
reference=50kHz
signal=on
stereo=on
card capabilities:
        manageable mono/stereo
.Ed
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable affects the execution of
.Nm radioctl :
.Bl -tag -width RADIODEVICE
.It Ev RADIODEVICE
The radio tuner device to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/radio
.It Pa /dev/radio
radio tuner device
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr radio 4
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

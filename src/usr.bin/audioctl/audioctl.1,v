.Sh NAME
.Nm audioctl
.Nd control audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm audioctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl a
.Nm audioctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Ar name
.Op Ar ...
.Nm audioctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n

.Ar name=value
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various audio system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
By default,
.Nm
operates on the
.Pa /dev/audioctl
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
.It Fl w Ar name=value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative audio control device.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set the playing sampling rate to 11025 you can enter
.Pp
.Dl $ audioctl -w play.sample_rate=11025
.Pp
Note that many of the variables that can be inspected and changed
are reset when the device is opened.
This can be circumvented like so:
.Pp
.Dl $ (cat file.au; audioctl -f /dev/stdout -a) > /dev/audio
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Dl $ (audioctl -f /dev/stdout -w blocksize=1024; cat file.au) > /dev/audio
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width AUDIOCTLDEVICE
.It Ev AUDIOCTLDEVICE
Audio control device to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/audioctl
.It Pa /dev/audioctl
default audio control device
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mixerctl 1 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.4
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

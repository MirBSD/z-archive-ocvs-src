# iff:	file(1) magic for Interchange File Format (see also "audio" & "images")
#
# Daniel Quinlan (quinlan@@yggdrasil.com) -- IFF was designed by Electronic
# Arts for file interchange.  It has also been used by Apple, SGI, and
# especially Commodore-Amiga.
#
# IFF files begin with an 8 byte FORM header, followed by a 4 character
# FORM type, which is followed by the first chunk in the FORM.

0	string		FORM		IFF data
#>4	belong		x		\b, FORM is %d bytes long
# audio formats
>8	string		AIFF		\b, AIFF audio
>8	string		AIFC		\b, AIFF-C compressed audio
>8	string		8SVX		\b, 8SVX 8-bit sampled sound voice
>8	string		SAMP		\b, SAMP sampled audio
# image formats
>8	string		ILBMBMHD	\b, ILBM interleaved image
>>20	beshort		x		\b, %d x
>>22	beshort		x		%d
>8	string		RGBN		\b, RGBN 12-bit RGB image
>8	string		RGB8		\b, RGB8 24-bit RGB image
>8	string		DR2D		\b, DR2D 2-D object
>8	string		TDDD		\b, TDDD 3-D rendering
# other formats
>8	string		FTXT		\b, FTXT formatted text

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kdump
.Op Fl dnlRT
.Op Fl e Ar emulation
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar maxdata
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Op Fl t Op ceinsw
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human-readable format.
By default, the file
.Pa ktrace.out
in the current directory is displayed, unless overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
By default, values are printed out in hexadecimal.
.It Fl e Ar emulation
Interpret system call maps assuming the named emulation instead of
.Qq bsd .
For example, to view trace output from a Linux binary, use
.Fl e Ar linux .
.It Fl f Ar file
Display the specified file instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
.It Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.It Fl m Ar maxdata
Display at most
.Ar maxdata
bytes when decoding
.Tn I/O .
.It Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.
Normally
.Nm
tries to decode many system calls into a more human-readable format.
For example,
.Xr ioctl 2
values are replaced with the macro name and
.Va errno
values are replaced with the
.Xr strerror 3
string.
Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent output format and is
easily amenable to further processing.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Show output only for the
.Ar pid
specified.
.It Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
.It Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since epoch).
.It Fl t Op ceinsw
Selects which tracepoints to display. See the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr ktrace 1
for the definitions of the flags. 
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ktrace.out -compact
.It Pa ktrace.out

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

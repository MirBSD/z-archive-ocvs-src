.Nm nm
.Nd display name list (symbol table)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nm
.Op Fl aCegnopruw
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The symbol table (name list) of each object in
.Ar file(s)
is displayed.
If a library (archive) is given,
.Nm
displays a list for each
object archive member.
If
.Ar file
is not present,
.Nm
searches for the file
.Pa a.out
and displays its symbol table if it exists.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.
.It Fl C
Decode low-level symbol names. This involves removing extra underscores
and making C++ function names readable.
.It Fl e
Output extended information, that is `w' for weak symbols, `f' for
function-like symbols, and `o' for object-like symbols.
.It Fl g
Restrict display to external (global) symbols.
.It Fl n
Present results in numerical order.
.It Fl o
Display full path or library name of object on every line.
.It Fl p
Do not sort at all.
.It Fl r
Reverse order sort.
.It Fl u
Display undefined symbols only.
.It Fl w
Warn about non-object archive members.
Normally,
.Nm nm
will silently ignore all archive members which are not
object files.
.El
.Pp
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol
is undefined) and one of the following letters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Fl
debugger symbol table entries (see the
.Fl a
option).
.It Li A
absolute
.It Li B
bss segment symbol
.It Li C
common symbol
.It Li D
data segment symbol
.It Li I
indirect reference (alias to other symbol)
.It Li f
file name
.It Li T
text segment symbol
.It Li U
undefined
.El
.Pp
If the symbol is local (non-external) the type letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

@big effort: make nroff 8-bit clean by converting the hi-bit7 characters
to binary values (8 times a symbolic character, preceded by an escape
symbolic character) in a preprocessing step, and reconstructing them in
a postprocessing step.

This only works with "nrcon" because it requires some special magic.

@... believe me, you don't want to fix AT&T code
- strlcpy, strlcat, sprintf
- sync licence, bump to 2004
- fix NULL != 0 or '\0'

@the first part of making a release (non-X)
* sync sets (for now)
* mention set sizes in INSTALL.i386
* install all files, but not more than wanted
* fix build time warnings
  (the mktemp in lpd is said to be safe)
* update docs a bit
* the eqn -> neqn move
* improved man page generation
* anoncvsbin removes tmp before making new symlink
* sendmail generated files are now in sendmail, and
  SKIPDIRS is checked before (asked for by Waldemar Brodkorb)
* more SKIPDIR checks, mostly for GNU stuff

@there's now such thing as -Tcol (-Tascii, -Tlatin1, which were
equivalent to -T -Tlpr -Tcrt before), which peruses the post
processing col(1) does to perform backward line feeding, which
allows nroff(1) to output multi-column text.

nrcol(1) with no manual page feeds its input and command line
parametres to nroff -Tcol, and that's output to col(1), whose
output is then given back to the caller.

<bsd.doc.mk> now peruses nrcol(1).

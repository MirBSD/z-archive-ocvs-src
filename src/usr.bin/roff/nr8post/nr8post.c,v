@big effort: make nroff 8-bit clean by converting the hi-bit7 characters
to binary values (8 times a symbolic character, preceded by an escape
symbolic character) in a preprocessing step, and reconstructing them in
a postprocessing step.

This only works with "nrcon" because it requires some special magic.

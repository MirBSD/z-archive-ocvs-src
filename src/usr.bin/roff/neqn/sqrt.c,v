1.1
log
@the first part of making a release (non-X)
* sync sets (for now)
* mention set sizes in INSTALL.i386
* install all files, but not more than wanted
* fix build time warnings
  (the mktemp in lpd is said to be safe)
* update docs a bit
* the eqn -> neqn move
* improved man page generation
* anoncvsbin removes tmp before making new symlink
* sendmail generated files are now in sendmail, and
  SKIPDIRS is checked before (asked for by Waldemar Brodkorb)
* more SKIPDIR checks, mostly for GNU stuff

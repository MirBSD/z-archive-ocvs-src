.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm who
.Op Fl mqTuH
.Op Ar file
.Nm who
.Ar am i
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays a list of all users currently logged on, showing for
each user the login name, tty name, the date and time of login, and
hostname if not local.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m
Only print information about the current terminal.
This is the
.Tn POSIX
way of saying
.Nm
.Ar am i .
.It Fl q
(Quick.)
List only the names and the number of users currently logged on.
When this option is used, all other options are ignored.
.It Fl T
Print a character after the user name indicating the state of the
terminal line:
.Sq +
if the terminal is writable;
.Sq \-
if it is not;
and
.Sq ?
if a bad line is encountered.
.It Fl u
Print the idle time for each user.
.It Fl H
Write column headings above the regular output.
.It Ar \&am I
Returns the invoker's real user name.
.It Ar file
By default,
.Nm
gathers information from the file
.Pa /var/run/utmp .
An alternate
.Ar file
may be specified which is usually
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
(or
.Pa /var/log/wtmp.[0-6]
depending on site policy as
.Pa wtmp
can grow quite large and daily versions may or may not
be kept around after compression by
.Xr ac 8 ) .
The
.Pa wtmp
file contains a record of every login, logout,
crash, shutdown and date change
since
.Pa wtmp
was last truncated or
created.
.El
.Pp
If
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
is being used as the file, the user name may be empty
or one of the special characters
.Ql | ,
.Ql } ,
and
.Ql \&~ .
Logouts produce an output line without any user name.
For more information on the special characters, see
.Xr utmp 5 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

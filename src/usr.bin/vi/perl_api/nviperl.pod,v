@=head1 NAME

nviperl - nvi with embedded perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    :perl require 'wc.pl'
    :perl wc
    :,$perldo $_=reverse($_)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

nvi with embedded perl allows you to run perl commands from within nvi.
Two additional commands are made available when you enable the perl
interpreter:

=over 8

=item * perl cmd

The perl command passes the specified commands to the perl interpreter.
The C<$VI::ScreenId>, C<$VI::StartLine> and C<$VI::StopLine> are set.
To find out how to maniplulate the nvi screens, see L<VI>.

=item * perldo cmd

The perldo command runs the specified commands on each line of the range
(every line of the file if no range specified).  Before running the
command the line is copied into $_.  If the command returns a true value
the line is replaced by the new value of $_.

The perldo commando does B<not> set the C<VI> variables.  (If you think
this is a bad idea, tell me.)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

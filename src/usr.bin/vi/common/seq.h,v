 * Map and abbreviation structures.
 *
 * The map structure is doubly linked list, sorted by input string and by
 * input length within the string.  (The latter is necessary so that short
 * matches will happen before long matches when the list is searched.)
 * Additionally, there is a bitmap which has bits set if there are entries
 * starting with the corresponding character.  This keeps us from walking
 * the list unless it's necessary.
 *
 * The name and the output fields of a SEQ can be empty, i.e. NULL.
 * Only the input field is required.
 *
 * XXX
 * The fast-lookup bits are never turned off -- users don't usually unmap
 * things, though, so it's probably not a big deal.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

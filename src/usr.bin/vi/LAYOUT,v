#	@@(#)LAYOUT	8.12 (Berkeley) 10/10/96

LAYOUT
	This file: the layout of the nvi sources.

LICENSE
	Nvi's copyright notice and conditions for redistribution.

README
	Welcome message and basic information.

build/
	The build/configuration directory for nvi.  See build/README for
	more information.

catalog/
	Support for message catalogs for nvi.  See catalog/README for more
	information.

cl/
	Source files for nvi's curses screen support.

clib/
	Replacement source files for C library functions.

common/
	Source files for pieces of code that are shared by ex and vi,
	e.g., searching and logging code or code translating line numbers
	into requests to the dbopen(3) database code.  It also has the
	interface code for modifying "records" in the underlying database.

curses/
	A stripped-down replacement curses library.  Do not try and use
	this library outside of nvi, many standard curses functions have
	been removed because nvi doesn't use them.  See build/README for
	more information.

db/
	A stripped-down replacement DB library.  Do not try and use this
	library outside of nvi, many standard DB functions have been
	removed because nvi doesn't use them.  See db/README for more
	information.

docs/
	Ex/vi documentation, both current and historic.

	USD.doc/
		[USD stands for "User's Supplementary Documents".]

		edit/   Roff source for "Edit: A tutorial".  This document
			was USD:14 in the 4.3BSD manuals, but was not
			distributed with 4.4BSD.

		exref/  Roff source for "Ex Reference Manual -- Version
			3.7".  This document was USD:16 in the 4.3BSD
			manuals, and USD tabbed 12 in the 4.4BSD manuals.

		vi.man/ Roff source for a UNIX manual page for nex/nvi.
			An updated version of the 4.4BSD manual page.

		vi.ref/ Roff source for the nex/nvi reference document.
			An updated version of the 4.4BSD document, USD
			tabbed 13.

		vitut/  Roff source for "An Introduction to Display
			Editing with Vi".  This document was USD:15 in
			the 4.3BSD manuals, but was not distributed with
			4.4BSD.  It includes the historic "Vi Quick
			Reference" card.


		PostScript preformatted versions of the nex/nvi reference
		manual and manual page are in the files named with a ".ps"
		suffix, in their respective source directories.  Flat text
		preformatted versions of the nex/nvi reference manual and
		manual page are in the files named with a ".txt" suffix,
		in their respective source directories.

	changelog	-- Log of changes from version to version.
	features	-- Todo list, suggested features list.
	internals/
	    autowrite	-- Vi autowrite option discussion.
	    context	-- Previous context marks discussion.
	    gdb.script	-- GDB debugging scripts.
	    input	-- Vi maps, executable buffers, and input discussion.
	    openmode	-- Open mode behaviors.
	    quoting	-- Vi quoting discussion.
	    structures	-- Out-of-date nvi internal structure description.
	tutorial/	-- Historic vi tutorial(s), of unknown quality.

ex/
	The ex source code.  Because vi has the colon command, lots of
	this code is used by vi.  Generally, if functionality is shared
	by both ex and vi, it's in the ex directory.  If it's vi only,
	it's in the vi directory.  Files are generally named by the
	command(s) they support, but occasionally with a name that
	describes their functionality.

	version.h	-- Version information.

include/
	Replacement include files:

	bitstring.h	-- The 4.4BSD bitstring operations.
	sys/queue.h	-- The 4.4BSD queue operations.

perl_api/
	Source code supporting the Perl scripting language for nvi.

perl_scripts/
	Scripts for Perl included with nvi.

regex/
	Henry Spencer's POSIX 1003.2 regular expression (RE) library.

tcl_api/
	Source code supporting the Tcl scripting language for nvi.

tcl_scripts/
	Scripts for Tcl included with nvi.

tk/
	Source files for nvi's Tk screen support.

	init.tcl	-- Vi startup tcl script.

vi/
	The vi source code.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@	@@(#)openmode	8.1 (Berkeley) 10/29/94

Open mode has the following special behaviors:

z, ^F, ^B:
	If count is not specified, it shall default to the window
	edit option - 2.

	Write lines from the edit buffer starting at:

		(the current line) - ((count - 2) / 2)

	until:

		(((count + 1) / 2) * 2) - 1
	
	lines, or the last line in the edit buffer has been written.  A
	line consisting of the smaller of the number of columns in the
	display divided by two or 40 ``-'' characters shall be written
	immediately before and after the specified is written.  These two
	lines shall count against the total number of lines to be written.
	A blank line shall be written after the last line is written.

	z, ^F and ^B all behave identically.

^D:	Display the next scroll value lines, change the current line.

^U:	Change the current line, do nothing else.

^E, ^Y:	Do nothing.

^L:	Clear the screen and redisplay the current line.

H, L, M:
	Move to the first nonblank of the current line and do nothing
	else.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

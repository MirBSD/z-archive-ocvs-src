 h - cursor left   w - move forward a "word"   n - repeat the last search
 l - cursor right  b - move backward a "word"

:#<Enter>  - move to a line (e.g., :35<Enter> moves to line 35)

^G - display the file name
 J - join two lines (use i<Enter><escape> to split a line)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tftp
.Nd trivial file transfer program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tftp
.Op Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the user interface to the Internet
.Tn TFTP
(Trivial File Transfer Protocol),
which allows users to transfer files to and from a remote machine.
The remote
.Ar host
may be specified on the command line, in which case
.Nm
uses
.Ar host
as the default host for future transfers (see the
.Ic connect
command below).
.Sh COMMANDS
Once
.Nm
is running, it issues the prompt
.Ql tftp>
and recognizes the following commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width verbose -compact
.It Ic \&? Ar command-name Op Ar ...
Print help information.
.Pp
.It Ic ascii
Shorthand for
.Ic mode ascii .
.Pp
.It Ic binary
Shorthand for
.Ic mode binary .
.Pp
.It Ic connect Ar host Op Ar port
Set the
.Ar host
(and optionally
.Ar port )
for transfers.
Note that the
.Tn TFTP
protocol, unlike the
.Tn FTP
protocol,
does not maintain connections between transfers; thus, the
.Ic connect
command does not actually create a connection,
but merely remembers what host is to be used for transfers.
You do not have to use the
.Ic connect
command; the remote host can be specified as part of the
.Ic get
or
.Ic put
commands.
.Pp
.It Ic get Ar filename
.It Ic get Ar remotename localname
.It Ic get Ar file Op Ar ...
Get a file or set of files from the specified
.Ar sources .
.Ar source
can be in one of two forms:
a filename on the remote host, if the host has already been specified,
or a string of the form
.Ar hosts:filename
to specify both a host and filename at the same time.
If the latter form is used,
the last hostname specified becomes the default for future transfers.
.Pp
.It Ic mode Ar transfer-mode
Set the mode for transfers;
.Ar transfer-mode
may be one of
.Ic ascii
or
.Ic binary .
The default is
.Ic ascii .
.Pp
.It Ic put Ar file
.It Ic put Ar localfile remotefile
.It Ic put Ar file1 file2 ... fileN remote-directory
Put a file or set of files to the specified
remote file or directory.
The destination
can be in one of two forms:
a filename on the remote host, if the host has already been specified,
or a string of the form
.Ar hosts:filename
to specify both a host and filename at the same time.
If the latter form is used,
the hostname specified becomes the default for future transfers.
If the remote-directory form is used, the remote host is
assumed to be a
.Tn UNIX
machine.
.Pp
.It Ic quit
Exit
.Nm tftp .
An end-of-file also exits.
.Pp
.It Ic rexmt Ar retransmission-timeout
Set the per-packet retransmission timeout, in seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic status
Show current status.
.Pp
.It Ic timeout Ar total-transmission-timeout
Set the total transmission timeout, in seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic trace
Toggle packet tracing.
.Pp
.It Ic verbose
Toggle verbose mode.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ftp 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Because there is no user login or validation within
the
.Tn TFTP
protocol, the remote site will probably have some
sort of file access restrictions in place.
The exact methods are specific to each site and therefore
difficult to document here.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

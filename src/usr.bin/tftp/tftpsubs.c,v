/* Simple minded read-ahead/write-behind subroutines for tftp user and
   server.  Written originally with multiple buffers in mind, but current
   implementation has two buffer logic wired in.

   Todo:  add some sort of final error check so when the write-buffer
   is finally flushed, the caller can detect if the disk filled up
   (or had an i/o error) and return a nak to the other side.

@This is Sudo version 1.6.7

The sudo philosophy
===================
Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges
to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few
privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.

Where to find sudo
==================
Before you try and build sudo, *please* make sure you have the current
version.  The latest sudo may always be gotten via anonymous ftp
from ftp.sudo.ws in the directory /pub/sudo/.
The distribution is sudo-M.m.tar.gz where `M' is the major
version number and `m' is the minor version number.
BETA versions of sudo may also be available.  If you join
the `sudo-workers' mailing list you will get the BETA announcements
(see the `Mailing lists' section below).

What's new
==========
For a history of sudo please see the HISTORY file that came with this
release.

For a complete list of changes, see the CHANGES file.  For a summary,
see the web page, http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Sudo, please see
the UPGRADE file.

NOTE: Starting with sudo 1.5.7 the configuration method has changed
      significantly as compared to previous versions.  All options
      are now set via the configure script.  See the `INSTALL' file
      for a list of all the configure options.

System requirements
===================
To build sudo from the source distribution you need a machine running
UN*X (most flavors of BSD, SYSV, or POSIX will do), a working C
compiler, and the make utility.

If you wish to modify the parser then you will need flex version
2.5.2 or later and either bison or byacc (sudo comes with a pre-flex'd
tokenizer and pre-yacc'd grammar parser).  You'll also have to
uncomment a few lines from the Makefile or run configure with the
--with-devel option.  You can get flex via anonymous ftp from
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/flex* as well as any GNU mirror.  You can
get GNU bison from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bison/ or any GNU
mirror.

Building the release
====================
Please read the installation guide in the `INSTALL' file before
trying to build sudo.  The `RUNSON' file contains a list of of
platforms that this version of sudo is known to work on.  If you
can add to this list, please send mail to sudo@@sudo.ws.  If
something goes wrong you may want to refer to the `TROUBLESHOOTING'
file.

Copyright
=========
Sudo is distributed under a BSD-style license.
Please refer to the `LICENSE' file included with the release for details.

Mailing lists
=============
sudo-announce	This list receives announcements whenever a new version
		of sudo is released.
		http://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-announce

sudo-users	This list is for questions and general discussion about sudo.
		http://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-users

sudo-workers	This list is for people working on and porting sudo.
		http://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-workers

To subscribe to a list, visit its url (as listed above) and enter
your email address to subscribe.  Digest versions are available but
these are fairly low traffic lists so the digest versions are not
a significant win.

Mailing list archives are also available.  See the mailing list web sites
for the appropriate links.

Web page
========
There is a sudo `web page' at http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/
that contains an overview of sudo as well as pointers to BETA versions
and other useful info.

Bug reports
===========
A list of known bugs may be found in the `BUGS' file.  If you have
found what you believe to be a bug, you can file a bug report with
the sudo bug database, on at web at http://www.sudo.ws/bugs/.

Please read over the `TROUBLESHOOTING' file *before* submitting a
bug report.  When reporting bugs, please be sure to include the
version of sudo you are using as well as the platform you are running
it on.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

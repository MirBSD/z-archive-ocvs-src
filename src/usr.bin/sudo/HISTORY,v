@A Brief history of sudo(8):

The sudo philosophy originated at SUNY-Buffalo in the early 1980's.
In the Summer of 1986, Garth Snyder enhanced sudo and released it
to the public.  For the next 5 years, sudo was fed and watered by
a handful of folks at CU-Boulder, including Bob Coggeshall, Bob
Manchek, and Trent Hein.

In 1991, Dave Hieb and Jeff Nieusma wrote a new version of sudo
with an enhanced sudoers format under contract to a consulting firm
called "The Root Group".  This version was later released under the
GNU public license.

In 1994, after maintaining sudo informally within CU-Boulder for
some time, Todd Miller made a public release of "CU sudo" (version
1.3) with bug fixes and support for more operating systems.  The
"CU" was added to differentiate it from the "official" version from
"The Root Group".

In 1996, Todd, who had been maintaining sudo for several years in
his spare time, brought sudo development under the umbrella of his
consulting firm, Courtesan Consulting.  Courtesan remains committed
to a free sudo and is sponsoring another sudo rewrite as well as
continued development of the sudo 1.x code base.

In 1999, the "CU" prefix was dropped from the name since there has
been no formal release of sudo from "The Root Group" since 1991
(the original authors now work elsewhere).  As of version 1.6, Sudo
no longer contains any of the original "Root Group" code and is
available with a BSD-style license.

sudo, in its current form, is maintained by:

	Todd Miller <Todd.Miller@@courtesan.com>

Todd continues to enhance sudo and fix bugs.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

The first version of sudo was written there by Cliff Spencer in
1983.  An updated version, credited to Phil Betchel, Cliff Spencer,
Gretchen Phillips, John LoVerso and Don Gworek, was posted to the
net.sources newsgroup in December of 1985.

Sudo was first conceived and implemented by Bob Coggeshall and Cliff
Spencer around 1980 at the Department of Computer Science at
SUNY/Buffalo.  It ran on a VAX-11/750 running 4.1BSD.  An updated
version, credited to Phil Betchel, Cliff Spencer, Gretchen Phillips,
John LoVerso and Don Gworek, was posted to the net.sources newsgroup
in December of 1985.

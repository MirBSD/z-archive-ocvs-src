The

displays the

.Ar name .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k
Locate man pages matching
.Ar keyword
in much the same way as
.Xr apropos 1
works (in fact, it runs
.Xr apropos 1
for you).
This can be used to find which man page applies to a particular subsystem
you are interested in, for instance
.Pp
.Nm man Fl k Em mount
.Pp
will list all man-pages which contain your
.Ar keyword
in the
.Em NAME
line of the man page;
in this case a list much like this:
.Bd -literal -offset xx
amd (8) - automatically mount file systems
amq (8) - automounter query tool
mount (8) - mount file systems
mount, unmount (2) - mount or dismount a filesystem
mount_ados (8) - mount an AmigaDOS file system
mount_cd9660 (8) - mount an ISO-9660 filesystem
mount_ext2fs (8) - mount a ext2fs file system
mount_fdesc (8) - mount the file-descriptor file system
mount_ffs, mount_ufs (8) - mount a Berkeley Fast File System
mount_kernfs (8) - mount the /kern file system
mount_procfs (8) - mount the process file system
mount_umap (8) - sample file system layer
mount_union (8) - mount union filesystems
mount_xfs (8) - mount the xfs filesystem
mountd (8) - service remote NFS mount requests
newfs, mount_mfs (8) - construct a new file system
umount (8) - unmount file systems
\&...
.Ed
.It Fl a
Display all of the manual pages for a specified
.Ar section
and
.Ar name
combination.
(Normally, only the first manual page found is displayed.)
.It Fl C Ar file
Use the specified
.Ar file
instead of the default configuration file.
This permits users to configure their own manual environment.
See
.Xr man.conf 5
for a description of the contents of this file.
.It Fl c
Copy the manual page to the standard output instead of using
.Xr more 1
to paginate it.
This is done by default if the standard output is not a terminal device.
.It Fl h
Display only the
.Dq Tn SYNOPSIS
lines of the requested manual pages.
.It Fl M Ar path
Override the list of standard directories which
.Nm
searches for manual pages.
The supplied
.Ar path
must be a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
separated list of directories.
This search path may also be set using the environment variable
.Ev MANPATH .
The subdirectories to be searched, and their search order,
is specified by the
.Dq _subdir
line in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Fl m Ar path
Augment the list of standard directories which
.Nm
searches for manual pages.
The supplied
.Ar path
must be a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
separated list of directories.
These directories will be searched before the standard directories or
the directories specified using the
.Fl M
option or the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable.
The subdirectories to be searched, and their search order,
is specified by the
.Dq _subdir
line in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Fl s Ar section
Another way of specifying the section, for compatibility with
.Nm
on other operating systems.
.It Fl S Ar subsection
Specifies the machine-dependent subsection.
This overrides the
.Ev MACHINE
environment variable.
See the
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
section below.
.It Fl w
List the pathnames of the manual pages which
.Nm
would display for the specified
.Ar section
and
.Ar name
combination.
.It Fl f
Locate man pages matching the
.Ar command
in much the same way
.Xr whatis 1
works.
.El
.Pp
The optional
.Ar section
argument restricts the directories that
.Nm
will search.
The
.Nm
configuration file (see
.Xr man.conf 5 )
specifies the possible
.Ar section
values that are currently available.
If only a single argument is specified or if the first argument is
not a valid section,
.Nm
assumes that the argument is the name of a manual page to be displayed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MANPATHX
.It Ev MACHINE
As some manual pages are intended only for specific architectures,
.Nm
searches any subdirectories,
with the same name as the current architecture,
in every directory which it searches.
Machine specific areas are checked before general areas.
The current machine type may be overridden by setting the environment
variable
.Ev MACHINE
to the name of a specific architecture.
.It Ev MANPATH
The standard search path used by
.Nm
may be overridden by specifying a path in the
.Ev MANPATH
environment
variable.
The format of the path is a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
separated list of directories.
The subdirectories to be searched as well as their search order
is specified by the
.Dq _subdir
line in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Ev PAGER
Any non-null value of the environment variable
.Ev PAGER
will be used instead of the standard pagination program,
.Xr more 1 .

The on-line manual pages are, by necessity, forgiving toward stupid
display devices, causing a few manual pages to be not as nicely formatted
as their typeset counterparts.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

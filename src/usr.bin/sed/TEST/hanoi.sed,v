@#	$OpenBSD: hanoi.sed,v 1.2 1996/06/26 05:39:09 deraadt Exp $
# Towers of Hanoi in sed.
#
#	from: @@(#)hanoi.sed	8.1 (Berkeley) 6/6/93
#
#
# Ex:
# Run "sed -f hanoi.sed", and enter:
#
#	:abcd: : :<CR><CR>
#
# note -- TWO carriage returns, a peculiarity of sed), this will output the
# sequence of states involved in moving 4 rings, the largest called "a" and
# the smallest called "d", from the first to the second of three towers, so
# that the rings on any tower at any time are in descending order of size.
# You can start with a different arrangement and a different number of rings,
# say :ce:b:ax: and it will give the shortest procedure for moving them all
# to the middle tower.  The rules are: the names of the rings must all be
# lower-case letters, they must be input within 3 fields (representing the
# towers) and delimited by 4 colons, such that the letters within each field
# are in alphabetical order (i.e. rings are in descending order of size).
#
# For the benefit of anyone who wants to figure out the script, an "internal"
# line of the form
#		b:0abx:1a2b3 :2   :3x2
# has the following meaning: the material after the three markers :1, :2,
# and :3 represents the three towers; in this case the current set-up is
# ":ab :   :x  :".  The numbers after a, b and x in these fields indicate
# that the next time it gets a chance, it will move a to tower 2, move b
# to tower 3, and move x to tower 2.  The string after :0 just keeps track
# of the alphabetical order of the names of the rings.  The b at the
# beginning means that it is now dealing with ring b (either about to move
# it, or re-evaluating where it should next be moved to).
#
# Although this version is "limited" to 26 rings because of the size of the
# alphabet, one could write a script using the same idea in which the rings
# were represented by arbitrary [strings][within][brackets], and in place of
# the built-in line of the script giving the order of the letters of the
# alphabet, it would accept from the user a line giving the ordering to be
# assumed, e.g. [ucbvax][decvax][hplabs][foo][bar].

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

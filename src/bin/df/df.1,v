.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df
.Op Fl iklnP
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Oo
.Op Ar file | file_system
.Ar ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the
specified
.Ar file_system
or on the file system of which
.Ar file
is a part.
By default, values are displayed as 512-byte block counts.
If neither a file nor a
.Ar file_system
operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl l
and
.Fl t
options below).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl l
Display statistics only about mounted file systems with the
.Dv MNT_LOCAL
flag set.
If a non-local file system is given as an argument, a
warning is issued and no information is given on that file system.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file systems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
file systems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not request new statistics from the file systems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl P
Print out information in a stricter format designed to be parsed
by portable scripts.
.It Fl t Ar type
Indicate the actions should only be taken on
file systems of the specified
.Ar type .
More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list.
The list of file system types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the file system types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
If a file system is given on the command line that is not of
the specified type, a warning is issued and no information is given on
that file system.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
options are not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li $ df -kP /usr
.Pp
Output, in a strict format suitable for portable scripts, disk space
statistics for the
.Pa /usr
file system using kilobyte block sizes.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

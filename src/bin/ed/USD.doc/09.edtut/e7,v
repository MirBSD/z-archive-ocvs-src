Summary of Commands and Line Numbers
.PP
The general form of
.ul
ed
commands is the command name,
perhaps preceded by one or two line numbers, and,
in the case of
.UL e ,
.UL r ,
and
.UL w ,
followed by a file name.
Only one command is allowed per line,
but a
.UL p
command may follow any other command
(except for
.UL e ,
.UL r ,
.UL w
and
.UL q ).
.LP
.UL a :
Append, that is, 
add lines to the buffer (at line dot, unless
a different line is specified). Appending continues until
\*.
is typed on a new line.
Dot is set to the last line appended.
.LP
.UL c :
Change the specified lines to the new text which follows.
The new lines are terminated by a
\*.,
as with
.UL a .
If no lines are specified,
replace line dot.
Dot is set to last line changed.
.LP
.UL d :
Delete the lines specified.
If none are specified, delete line dot.
Dot is set to the first undeleted line,
unless
.UL $
is deleted,
in which case dot is set to
.UL $ .
.LP
.UL e :
Edit new file.
Any previous
contents of the buffer are thrown away,
so issue a
.UL w
beforehand.
.LP
.UL f :
Print remembered filename.
If a name follows
.UL f
the remembered name will be set to it.
.LP
.UL g :
The command
.P1
g/\(hy\(hy\(hy/commands
.P2
will execute the commands on those lines that contain
.UL --- ,
which can be any context search expression.
.LP
.UL i :
Insert lines before specified line (or dot)
until a
\*.
is typed on a new line.
Dot is set to last line inserted.
.LP
.UL m :
Move lines specified to after the line
named after
.UL m .
Dot is set to the last line moved.
.LP
.UL p :
Print specified lines.
If none specified, print
line dot.
A single line number is equivalent to
.IT line-number
.UL p .
A single return prints
.UL .+1 ,
the next line.
.LP
.UL q :
Quit
.IT ed .
Wipes out all text in buffer
if you give it twice in a row without first giving a
.UL w
command.
.LP
.UL r :
Read a file into buffer (at end unless specified
elsewhere.) Dot set to last line read.
.LP
.UL s :
The command
.P1
s/string1/string2/
.P2
substitutes the characters
.UL string1
into
.UL string2
in the specified lines.
If no lines are specified, make the substitution in line dot.
Dot is set to last line in which a
substitution took place, which means that if no substitution took place, dot is not changed.
.UL s
changes only the first occurrence of
.UL  string1 
on a line;
to change all of them, type a
.UL g
after the final slash.
.LP
.UL v :
The command
.P1
v/\(hy\(hy\(hy/commands
.P2
executes
.UL commands
on those lines that
.ul
do not
contain
.UL --- .
.LP
.UL w :
Write out buffer onto a file.
Dot is not changed.
.LP
.UL .= :
Print value of dot.
.UL = "" (
by itself prints the value of
.UL $ .)
.LP
.UL ! :
The line
.P1
!command\(hyline
.P2
causes
.UL command-line
to be executed as a
.UC UNIX
command.
.LP
.UL /-----/ :
Context search.
Search for next line which contains
this string of characters.
Print it.
Dot is set to the line where string
was found.
Search starts at
.UL .+1 ,
wraps around from
.UL $
to
1,
and continues to dot, if necessary.
.LP
.UL ?-----? :
Context search in reverse direction.
Start search
at
.UL .\-1 ,
scan to 1,
wrap around to
.UL $ .

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any

a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

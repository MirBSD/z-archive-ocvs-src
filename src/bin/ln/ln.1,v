.Sh NAME
.Nm ln
.Nd make hard and symbolic links to files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ln
.Op Fl fhns
.Ar source_file
.Op Ar target_file
.Nm ln
.Op Fl fhns
.Ar source_file ...
.Op Ar target_dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which has the
same modes as the original file.
It is useful for maintaining multiple copies of a file in many places
at once without using up storage for the copies;
instead, a link
.Dq points
to the original copy.
There are two types of links; hard links and symbolic links.
How a link points
to a file is one of the differences between a hard and symbolic link.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Unlink any already existing file, permitting the link to occur.
.It Fl h
If the target is a symlink to a directory, do not descend into it.
.It Fl n
An alias for
.Fl h
for compatibility with other operating systems.
.It Fl s
Create a symbolic link.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
makes
.Dq hard
links.
A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original directory entry;
any changes to a file are effectively independent of the name used to reference
the file.
Hard links may not normally refer to directories and may not span file systems.
.Pp
A symbolic link contains the name of the file to
which it is linked.
The referenced file is used when an
.Xr open 2
operation is performed on the link.
A
.Xr stat 2
on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an
.Xr lstat 2
must be done to obtain information about the link.
The
.Xr readlink 2
call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
Symbolic links may span file systems, refer to directories, and refer to
non-existent files.
.Pp
Given one or two arguments,
.Nm
creates a link to an existing file
.Ar source_file .
If
.Ar target_file
is given, the link has that name;
.Ar target_file
may also be a directory in which to place the link.
Otherwise, it is placed in the current directory.
If only the directory is specified, the link will be made
to the last component of
.Ar source_file .
.Pp
Given more than two arguments,
.Nm
makes links in
.Ar target_dir
to all the named source files.
The links made will have the same name as the files being linked to.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li # ln -s /var/www /home/www
.Pp
Creates a symbolic link named
.Pa /home/www
and points it to
.Pa /var/www .
.Pp
.Li # ln /usr/local/bin/fooprog-1.0 /usr/local/bin/fooprog
.Pp
Hard link
.Pa /usr/local/bin/fooprog
to file
.Pa /usr/local/bin/fooprog-1.0 .
.Pp
As an exercise, try the following commands:
.Pp
.D1 Ic $ ls -i /bin/[
.D1 Li 11553 /bin/[
.D1 Ic $ ls -i /bin/test
.D1 Li 11553 /bin/test
.Pp
Note that both files have the same inode; that is,
.Pa /bin/[
is essentially an alias for the
.Xr test 1
command.
This hard link exists so
.Xr test 1
may be invoked from shell scripts, for example, using the
.Li "if [ ]"
construct.
.Pp
.Li "$ mkdir bar baz; ln -s bar foo; ln -shf baz foo"
.Pp
The second call to
.Nm
removes the original
.Pa foo
and creates a replacement pointing to
.Pa baz .
Without the
.Ar -h
option, this would instead leave
.Pa foo
pointing to
.Pa bar
and inside
.Pa foo
create a new symlink
.Pa baz
pointing to itself.
This results from directory-walking.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr link 2 ,
.Xr lstat 2 ,
.Xr readlink 2 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr symlink 2 ,
.Xr symlink 7
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm
utility appeared in
.At v3 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Since the
.Ar source_file
must have its link count incremented, a hard link cannot be created to a
file which is flagged immutable or append-only (see
.Xr chflags 1 ) .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

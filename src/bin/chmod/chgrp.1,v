.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chgrp
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl h
.Ar group
.Ar file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the group ID of the specified files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.It Fl f
The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and doesn't
query about strange modes (unless the user does not have proper permissions).
.It Fl h
Change the group ID of the specified symbolic link.
The
.Fl h
and
.Fl R
options are mutually exclusive.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
operand can be either a group name from the group database,
or a numeric group ID.
If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a
group name.
.Pp
The user invoking
.Nm
must belong to the specified group and be the owner of the file,
or be the superuser.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/group -compact
.It Pa /etc/group
group ID file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr symlink 7 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compatible.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

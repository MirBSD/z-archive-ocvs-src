.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chflags
.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chflags
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | Fl L | Fl P
.Oc
.Ar flags
.Ar file Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
The
.Ar flags
of a file dictate special restrictions beyond those enforced by its
mode/permissions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl R
Recursively descend through any specified directory arguments.
Change the flags of the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is also specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is also specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is also specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.El
.Pp
Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
arch	set the archived flag
opaque	set the opaque flag (owner or superuser only)
nodump	set the nodump flag (owner or superuser only)
sappnd	set the system append-only flag (superuser only)
schg	set the system immutable flag (superuser only)
uappnd	set the user append-only flag (owner or superuser only)
uchg	set the user immutable flag (owner or superuser only)
.Ed
.Pp
An immutable file may not be changed, moved, or deleted.
An append-only file is immutable except that data may be appended to it.
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Dq no
before a flag name causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
nouchg	the immutable bit should be cleared
.Ed
.Pp
The
superuser-settable
.Dq sappnd
and
.Dq schg
flags can be set at any time, but may only be cleared when the system is
running at security level 0 or -1 (insecure or permanently insecure mode,
respectively).
The securelevel is normally set to 0, for example, when
running in single-user mode.
.Pp
Symbolic links do not have flags, so unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is set,
.Nm
on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
Only the superuser can change the user flags on block and
character devices.
.Pp
You can use
.Ic ls -lo
to see the flags of existing files.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ls 1 ,
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
.Xr fts 3 ,
.Xr symlink 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@	Bugs and Limitations
	1/99

1. Some of the makefile targets are not yet working.  Those known to
   work include all, uninstall,ksh, config.h, makefile,
   debugtools (only check-fd and check-sigs.), test, clean, & distclean.
   You need to run ksh Bugs ksh, or sh Bugs sh as appropriate.

2. You cannot start a full screen session from the windowed ksh command line.

3. Job control is not working and may never work in os/2 (no sigstp,
   sigcont, etc).

4. ls [B]* fails even when a file Bozo exists.  ls [b]* will work
   due to case folding.  The bug is in the way case folding is managed.
   ls b* or ls B* will work as expected.

5. regress.t:regression-13 test fails.  I do not understand why it can
   work on *nix.  In fact cat does not get SIGPIPE, but gets write failure.

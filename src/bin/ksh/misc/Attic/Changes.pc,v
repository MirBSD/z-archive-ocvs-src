@Changes by Peter Collinson - Hillside Systems/BSDI - July 1992


a)	Add select command - this cannot be ksh without that.
	(It NEEDS typedefs too)
b)	Remove all the bcopys from vi.c
	add 
	#define memmove in sh.h for BSD systems
c)	Add <Esc>* command to vi mode - expands to a list of files
	using the menu printing routine
d)	Add my version of history, that works much like the `proper' ksh
	storing data in a file that is shared between different invocations
	of the shell.
e)	Add the ability to redirect to am expansion... ie

		ls > o*
	if o* is unique then it puts it into the file that matches
	otherwise it puts it to a file called o*... this is current
	behaviour.
f)	Add alternations, from Csh.d) This is not part of ksh but is something
	that csh users really miss from the Bourne shell derivatives. The idea
	is that lists inside curly braces expand to arguments. ie.
		exampl{a,b,c,d,e}
	will expand to 5 arguments
		exampla examplb examplc exampld example
	Recursive lists are permitted.
g)	Add suspend as a built-in alias.
h)	Port to BSD/386 - add _POSIX_TERM and _BSDI as defines.

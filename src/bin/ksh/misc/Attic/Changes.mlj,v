@I got the pd-ksh from John MacMillan after he indicated that he
had a version of it that had vi editing (I'd seen various versions
with emacs-editing, but none with vi).

It had a few bugs and areas which were not quite complete.  I fixed
(or at least tried) to fix several; there are still some things
which I plan on doing (or at least looking into).

Bugs fixed (or at least abated):

    vi-mode changes:
    - Changed memcpy() to memmove(), which fixed the trashing of
      the end of the edit buffer while inserting in the middle
      of a line or with use of '#'
    - using 'r' replacing the current character with ^@@
    - typing ctrl-c resulting in next command being garbled
    - lack of support for '-' and '+' (pretty trivial)
    - finish adding support for '*' (not entirely sure I'm freeing
      malloc'ed memory correctly here, but I haven't had any problems)
    - treats '_' as end of a word

    general changes:
    - reporting "not found" when a file actually doesn't have
      the appropriate execute bit set (now says "cannot execute"
      or "not found", as appropriate)


Still to do:

    vi changes:
    - fix ctrl-r (I've come up with a hack, but it involves
      redrawing the screen a lot when it isn't necessary; I
      really wouldn't consider this a fix)
    - add support for 'v'

    general changes:
    - seems to be a memory leak when executing shells in the
      current shell; repeatedly executing ". /etc/profile"
      increased the size of the program as reported in the
      "SZ" field of "ps -l"
    - don't give a file its complete pathname in argv[0]; only
      its filename (religious issue?)
    - history recall should start at the previous command, not
      the current one (typing "r r" causes an infinite loop)

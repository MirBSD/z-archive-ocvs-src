#   POSIX:
#	- if no -r, \ is escape character
#	    - \newline disappear
#	    - \<IFS> -> don't break here
#	    - \<anything-else> -> <anything-else>
#	- if -r, backslash is not special
#	- if stdin is tty and shell interactive

#	- check field splitting
#	- left over fields and their separators assigned to last var

This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

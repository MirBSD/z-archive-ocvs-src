# NAME:
#	sys_config.sh - set system specific variables
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#	. /etc/sys_config.sh
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Source this script into shell scripts that want to handle
#	various system types.
#	You may well want to edit this on a particular system replacing 
#	`uname -s` etc with the result.  So that the facility will work 
#	even when in single user mode and uname et al are not available.
#
# SEE ALSO:
#	/etc/profile

.Sh NAME
.Nm rcp
.Nd remote file copy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rcp
.Op Fl Kpx
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Ar file1 file2
.Nm rcp
.Op Fl Kprx
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Ar file ...
.Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies files between machines.
Each
.Ar file
or
.Ar directory
argument is either a remote file name of the
form
.Dq rname@@rhost:path ,
or a local file name (containing no
.Ql \&:
characters,
or a
.Ql /
before any
.Br
.Ql \&:
characters).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl K
Turns off all Kerberos authentication.
.It Fl k Ar realm
Requests
.Nm
to obtain tickets
for the remote host in realm
.Ar realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
.Xr krb_realmofhost 3 .
.It Fl p
Causes
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask 2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.It Fl x
Turns on
.Tn DES
encryption for all data passed by
.Nm rcp .
This may impact response time and
.Tn CPU
utilization, but provides
increased security.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to
the login directory of the specified user
.Ar ruser
on
.Ar rhost ,
or your current user name if no other remote user name is specified.
A
.Ar path
on a remote host may be quoted (using \e, ", or \(aa)
so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.
.Pp
.Nm
does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution
via
.Xr rsh 1 ,
and requires the same authorization.
.Pp
.Nm
handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files
are on the current machine.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The version of
.Nm
described here
has been reimplemented with Kerberos in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Sh BUGS
Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might
be a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.
.Pp
Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.Pa \&.login ,
.Pa \&.profile ,
or
.Pa \&.cshrc
file on the remote host.
.Pp
The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
.Dq rhost.rname
when the destination machine is running the
.Bx 4.2
version of
.Nm rcp .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

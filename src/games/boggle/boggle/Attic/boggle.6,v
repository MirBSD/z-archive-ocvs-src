.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm boggle
.Op Fl bd
.Op Fl s Ar seed
.Op Fl t Ar time
.Op Fl w Ar length
.Op Ar + Ns Op Ar +
.Op Ar boardspec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The object of
.Nm
is to find as many words as possible on the Boggle board within the three
minute time limit.
A Boggle board is a four by four arrangement of Boggle cubes, each side of
each cube displaying a letter of the alphabet or
.Sq qu .
Words are formed by finding a sequence of cubes (letters) that are in the
game's dictionary.
The (N+1)th cube in the word must be horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the Nth cube.
Cubes cannot be reused.
Words consist solely of lower case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.
.Pp
Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the game:
.Bl -tag -width boardspec
.It Fl b
Run
.Nm
in batch mode.
A
.Ar boardspec
must also be given.
The dictionary is read from stdin and a list of words appearing in
.Ar boardspec
is printed to stdout.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging output.
.It Fl s Ar seed
Prime the random number generator with
.Ar seed
instead of data from
.Pa /dev/arandom .
.It Fl t Ar time
Change the time limit for each game from the default 3 minutes to
.Ar time
seconds.
.It Fl w Ar length
Change the minimum word length from 3 letters to
.Ar length .
.It Ar +
Allow a cube to be used multiple times, but not in succession.
.It Ar ++
Allow a cube to be considered adjacent to itself.
.El
.Pp
A starting board position,
.Ar boardspec ,
can be specified on the command line by
listing the board left to right and top to bottom, in lower case.
.Pp
Help is available during play by typing
.Sq ? .
More detailed information on the game is given there.
.Sh FILES

.Sh BUGS
If there are a great many words in the cube, the final display of the words
may scroll off the screen.
.Po
On a 25 line screen about 130 words can be displayed.
.Pc
.Pp
No word can contain a
.Sq q
that is not immediately followed by a
.Sq u .
.Pp
When using the
.Ar +
or
.Ar ++
options the display of words found in the board doesn't clearly indicate
reused cubes.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Hackathon Moose (or other Ex-Magnificent-Forest-Creature) Barbecue

30 cups oil
15 cups Soy sauce
5 cups Worcestershire Sauce
40 tsp dry mustard
20 tsp black pepper
10 cups lemon juice
10 cups white vinegar
80 cloves crushed garlic

about 75 pounds of boneless meat (moose, deer, elk, beef - try chicken
too).  For reference this is roughly an entire large dressed (Alberta
size) whitetail deer, with some moose and beef thrown in for good
measure. I've never tried finding enough chickens for a hackathon.

Mix all of the above together, and marinate meat for a few hours
before grilling. dribble marinade over meat while grilling.  Also
works well with vegetables on the grill, or meat and vegetable
kebabs. The above proportions will require about 50 bell peppers and
25 large onions to make decent kebabs (for a large family meal, divide
everything by about 20, and leave out the drunk Germans providing the
ambience while you grill)

Hackathon Raisin Rice

20 cups rice
10 Onions, chopped fine
20 cloves garlic, crushed
Butter
5 cups raisins
5 tsp oregano
45 cups water
80 chicken bouillon cubes (or equivalent - you want to make double 
			  strength chicken stock - chicken-in-a-mug
			  works well made double strength).

Saute Rice, onion and garlic in a little butter until slightly brown.
I manage this in the (large) pot(s) necessary by throwing together
the onion, garlic, and butter to brown up, then faking it a bit with
the dry rice thrown in while threatening kitchen interlopers with
sharp instruments if they come in to ask how it's going.
Dissolve bouillon in water, add along with remaining ingredients.
Cook until rice is done. (for more intimate proportions, divide down
to an appropriate amount of rice for your occasion).

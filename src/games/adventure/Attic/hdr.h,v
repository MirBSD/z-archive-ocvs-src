/*   ADVENTURE -- Jim Gillogly, Jul 1977
 * This program is a re-write of ADVENT, written in FORTRAN mostly by
 * Don Woods of SAIL.  In most places it is as nearly identical to the
 * original as possible given the language and word-size differences.
 * A few places, such as the message arrays and travel arrays were changed
 * to reflect the smaller core size and word size.  The labels of the
 * original are reflected in this version, so that the comments of the
 * fortran are still applicable here.
 *
 * The data file distributed with the fortran source is assumed to be called
 * "glorkz" in the directory where the program is first run.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

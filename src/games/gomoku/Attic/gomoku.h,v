/*
 * A 'frame' is a group of five or six contiguous board locations.
 * An open ended frame is one with spaces on both ends; otherwise, its closed.
 * A 'combo' is a group of intersecting frames and consists of two numbers:
 * 'A' is the number of moves to make the combo non-blockable.
 * 'B' is the minimum number of moves needed to win once it can't be blocked.
 * A 'force' is a combo that is one move away from being non-blockable
 *
 * Single frame combo values:
 *     <A,B>	board values
 *	5,0	. . . . . O
 *	4,1	. . . . . .
 *	4,0	. . . . X O
 *	3,1	. . . . X .
 *	3,0	. . . X X O
 *	2,1	. . . X X .
 *	2,0	. . X X X O
 *	1,1	. . X X X .
 *	1,0	. X X X X O
 *	0,1	. X X X X .
 *	0,0	X X X X X O
 *
 * The rule for combining two combos (<A1,B1> <A2,B2>)
 * with V valid intersection points, is:
 *	A' = A1 + A2 - 2 - V
 *	B' = MIN(A1 + B1 - 1, A2 + B2 - 1)
 * Each time a frame is added to the combo, the number of moves to complete
 * the force is the number of moves needed to 'fill' the frame plus one at
 * the intersection point. The number of moves to win is the number of moves
 * to complete the best frame minus the last move to complete the force.
 * Note that it doesn't make sense to combine a <1,x> with anything since
 * it is already a force. Also, the frames have to be independent so a
 * single move doesn't affect more than one frame making up the combo.
 *
 * Rules for comparing which of two combos (<A1,B1> <A2,B2>) is better:
 * Both the same color:
 *	<A',B'> = (A1 < A2 || A1 == A2 && B1 <= B2) ? <A1,B1> : <A2,B2>
 *	We want to complete the force first, then the combo with the
 *	fewest moves to win.
 * Different colors, <A1,B1> is the combo for the player with the next move:
 *	<A',B'> = A2 <= 1 && (A1 > 1 || A2 + B2 < A1 + B1) ? <A2,B2> : <A1,B1>
 *	We want to block only if we have to (i.e., if they are one move away
 *	from completing a force and we don't have a force that we can
 *	complete which takes fewer or the same number of moves to win).

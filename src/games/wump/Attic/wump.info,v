@Welcome to the game of Hunt the Wumpus. 

The Wumpus typically lives in a cave of twenty rooms, where each room 
is connected by three tunnels to the other rooms in the cavern.  Caves 
may vary, however, depending on options specified when starting the game.
The cave may contain one-way passages.

The game has the following hazards for intrepid adventurers to wend their
way through:

  Pits   -- If you fall into one of the bottomless pits, you find yourself
	    slung back out on the far side of the Earth and in very poor
	    shape to continue your quest since you're dead.

  Bats   -- As with any other cave, the Wumpus cave has bats in residence.
	    These are a bit more potent, however, and if you stumble into
	    one of their rooms they will rush up and carry you elsewhere in
	    the cave.
  
  Wumpus -- If you happen to walk into the room the Wumpus is in you'll find
	    that he has quite an appetite for young adventurous humans!  Not
	    recommended.

The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since he has sucker
feet and is too big for the bats to lift.  If you try to shoot him and miss,
there's also a chance that he'll up and move himself into another room,
though by nature the Wumpus is a sedentary creature.

Each turn you may either move or shoot a crooked arrow.  Moving is done
simply by specifying "m" for move and the number of the room that you'd
like to move down a tunnel towards.  Shooting is done similarly; indicate
that you'd like to shoot one of your magic arrows with an "s" for shoot,
then list a set of connected room numbers through which the deadly shaft
should fly!

If a tunnel does not exist between two consecutive rooms in the arrow's
path, the arrow will flail about and randomly pick an existing tunnel
to continue through.  You might just end up shooting yourself in the
foot if you're not careful!  On the other hand, if you shoot the Wumpus 
you've WON!

Good luck.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

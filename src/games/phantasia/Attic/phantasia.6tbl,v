.Sh NAME
.Nm phantasia
.Nd an interterminal fantasy game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abHmpSsx
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a role-playing game that allows players to roll up characters of
various types to fight monsters and other players.
Progression of characters is based upon gaining experience from fighting
monsters (and other players).
.Pp
Most of the game is menu-driven and self-explanatory (more or less).
.\" The screen is cursor updated, so be sure to set up the
.\" .Ev TERM
.\" variable in your environment.
.Pp
The options provide for a variety of functions to support the game.
They are:
.Bl -tag -width aaa -offset indent
.It Fl a
Get a listing of all character names on file.
.It Fl b
Show scoreboard of top characters per login.
.It Fl H
Print header only.
.It Fl m
Get a monster listing.
.It Fl p
Purge old characters.
.It Fl S
Turn on wizard options, if allowed, if running as
.Em root .
.It Fl s
Invoke
.Nm
without header information.
.It Fl x
Examine/change a particular character on file.
.El
.Pp
The characters are saved on a common file, in order to make the game
interactive between players.
Each character is given a password which allows later retrieval.
Only characters above
.Em level
zero are saved.
Characters unused for a while will be purged.
Characters are only placed on the scoreboard when they die.
.Sh PARTICULARS
.Ss Normal Play
A number of the player's more important statistics are almost always
displayed on the screen, with maximums (where applicable) in
parentheses.
.Pp
The character is placed randomly near the center of a Cartesian
system.
Most commands are selected with a single letter or digit.
For example, one may move by hitting
.Sq W ,
.Sq S ,
.Sq N ,
or
.Sq E ,
(lower case may also be used; at no time is the game case-dependent).
One may also use
.Sq H ,
.Sq J ,
.Sq K ,
and
.Sq L
for movement, as with
.Xr vi 1 .
The
.Ic move
.Pq Sq 1
command is for moving to a specific (x, y) coordinate.
The distance a character can move is calculated by
1 plus 1.5 per
.Em level .
Moving in a compass direction will move the player the maximum
allowed distance in that direction.
.Pp
A player may see who else is playing by using the
.Ic players
.Pq Sq 2
option.
One may see the coordinates of those who are the same
distance or closer to the origin as the player.
.Em Kings
and
.Em council of the wise
can see and can be seen by everyone.
A
.Em palantir
removes these restrictions.
.Pp
One can talk to other players with the
.Ic talk
.Pq Sq 3
option.
In general, this is a line or so of text.
To remove the current message, just type
.Aq return
when prompted for a message.
.Pp
The
.Ic stats
.Pq Sq 4
option shows additional characteristics of a player.
.Pp
One may leave the game with the
.Ic quit
.Pq Sq 5
option.
.Pp
One may rest by default.
Resting lets one regain maximum
.Em energy level ,
and also lets one find
.Em mana .
More mana is found at larger levels and further distances from the origin.
.Pp
One may call a monster by hitting
.Sq 9
or
.Sq C .
.Pp
.Sq X
can be used to examine other players.
.Pp
One may quit or execute a sub-shell by hitting interrupt.
Quitting during battle results in death, for obvious reasons.
.Pp
Several other options become available as the player progresses in
.Em level
and
.Em magic ,
or to other stations in the game
.Em ( valar ,
.Em council of the wise ,
.Em king ) .
These are described elsewhere.
In general, a control-L will force the redrawing of the screen.
.Pp
Other things which may happen are more or less self-explanatory.
.Ss Fighting Monsters
A player has several options while fighting monsters.
They are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width skirmish -offset indent
.It Ic melee
Inflicts damage on the monster, based upon
.Em strength .
Also decreases the monster's
.Em strength
some.
.It Ic skirmish
Inflicts a little less damage than
.Ic melee ,
but decreases the monster's
.Em quickness
instead.
.It Ic evade
Attempt to run away.
Success is based upon both the player's and the monster's
.Em brains
and
.Em quickness .
.It Ic spell
Several options for throwing spells (described elsewhere).
.It Ic nick
Hits the monster one plus the player's
.Em sword ,
and gives the player 10% of the monster's
.Em experience .
Decreases the monster's
.Em experience
an amount proportional to the amount granted.
This also increases the monster's quickness.
Paralyzed monsters wake up very fast when nicked.
.It Ic luckout
This is essentially a battle of wits with the monster.
Success is based upon the player's and the monster's
.Em brains .
The player gets credit for slaying the monster if he/she succeeds.
Otherwise, nothing happens, and the chance to
.Ic luckout
is lost.
.El
.Ss Character Statistics
.Bl -tag -width energyXlevel -offset indent
.It Em strength
determines how much damage a character can inflict.
.It Em quickness
determines how many chances a character gets to make decisions while fighting.
.It Em energy level
specifies how much damage a character may endure before dying.
.It Em magic level
determines which spells a character may throw, and how effective those
spells will be.
.It Em brains
basically, the character's intelligence; used for various fighting options
and spells.
.It Em mana
used as a power source for throwing spells.
.It Em experience
gained by fighting monsters and other characters.
.It Em level
indicative of how much experience a character has accumulated; progresses
geometrically as
.Em experience
increases.
.It Em poison
sickness which degrades a character's performance (affects
.Em energy level
and
.Em strength ) .
.It Em sin
accumulated as a character does certain nasty things; used only rarely
in normal play of the game.
.It Em age
of player; roughly equivalent to number of turns.
As
.Em age
increases, many personal statistics degenerate.
.El
.Ss Character Types
Character statistics are rolled randomly from the above list, according
to character type.
The types are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "experimento" -offset indent
.It Em magic user
strong in
.Em magic level
and
.Em brains ,
weak in other areas.
Must rely on wits and magic to survive.
.It Em fighter
good in
.Em strength
and
.Em energy level ,
fairly good in other areas.
This adds up to a well-equipped fighter.
.It Em elf
very high
.Em quickness
and above average
.Em magic level .
.It Em dwarf
very high
.Em strength
and
.Em energy level ,
but with a tendency to be rather slow and not too bright.
.It Em halfling
rather quick and smart, with high
.Em energy level ,
but poor in
.Em magic
and
.Em strength .
Born with some
.Em experience .
.It Em experimento
very mediocre in all areas.
However, the
.Em experimento
may be placed almost anywhere within the playing grid.

A monster may also be carrying

.Em gold
will slow a player down.
One may carry 1000 plus 200 per

of
.Em gold .
A
.Em gem
weighs one half a gold piece.
Monsters of treasure type 7 or higher may carry

or
.Em Dark Lords .
After a few times of using these types, the player falls
under the control of the
.Em ring ,
and strange, random things will occur.
Eventually, the player dies, and gives his/her name to a monster
on the file.
Dying before the
.Em ring
is used up also renames the monster.
.Pp
The two remaining types of
.Em rings
are much more benign.
The one from a
.Em nazgul
is good for a limited number of battle rounds, and will save
the player from death if it was being used when he/she died.
The one from
.Em Dark Lord
is the same, except that it never is used up.
.Em rings
disappear after saving someone from death.
In general, cursed
.Em rings
occur much more often than normal ones.
It is usually not a good idea to pick one up.
The only way to get rid of a
.Em ring
is to have a monster steal it.
.Ss King
A player may become
.Em king
by finding a
.Em crown
and going to (0,0).
Players must have a
.Em level
in the range of 10 to 1000 to be able to find a
.Em crown .
When a player with one or more
.Em crowns
reaches
.Em level
1000, the
.Em crowns
are converted to
.Em gold .
.Pp
Once a player is king, he/she may do certain things while in
the Lord's Chamber (0,0).
These are exercised with the
.Ic decree
('0') option.
.Bl -tag -width "collect taxes"
.It Ic transport
This is done to another player.
It randomly moves the affected player about.
A
.Em charm
protects from transports.
.It Ic curse
This is done to another player.
It is analogous to cursed treasure, but worse.
It inflicts two
.Em poison ,
knocks
.Em energy level
very low, and degrades the maximum energy.
It also removes a
.Em cloak .
A
.Em blessing
protects from king's curses.
.It Ic energy void
The king may put a number of these scattered about
his/her kingdom as he/she pleases.
If a player hits one, he/she loses
.Em mana , energy ,
and
.Em gold .
The energy void disappears after being hit.
.It Ic bestow
This is also done to another player.
The king may wish to reward one or more loyal subjects by sharing his/her
riches
.Em ( gold ) .
Or it is a convenient way to dispose of some unwanted deadweight.
.It Ic collect taxes
Everyone pays 7% tax on all
.Em gold
and
.Em gems
acquired, regardless of the existence of a
.Em king .
The king collects the accrued taxes with this option.
.El
.Pp
The
.Em king
may also
.Ic teleport
anywhere for free by using the origin as a starting place.
.Ss Council of the Wise, Valar
A player automatically becomes a member of the
.Em council of the wise
upon reaching level 3000.
Members of the council cannot have
.Em rings .
Members of the council have a few extra options which they can exercise.
These are exercised with the
.Ic intervene
.Pq Sq 8
option.
All
.Ic intervene
options cost 1000 mana.
One
.Ic intervene
option is to
.Ic heal
another player.
This is just a quick way for that player to be rested
to maximum and lose a little
.Em poison .
The main purpose in life for members of the council is to seek the
.Em Holy Grail .
This is done with a
.Em palantir
under the
.Ic seek grail
option.
The distance cited by the seek is accurate within 10%, in order
not to make it too easy to find the grail.
A player must have infinitesimally small
.Em sin ,
or else it's all over upon finding the grail.
In order to help members of the council on their quest, they
may
.Ic teleport
with greater ease.
.Pp
Upon finding the grail, the player advances to position of
.Em valar .
He/she may then exercise more and niftier options under
.Ic intervention .
These include all of the council members' options plus the
ability to move other players about, bless them, and throw monsters at
them.
A
.Em valar Ns 's
blessing has the same effect as the treasure
.Em blessing ,
except that the affected player does not get his/her
.Em blessing
flag set.
All
.Ic intervention
options which affect other players age the player who uses them.
.Em Valars
are essentially immortal, but are actually given five lives.
If these are used up, the player is left to die, and becomes an
.Em ex-valar .
A
.Em valar
cannot
.Ic move , teleport ,
or call monsters.
(An exception to this is if the
.Em valar
finds a
.Em transporter . )
This is to allow him/her to dispose of excess
.Em gold .
Any monsters which a
.Em valar
encounters are based upon his/her size.
Only one valar may exist at a time.
The current valar is replaced when another player finds the grail.
The valar is then bumped back to the council of the wise.
.Ss Wizard
The
.Em wizard
is usually the owner of the game and the one who maintains
the associated files.
The
.Em wizard
is granted special powers within the game, if it is invoked
with the
.Fl S
option.
Otherwise, the
.Em wizard
plays no different from other players.
The
.Em wizard
abilities are outlined below.
.Bl -tag -width "super character type"
.It Ic change players
When examining a player, (game invoked with
.Fl x ,
or
.Sq X
is used from within game), the
.Em wizard
may also change the player.
.It Ic intervention
The
.Em wizard
may do all the
.Ic intervention
options.
One extra option,
.Ic vaporize ,
is added to kill any offensive players.
.It Ic super character type
An extra character type is added.
This character starts with the
maximum possible in all statistics, selected from the other character types.
A
.Em super
character's statistics also progress at the maximum possible rate, selected
from the other character types.
.El
.Ss Special Places
Certain regions of the playing grid have different names.
In general, this is only to give the player some idea of
his/her present location.
Some special places do exist.
.Bl -tag -width "Trading Posts"
.It Em Trading Posts
These are located at |x| == |y| == n*n*100 for n = 1, 2, ..., 1000.
Trading posts farther out have more things for sale.
Be careful about cheating the merchants there, as they have short tempers.
Merchants are dishonest about 5% of the time.
.It Em Lord's Chamber
This is located at (0,0).
Only players with
.Em crowns
may enter.
.It Em Point of \&No Return
This is located beyond 1.2e+6 in any direction.
The only way to return from here is a
.Em transporter
or to have a
.Em valar
relocate the player.
.It Em Dead Marshes
This is a band located fairly distant from the origin.
The first fourteen monsters (water monsters) can normally only be found here.
.It Em Valhala
This place is where the
.Em valar
resides.
It is associated with no particular coordinate on the playing grid.
.El
.Ss Miscellaneous
Once a player reaches
.Em level
5, the game will start to time out waiting for input.
This is to try to keep the game a bit faster-paced.
.Pp
A
.Em guru
will never be disgusted with your
.Em sins
if they are less than one.
.Pp
A
.Em medic
wants half of a player's
.Em gold
to be happy.
Offering more than one has, or a negative amount will anger the
.Em medic ,
who will make the player worse (add one
.Em poison ) .
.Pp
The
.Em Holy Grail
does little for those who are not ready to behold it.
Whenever anyone finds it, it moves.
It is always located within 1e+6 in any compass direction of the origin.
.Pp
There is a maximum amount of
.Em mana
and
.Em charms
a player may possess, based upon
.Em level .
.Em Quicksilver
is always limited to a maximum of 99.
.Pp
.Em Books
bought at a
.Em trading post
increase
.Em brains ,
based upon the number bought.
It is unwise, however to buy more than 1/10 of one's
.Em level
in books at a time.
.Pp
Players over level 10000 are automatically retired.
.Pp
A
.Em blindness
goes away in random time.
.Pp
Players with
.Em crowns
are identified with a '*' before their character type.
.Ss Inter-terminal Battle
When two player's coordinates correspond, they may engage in battle.
In general, the player with the highest
.Em quickness
gets the first hit.
If the two players are severely mismatched, the stronger player
is drastically handicapped for the battle.
In order to protect from being stuck in an infinite loop,
the player waiting for response may time out.
Options for battle are:
.Bl -tag -width "power blast"
.It Ic fight
Inflicts damage upon other person.
.It Ic run away
Escape from battle.
Has a 75% chance of working.
.It Ic power blast
Battle spell.
.It Ic luckout
One-time chance to try to win against the foe.
Has a 10% chance of working.
.El
.Pp
Sometimes waits for the other player may be excessive, because
he/she may be battling a monster.
Upon slaying a player in battle the winner gets the other's
.Em experience
and treasures.
.Em Rings
do not work for inter-terminal battle.

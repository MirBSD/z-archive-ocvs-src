.Sh NAME
.Nm backgammon
.Nd the game of backgammon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm backgammon
.Op Fl
.Op Fl nrwb
.Op Fl s Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
or against a
.Sq friend .
All commands only are one letter,
so you don't need to type a carriage return,
except at the end of a move.
The program is mostly self documenting:
a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
If you answer
.Sq y
when the program asks if you want the rules,
you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
some hints on strategy,
instruction on how to use the program,
and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
A description of how to use the program can be
obtained by answering
.Sq y
when it asks if you want instructions.
.Pp
The possible arguments for backgammon
(most are unnecessary but some are very convenient)
consist of:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
don't ask for rules or instructions
.It Fl r
player is red (implies n)
.It Fl w
player is white (implies n)
.It Fl b
two players, red and white (implies n)
.It Fl s Ar file
recover previously saved game from
.Ar file .
.El
.Pp
.\"
An argument of
.Fl h
gets a description of possible arguments.
.Sh QUICK REFERENCE
When the program prompts by typing only your color,
type a space or carriage return to roll, or
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic d
to double
.It Ic r
to redraw the board
.It Ic q
to quit
.It Ic s
to save the game for later
.El
.Pp
When the program prompts with 'Move:', type
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic r
to redraw the board
.It Ic q
to quit
.It Ic s
to save the game
.El
.Pp
or a
.Em move ,
which is a sequence of
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic s-f
move from
.Ic s
to
.Ic f
.It Ic s/r
move one man on
.Ic s
the roll
.Ic r
separated by commas or spaces and ending with a newline.
Available abbreviations are
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXX
.It Ic s-f1-f2
means
.Ic s-f1,f1-f2
.It Ic s/r1r2
means
.Ic s/r1,s/r2
.El
.El
.Pp
Use
.Ic b
for bar and
.Ic h
for home,
or 0 or 25 as appropriate.
.Sh AUTHORS
Alan Char
.Pp
The strategy is the
.Dq pubeval
algorithm of Gerry Tesauro,
with minimal doubling logic added.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

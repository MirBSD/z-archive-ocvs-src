.Sh NAME
.Nm bs
.Nd battleships game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bs
.Op Fl b | s
.Op Fl c
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program allows you to play the familiar Battleships game against the
computer on a 10x10 board.
The interface is visual and largely self-explanatory;
you place your ships and pick your shots by moving the cursor around the
.Sq sea
with the
.Xr rogue 6
/
.Xr hack 6
motion keys
.Em hjklyubn .
.Pp
Note that when selecting a ship to place, you must type the capital letter
(these are, after all, capital ships).
During ship placement, the
.Sq r
command may be used to ignore the current position and randomly place your
currently selected ship.
The
.Sq R
command will place all remaining ships randomly.
The ^L command
.Pq form feed, ASCII 12
will force a screen redraw.
.Pp
The command-line arguments control game modes:
.Bl -tag -width XxXXX
.It Fl b
Selects a
.Sq blitz
variant.
This allows a side to shoot for as long as it continues to score hits.
.It Fl c
Permits ships to be placed adjacently.
Normally, ships must be separated by at least one square of open water.
This disables that check and allows them to close-pack.
.It Fl s
Selects a
.Sq salvo
variant.
This allows a player one shot per turn for each of his/her
ships still afloat.
This puts a premium on scoring hits early and knocking out
some ships and also makes it much harder, for example, when you face a superior
force with only your PT-boat.
.El
.Sh AUTHORS
Originally written by one Bruce Holloway in 1986.
Salvo mode added by Chuck A.  DeGaul (cbosgd!cad).
Visual user interface,
.Sq closepack
option, code rewrite
and manual page by Eric S. Raymond <esr@@snark.thyrsus.com> August 1989.
.Sh NOTES
The algorithm the computer uses once it has found a ship to sink is provably
optimal.
The dispersion criterion for the random-fire algorithm may not be.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

**  CAUSE A NOVA TO OCCUR
**
**	A nova occurs.  It is the result of having a star hit with
**	a photon torpedo.  There are several things which may happen.
**	The star may not be affected.  It may go nova.  It may turn
**	into a black hole.  Any (yummy) it may go supernova.
**
**	Stars that go nova cause stars which surround them to undergo
**	the same probabilistic process.  Klingons next to them are
**	destroyed.  And if the starship is next to it, it gets zapped.
**	If the zap is too much, it gets destroyed.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

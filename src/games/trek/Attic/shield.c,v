**  SHIELD AND CLOAKING DEVICE CONTROL

**	zero for shield control, and negative one for cloaking
**	device control.
**
**	Called with an 'up' or 'down' on the same line, it puts
**	the shields/cloak into the specified mode.  Otherwise it
**	reports to the user the current mode, and asks if she wishes
**	to change.
**
**	This is not a free move.  Hits that occur as a result of
**	this move appear as though the shields are half up/down,

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

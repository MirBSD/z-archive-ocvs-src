**  Move Klingons Around
**
**	This is a largely incomprehensible block of code that moves
**	Klingons around in a quadrant.  It was written in a very
**	"program as you go" fashion, and is a prime candidate for
**	rewriting.
**
**	The flag `fl' is zero before an attack, one after an attack,
**	and two if you are leaving a quadrant.  This serves to
**	change the probability and distance that it moves.
**
**	Basically, what it will try to do is to move a certain number
**	of steps either toward you or away from you.  It will avoid
**	stars whenever possible.  Nextx and nexty are the next
**	sector to move to on a per-Klingon basis; they are roughly
**	equivalent to Ship.sectx and Ship.secty for the starship.  Lookx and
**	looky are the sector that you are going to look at to see
**	if you can move their.  Dx and dy are the increment.  Fudgex
**	and fudgey are the things you change around to change your
**	course around stars.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

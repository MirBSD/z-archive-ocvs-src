**  CAUSE SUPERNOVA TO OCCUR
**
**	A supernova occurs.  If 'ix' < 0, a random quadrant is chosen;
**	otherwise, the current quadrant is taken, and (ix, iy) give
**	the sector quadrants of the star which is blowing up.
**
**	If the supernova turns out to be in the quadrant you are in,
**	you go into "emergency override mode", which tries to get you
**	out of the quadrant as fast as possible.  However, if you
**	don't have enough fuel, or if you by chance run into something,
**	or some such thing, you blow up anyway.  Oh yeh, if you are
**	within two sectors of the star, there is nothing that can
**	be done for you.
**
**	When a star has gone supernova, the quadrant becomes uninhab-
**	itable for the rest of eternity, i.e., the game.  If you ever
**	try stopping in such a quadrant, you will go into emergency
**	override mode.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

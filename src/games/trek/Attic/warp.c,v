**  MOVE UNDER WARP POWER
**
**	This is both the "move" and the "ram" commands, differing
**	only in the flag 'fl'.  It is also used for automatic
**	emergency override mode, when 'fl' is < 0 and 'c' and 'd'
**	are the course and distance to be moved.  If 'fl' >= 0,
**	the course and distance are asked of the captain.
**
**	The guts of this routine are in the routine move(), which
**	is shared with impulse().  Also, the working part of this
**	routine is very small; the rest is to handle the slight chance
**	that you may be moving at some riduculous speed.  In that
**	case, there is code to handle time warps, etc.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

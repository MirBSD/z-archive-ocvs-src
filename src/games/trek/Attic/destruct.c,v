**  Self Destruct Sequence
**
**	The computer starts up the self destruct sequence.  Obviously,
**	if the computer is out nothing can happen.  You get a countdown
**	and a request for password.  This must match the password that
**	you entered at the start of the game.
**
**	You get to destroy things when you blow up; hence, it is
**	possible to win the game by destructing if you take the last
**	Klingon with you.
**
**	There used to be a \032 in the message (^Z), which is because
**	the terminal in Allman's office was an ADM-3, which uses that char-
**	acter to clear the screen.  There was also a \014 (form feed)
**	because that clears some other screens.  Now there is nothing.
**	Presumably the most general screen clear today would be

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

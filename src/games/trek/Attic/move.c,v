**  Move Under Warp or Impulse Power
**
**	`Ramflag' is set if we are to be allowed to ram stars,
**	Klingons, etc.  This is passed from warp(), which gets it from
**	either play() or ram().  Course is the course (0 -> 360) at
**	which we want to move.  `Speed' is the speed we
**	want to go, and `time' is the expected time.  It
**	can get cut short if a long range tractor beam is to occur.  We
**	cut short the move so that the user doesn't get docked time and
**	energy for distance which he didn't travel.
**
**	We check the course through the current quadrant to see that he
**	doesn't run into anything.  After that, though, space sort of
**	bends around him.  Note that this puts us in the awkward posi-
**	tion of being able to be dropped into a sector which is com-
**	pletely surrounded by stars.  Oh Well.
**
**	If the SINS (Space Inertial Navigation System) is out, we ran-
**	domize the course accordingly before ever starting to move.
**	We will still move in a straight line.
**
**	Note that if your computer is out, you ram things anyway.  In
**	other words, if your computer and sins are both out, you're in
**	potentially very bad shape.
**
**	Klingons get a chance to zap you as you leave the quadrant.
**	By the way, they also try to follow you (heh heh).
**
**	Return value is the actual amount of time used.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

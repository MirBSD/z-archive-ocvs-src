.Nd Exploring The Dungeons of Doom
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rogue
.Op Fl s
.Op Ar save_file
.\" .Op Fl r
.\" .Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a computer fantasy game with a new twist.
It is crt oriented and the
object of the game is to survive the attacks of various monsters and get
a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation of most computer
fantasy games.
.Pp
To get started you really only need to know two commands.
The command
.Ic \&?
will give you a list of the available commands and the command
.Ic \&/
will identify the things you see on the screen.
.Pp
To win the game
.Po
as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high scores
.Pc
you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere below
the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out.
Nobody has achieved this
yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in history as a hero
among heroes.
.Pp
When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you
.Pq by some miracle
manage to win,
.Nm
will give you a list of the top-ten scorers.
The scoring is based entirely upon how much gold you get.
There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.
.Pp
If
.Ar save_file
is specified,
rogue will be restored from the specified saved game file.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option will print out the list of scores.
.Pp

Probably infinite, although none are known.
However,
that Ice Monsters sometimes transfix you permanently is

It's a feature.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

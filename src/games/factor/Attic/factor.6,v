.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm factor ,
.Nm primes
.Nd factor a number, generate primes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm factor
.Op Ar number ...
.Nm primes
.Op Ar start Op Ar stop
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will factor 64-bit positive integers.
When a number is factored, it is printed, followed by a
.Dq \&: ,
and the list of factors on a single line.
Factors are listed in ascending order, and are preceded by a space.
If a factor divides a value more than once, it will be printed
more than once.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with one or more arguments,
each argument will be factored.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with no arguments,
.Nm
reads numbers, one per line, from standard input, until end of file or error.
White-space and empty lines are ignored.
Numbers may be preceded by a single +.
After a number is read, it is factored.
Input lines must not be longer than 99 characters.
.Pp
The
.Nm primes
utility prints primes in ascending order, one per line, starting at or above
.Ar start
and continuing until, but not including
.Ar stop .
The
.Ar start
value must be at least 0 and not greater than
.Ar stop .
The
.Ar stop
value must not be greater than 4294967295.
The default value of
.Ar stop
is 4294967295.
.Pp
When the
.Nm primes
utility is invoked with no arguments,
.Ar start
is read from standard input.
.Ar stop
is taken to be 4294967295.
The
.Ar start
value may be preceded by a single +.
The input line must not be longer than 99 characters.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm factor
cannot handle the
.Dq 10 most wanted
factor list;
.Nm primes
won't get you a world record.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

/***** unido:net.games.hack / ab /  7:23 pm  Sep 13, 1985*/

Recently hack (1.0.3) crashed with core dumps during some good games.
The crashes occurred in the onbill-routine. After investigating the core
dump I found that the shopkeeper's bill was still to be paid.  Normaly
if you leave a shop the bill will be cleared and onbill() would not
check it. But under certain conditions you can leave a shop without
clearing the bill. The conditions are:

     1. You have to rob a shop in order to make the shopkeeper
	follow you.

     2. After leaving the shop being followed by the shopkeeper
	you must return to the shop...

     3. ...and then leave the unguarded shop again.
	- The shopkeeper mustn't be present!

If you climb the stairs to the previous level, chances are that your
bill now contains much more items than allowed. If so the next call to
onbill() will dump the core.

Following is a context diff to fix the bug. Actually just the last hunk
does the fix [it deletes two lines which have been inserted in 1.0.3],
but I think the other fix was intended by the now deleted lines.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

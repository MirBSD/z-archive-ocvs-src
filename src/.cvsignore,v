@like a week of hard work.
* .cvsignore: add build.log
* X: remove unused code
* distrib: shrink floppy ramdisk until it fits, factor out some
  essentials (ping, netcat, hexdump, df, mknod, update, MBRmgr)
  into just another list
* disktab, conf/FLOPPY: in-kernel floppy image shrinks by 256 KiB
* distrib/lists: sync
* gcc: Ada now always disables -fstack-protector-all (not SSP in
  general); I learned it protects by itself
* ld.so, sed: gcc -fstack-protector-all mis-compiles some files
* bsd.own.mk: libbfd and libopcodes need a minor bump
* sys.mk, param.h, gcc version.c: bump MirOS version/patchlevel

I *hope* a make b-r "could" now succeed. I've done like 50 this week.

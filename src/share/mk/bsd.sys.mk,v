@First (probably not working[1]) attempt at modernizing the framework:
* MANZ, MANPS, NOPROFILE die (always set to false, false, true)
* Fortran generating code for <bsd.prog.mk> dies (pascal to follow)
* GLOBAL_AUTOCONF_CACHE dies (birth of <bsd.gnuwrap.mk> to follow...)
* sanitize my head and rewrite certain pieces of certain Makefiles
* move most mk.conf functionality out of there, so a system
  without mk.conf works really well(TM)
* attempt at synching docs with reality

[1] First update *.mk, then remove old mk.conf and mk.conf.local,
    then install new mk.conf and adapt it to suit your needs.

Why don't the OpenBSD people modernize parts of this? The indenting
is really really bad in places, and MANSUBDIR was... well. I have
done it with 1/3 of the code now, and it works. Even better.

There will definitively follow more ;-)

@wbx@@ you definitively owe me something.
I had the idea at work, polished it in the train back,
and it took me quite two (2) hours to get it working.

* while here, remove whitespace at end of line
* while here, change IGNORE= to IGNORE+=
* while here, print _all_ ignores on separate lines
  (taken from bsd.sys.mk)
* have ports being IGNOREd _iff_
  a) BATCH=Yes
  b) USE_CXX=Yes AND no C++ compiler installed (as usual)
  OR USE_X11=Yes AND no X-Window installed (as usual)
  OR it depends on another port, which
     - is NOT already installed
       XXX version number is checked. bad (for users, not for QA).
     - EITHER depends on C++ which is not installed
       OR depends on X-Window which is not installed
       OR both of the above
* yes, this is inherited (e.g. kde/base3 checks not only kde/libs3,
  but also its dependencies, as well as the dependencies of those).
* sync the licence between these two files

XXX please do test if nothing breaks

Yes, it's known that this increases the build time, because this
check has to be done every time (and it's recursive).
That's why it's only used if BATCH=Yes (if BATCH is not defined,
nothing should have changed at all, lest alone the allowal for
multiple IGNORE lines).

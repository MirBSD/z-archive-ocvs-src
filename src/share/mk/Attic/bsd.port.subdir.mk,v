@First (probably not working[1]) attempt at modernizing the framework:
* MANZ, MANPS, NOPROFILE die (always set to false, false, true)
* Fortran generating code for <bsd.prog.mk> dies (pascal to follow)
* GLOBAL_AUTOCONF_CACHE dies (birth of <bsd.gnuwrap.mk> to follow...)
* sanitize my head and rewrite certain pieces of certain Makefiles
* move most mk.conf functionality out of there, so a system
  without mk.conf works really well(TM)
* attempt at synching docs with reality

[1] First update *.mk, then remove old mk.conf and mk.conf.local,
    then install new mk.conf and adapt it to suit your needs.

Why don't the OpenBSD people modernize parts of this? The indenting
is really really bad in places, and MANSUBDIR was... well. I have
done it with 1/3 of the code now, and it works. Even better.

There will definitively follow more ;-)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Jumbo patch from wbx@@ to replace the
bcopy(3), bcmp(3) and bzero(3) func-
tions, having been deprecated earli-
er, by their ISO counterparts, name-
ly memmove(3) and the gcc3-optimized
memcmp(3) and memset(3) functions.

I didn't read every single line (be-
cause of the time of day), but looks
fine and builds through. I just nee-
ded to nuke three cases of whitespa-
ce at EOL. Good work wbx@@.

I've also sprinkled in a few patches
of mine addressing the issue that in
some kernel header files, bcopy() is
used as well... also there have been
quite some string cleaning fixes and
a missing header.

/*
 * mktab.c
 *
 * Function:	Build nroff terminal tables in a compiler-independent way.
 * Usage:	cc -Itroff mktab.c tabnnn.c -o mktab; mktab > tabnnn
 * Date:	Sat Feb 25 00:10:06 MST 1989
 * Author:	Donn Seeley
 * Remarks:
 *	Traditional nroff terminal table construction works by compiling
 *	a C file into a binary that is read directly into nroff as it runs.
 *	If your C compiler or your relocation format differ from what nroff
 *	expects, you lose.  This program, when linked with a terminal table
 *	object file, fakes up an 'object' file that looks enough like the
 *	traditional one to fool nroff.

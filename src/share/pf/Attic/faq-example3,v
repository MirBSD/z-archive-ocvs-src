@remove pf features which are broken:
 ($interface) -> did never work correctly
 antispoof -> dangerous, false sense of security, side impacts, only for lazies

remove kernel stuff accordingly, but don't change ABI

update documentation
remove orphaned documentation nobody maintains

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

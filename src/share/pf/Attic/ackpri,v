@remove pf features which are broken:
 ($interface) -> did never work correctly
 antispoof -> dangerous, false sense of security, side impacts, only for lazies

remove kernel stuff accordingly, but don't change ABI

update documentation
remove orphaned documentation nobody maintains

@# $OpenBSD: ackpri,v 1.2 2003/03/10 14:24:33 henning Exp $

# Use a simple priority queue to prioritize empty (no payload) TCP ACKs,
# which dramatically improves throughput on (asymmetric) links when the
# reverse direction is saturated. The empty ACKs use an insignificant
# part of the bandwidth, but if they get delayed, downloads suffer
# badly, so prioritize them.

# Example: 512/128 kbps ADSL. Download is 50 kB/s. When a concurrent
# upload saturates the uplink, download drops to 7 kB/s. With the
# priority queue below, download drops only to 48 kB/s.

# Replace lo0 with your real external interface

ext_if="lo0"

# For a 512/128 kbps ADSL with PPPoE link, using "bandwidth 100Kb"
# is optimal. Some experimentation might be needed to find the best
# value. If it's set too high, the priority queue is not effective, and
# if it's set too low, the available bandwidth is not fully used.
# A good starting point would be real_uplink_bandwidth * 90 / 100.

altq on $ext_if priq bandwidth 100Kb queue { q_pri, q_def }
queue q_pri priority 7
queue q_def priority 1 priq(default)

pass out on $ext_if proto tcp from $ext_if to any flags S/SA \
	keep state queue (q_def, q_pri)

pass in  on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if flags S/SA \
	keep state queue (q_def, q_pri)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

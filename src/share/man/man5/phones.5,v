.Sh NAME
.Nm phones
.Nd remote host phone number file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
files are used by
.Xr tip 1
to find phone numbers not included in the
.Xr remote 5
database(s) being used.
.Pp
The default file is
.Pa /etc/phones ,
which is used unless the
.Ev PHONES
environment variable has been set.
.Pa /etc/phones
is world readable by default, and should
.Em not
contain privileged information.
.Pp
The format of the file is a series of lines of the form:
.Pp
.D1 Li <system name>[\ \et]*<phone number>
.Pp
The system name must start at the first character on the line.
The phone number is any sequence of characters terminated by a
.Ql \&,
or the end of the line.
Thus the phone number field can contain arbitrary dialing strings, not
just phone numbers.
.Pp
Certain auto-call units or modems can use
.Ql \&,
in their dialing strings.
For these units (currently Hayes, Courier and Telebit)
.Xr tip 1
will translate a
.Ql \&=
in the phone number to a
.Ql \&,
when actually dialing the number.
.Pp
If the auto-call unit is a Racal-Vadic 831,
.Xr tip 1
will translate a
.Ql \&_
in the phone number to a
.Ql \&= .
.Pp
.Xr tip 1
ignores all lines with a system name other than the one being
looked up.
Comments can be inserted into the file by making the first character
on a line something not used to start any system name in the
.Xr remote 5
database(s) being used, such as 
.Ql # .
.Pp
Only one phone number per line is permitted.
To associate more than one phone number with a system name you must
create multiple lines that have the same system name.
.Xr tip 1 
will try each number in sequence until it makes a connection or
reaches the end of the file.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

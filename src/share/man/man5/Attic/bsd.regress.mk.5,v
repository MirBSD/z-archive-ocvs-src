.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.regress.mk
.Nd regression test master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.regress.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
holds the standard routines used by the source regression tests.
Some variables and targets are for its internal use only.
The rest are documented here.
.Pp
Since this file also includes
.Nm bsd.prog.mk ,
all of the usual
.Ox
Makefile variables may be used to build the regression
test programs.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width regress
.It Ar depend
Build any dependencies required to carry out the current set
of regression tests.
.It Ar regress
Executes all of the regression targets defined in the Makefile.
.It Ar run-regress-*
Runs an individual regression test.
If the exit status of the program indicates an error or timeout,
then a failure is logged, otherwise the test is marked as a success.
.El 
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width REGRESS_LOG
.It Ev REGRESS_LOG
Points to the fully-qualified path of a file to which regression
results are appended.
Defaults to
.Pa /dev/null .
.It Ev REGRESS_MAXTIME
Maximum limit of CPU seconds to spend on the regression test.
Exceeding this time will result in a failure being logged.
.It Ev REGRESS_ROOT_TARGETS
Targets for which root access is required to run the test.
The
.Ev SUDO
variable is invoked for these targets.
See also
.Ev SUDO .
.It Ev REGRESS_SKIP_SLOW
If this variable is not empty, skip over all the regression 
tests which have been marked as being 'slow' using the
.Ev REGRESS_SLOW_TARGETS
variable.
.It Ev REGRESS_SLOW_TARGETS
Targets which are defined as 'slow'.
All of these tests can be skipped by setting the 
.Ev REGRESS_SKIP_SLOW 
variable.
.It Ev REGRESS_TARGETS
Targets which are invoked to run the set of regression tests
for this Makefile.
Defaults to 
.Ar run-regress-${PROG} .
.It Ev SUDO
Location of the sudo command, used to switch to root for certain
test targets which require it.
.El
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The build system is unable to distinguish between timeouts due to 
.Ev REGRESS_MAXTIME
being exceeded, or a genuine failure occurring.
.Sh HISTORY
The regression system originally came from
.Nx ,
with many tests added by
.Ox 
since.
The current Makefile framework was written by Artur Grabowski
and Marc Espie for 
.Ox 3.1 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

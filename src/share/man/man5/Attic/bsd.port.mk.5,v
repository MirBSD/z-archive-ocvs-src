.Dt BSD.PORT.MK 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.port.mk
.Nd ports tree master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.port.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
holds all the standard routines used by the ports tree.
Some variables and targets are for its internal use only.
The rest is documented here.
.Pp
Other BSD variants, as well as older versions of
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
include other targets and variables.
Conversion methods are outlined here.
.Pp
This is still incomplete; some variables and targets are not yet documented.
Mostly because undocumented stuff has fuzzy semantics, and it hasn't been
decided yet how to define it.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It Ar addsum
Complete the ${CHECKSUM_FILE} record of checksums with files that have been
added since
.Ar makesum .
Complain if anything does not match.
.It Ar build , Ar all
Default target.
Build the port.
Essentially invoke
.Bd -literal
env -i ${MAKE_ENV} ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${MAKE_FLAGS} \\
.Ed
.Bd -literal
	-f ${MAKE_FILE} ${ALL_TARGET}
.Ed
.It Ar checkpatch
Debugging version of the
.Ar patch
target that simulates invoking
.Xr patch 1 .
.It Ar checksum
Check distribution archives and distribution patches control sum against
the results recorded in ${CHECKSUM_FILE},
using the cryptographic signature utilities listed in ${PREFERRED_CIPHERS}.
Normally ${ALLFILES}
are checksummed, unless
.Ev IGNOREFILES
is set to a list of files to ignore.
Invoking
.Ar checksum
with REFETCH=true
will try to fetch a version with the correct checksum from the
.Ox
main archive site in the case of a checksum mismatch.
.It Ar clean
Clean ports contents. 
By default, it will clean the work directory.
It can be invoked as 
make clean='[depends bulk work fake flavors dist install sub package packages]'.
.Bl -tag -width packages
.It Va work
Clean work directory.
.It Va bulk
Clean bulk cookie.
.It Va depends
Recurse into dependencies.
.It Va flavors
Clean all work directories.
.It Va dist
Clean distfiles.
.It Va install
Uninstall package.
.It Va package
Remove package file.
.It Va sub
With
.Va install
or
.Va package ,
clean subpackages as well.
.It Va packages
Short-hand for `sub package'.
.El
.It Ar configure
Configure the port.
Might be a void operation.
Unless overridden, configure creates the ${WRKBUILD}
directory (see SEPARATE_BUILD), runs ${SCRIPTDIR}/configure if it exists,
and runs whatever configuration methods are recorded in
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE .
.It Ar distpatch
Apply distribution patches only.
.It Ar do-patch
Override for the default behavior of
.Ar patch .
It is usually better to override
.Ar post-patch ,
as
.Ar patch
needs to invoke
.Ar distpatch
directly for historical reasons.
.It Ar extract
Extract the distfiles under
.Pa ${WRKDIST}
(but see
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY ) .
Refer to
.Ev EXTRACT_CASES
for a complete description.
.It Ar fake
Do a fake port installation, that is, simulate the port installation under
${WRKINST}.
Described in a separate section below.
.It Ar fetch
Fetch the distfiles and patchfiles.
Each file of the
.Ev DISTFILES
and
.Ev PATCHFILES
lists is retrieved, if necessary, from the list of sites in
.Ev MASTER_SITES .
If a filename ends with a
.Sq :0
to
.Sq :9
extension, it will be retrieved from
.Ev MASTER_SITES0
to
.Ev MASTER_SITES9
instead.
The ports framework uses
.Pa ${DISTDIR}/${DIST_SUBDIR}
(aliased to
.Pa ${FULLDISTDIR} )
to cache the ports distribution files and patch files.
Note that this framework is also used by mirroring scripts,
which will also retrieve
.Ev SUPDISTFILES ,
to fill with supplementary distribution files which are not needed for
every configuration.
See
.Ev ALLFILES ,
.Ev CDROM_SITE ,
.Ev DISTDIR ,
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR ,
.Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES ,
.Ev FULL_DISTDIR ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES0 , ... ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES9 ,
.Ev PATCH_FILES ,
.Ev SUPDISTFILES ,
.Ev REFETCH .
.It Ar lib-depends-check
Verify that the
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
hold all shared libraries used for the port.
See
.Xr library-specs 7 .
.It Ar makesum
Create the ${CHECKSUM_FILE} list of recorded checksums by running the
cryptographic fingerprints sha1, md5 and rmd160 on ${ALLFILES} minus
${IGNOREFILES}.
.It Ar manpages-check
Verify that
.Xr makewhatis 8
can do a correct job with the port's manpages.
.It Ar patch
Apply distribution and
.Ox
specific patches.
Because of historical accident,
.Ar patch
does not follow the exact same scheme other standard targets do.
Namely,
.Ar patch
invokes
.Ar pre-patch
(if defined),
.Ar do-patch ,
and
.Ar post-patch ,
but the default
.Ar do-patch
target recurses through
.Ar distpatch
So, if the
.Ar do-patch
target is overridden, it should still begin by calling
make distpatch, before applying
.Ox
specific patches.
See
.Ar distpatch
for the distribution patches-specific description.
If
.Pa ${PATCHDIR}
exists, the files described under
.Ev PATCH_LIST
will be applied under
.Ev WRKDIST .
.It Ar print-depends
Print all dependencies for the given port.
.It Ar rebuild
Force rebuild of the port.
.It Ar regress
Run regression tests for the port.
Essentially depend on a correct build and invoke
.Bd -literal
env -i ${MAKE_ENV} ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${REGRESS_FLAGS} \\
.Ed
.Bd -literal
	-f ${MAKE_FILE} ${REGRESS_TARGET}
.Ed
If a port needs some other ports installed to run regression tests,
use
.Ev REGRESS_DEPENDS .
If a port needs special configuration or build options to enable regression
testing, define a
.Sq regress
.Ev FLAVOR .
.It Ar show
Invoked as show=name, show the contents of ${name}.
Mostly used from recursive makes, or to know the contents of another
port's variables without guessing wrongly.
.It Ar update-plist
Update the packing lists for a port, using the fake installation and the
existing packing lists.
.Ar update-plist
should produce mostly correct 
.Pa PLIST ,
.Pa PFRAG.shared
and
.Pa PFRAG.no-shared
files, handling shared libraries, GNU
.Xr info 1
files, setuid files, and empty directories.
It moves existing files to
.Pa PLIST.orig, 
.Pa PFRAG.shared.orig
and
.Pa PFRAG.no-shared.orig .
If the generated lists include files and directories that shouldn't be
included, comment these like this:
.Bd -literal
@@comment unwanted-file
@@comment @@dirrm unwanted-dir
.Ed
.Pp
Subsequent calls to
.Ar update-plist
will automatically recognize and handle such lines correctly.
.Pp
.Ar update-plist
does not handle multi-packages nor flavor situations yet, so beware.
.It Ar update-patches
Create or update patches for a port, using
.Xr diff 1
between
.Pa file
and
.Pa file.orig ,
based on
.Pa file.orig
existence.
In order to generate a patch, the original file needs to be named
.Pa file.orig
and
.Pa file
edited.
After the target is invoked, the patches are placed under the
patches/ directory.
It moves existing patches from
.Pa patch-file
to
.Pa patch-file.orig
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev show
Invoked as make show=name, show the contents of variable name.
.It Ev ALLFILES
List of all files that need to be retrieved by
.Ar fetch ,
with master site selection extension removed.
Read-only.
.It Ev ALL_TARGET
Target used to build software.
Default is
.Sq all .
Can be set to empty, to yield a package's default target.
.It Ev ARCH
Current machine architecture (read-only).
.It Ev AUTOCONF
Location of the autoconf binary if needed.
Defaults to autoconf (though make autoreconf might be more appropriate).
.It Ev AUTOCONF_DIR
Where to invoke autoconf if ${CONFIGURE_STYLE} includes autoconf.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}.
.\" AUTOCONF_DIR should probably be a list, and be renamed to AUTOCONF_DIRS ?
.It Ev AUTOCONF_VERSION
Starting with
.Ox 3.3 ,
several versions of autoconf may coexist peacefully.
Setting 
.Ev AUTOCONF_VERSION 
along with
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
set to autoconf is the correct way to specify which one to use.
If autoconf must be run manually,
.Ev MODGNU_AUTOCONF_DEPENDS
can be used to specify what packages to depend upon.
.It Ev BSD_INSTALL_{PROGRAM,SCRIPT,DATA,MAN}[_DIR]
Macros passed to make and configure invocations.
Set based on corresponding INSTALL_* variables.
.It Ev BIN_PACKAGES
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
the 
.Ar package
target will trust a package built in the repository to be up-to-date,
and will not rebuild it if the work directory is absent.
See also
.Ev BULK ,
.Ev TRUST_PACKAGES .
.It Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
List of other ports the current port needs to build correctly.
Each item has the form
.Sq [legacy]:[pkgspec]:directory[,-subpackage][,flavor ...][:target] .
.Sq target
defaults to
.Sq install
if it is not specified.
.Sq legacy
used to be a file to check. 
The ports tree now uses
.Sq pkgspec
instead, as a package that must be installed prior to the build.
.Sq directory
is set relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
.Sq subpackage
is an optional subpackage name, to install instead of the default main
package name.
.Sq flavor ...
is a comma separated list of flavors.
By default, the dependency will build the default flavor.
Build dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
.Pp
Build dependencies that are not the default 
.Ar package or 
.Ar install 
target will be processed in a subdirectory of the working directory,
specifically, in ${WRKDIR}/directory.
.It Ev BULK
If set to 
.Sq Yes ,
successful package builds and installations will clean
their working directories, after invoking 
.Ar ftp-packages ,
.Ar cdrom-packages ,
and any other targets mentioned in BULK_TARGETS.
See
.Ev BULK_COOKIES_DIR ,
.Ev BIN_PACKAGES ,
.Ev TRUST_PACKAGES .
.It Ev BULK_COOKIES_DIR
Used to store cookies for successful bulk-package builds, defaults to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/bulk/${MACHINE_ARCH} .
.It Ev BULK_FLAGS
Flags to pass to build each target in
.Ev BULK_TARGETS .
.It Ev BULK_TARGETS
Targets to run after each bulk package build before cleaning up the 
working directory.
Defaults to
.Ar ftp-packages ,
.Ar cdrom-packages .
.It Ev BZIP2
Name of the bzip2 binary.
.It Ev CATEGORIES
List of descriptive categories into which this port falls.
Mandatory.
See
.Ar link-categories ,
.Ar unlink-categories .
.It Ev CDROM_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for a CDROM (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM) will be placed
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/cdrom-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev CDROM_SITE
Path to a local database that holds distribution files (usually a CD-Rom
or other similar media), used to retrieve distribution files before going
to the network.
Defaults to
.Pa /cdrom/distfiles
if this path exists.
Distribution files are still copied or linked (see
.Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISFILES )
into
.Ev DISTDIR
if they are found under CDROM_SITE.
.It Ev CFLAGS
Default flags passed to the compiler for building.
Many ports ignore it.
See also
.Ev COPTS .
.It Ev CHECKSUM_FILE
Location for this port's checksums, used by
.Ar addsum ,
.Ar checksum ,
and
.Ar makesum .
Defaults to distinfo.
.It Ev CLEANDEPENDS
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
.Sq make clean
will also clean dependencies.
Note that distclean never recurses down to dependencies.
.It Ev COMMENT
Comment used for the package, and in the INDEX.
.It Ev COMMENT-foo
Comment used for sub package foo in a multi-package set up.
.It Ev COMMENT-vanilla
Comment used for a flavored package, if the non-flavored comment is
inappropriate.
.It Ev COMMENT-foo-vanilla
Comment used for a sub-, flavored package.
.It Ev COMES_WITH
The first release where the port was made part of the standard
distribution.
If the current OpenBSD version is >= this version then a notice
will be displayed instead of the port being built.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_ARGS
Arguments to pass to configure script.
Defaults are empty, except for
gnu-style configure, where prefix and sysconfdir are set.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_ENV
Basic environment passed to configure script (path and libtool setup).
gnu-style configure adds a lot more variables.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_SCRIPT
Set to name of script invoked by
.Ar configure
target, if appropriate.
Should be relative to ${WRKSRC}.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_SHARED
Set to --enable-shared or --disable-shared, depending on whether the
architecture supports shared libraries.
Should be appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS, for ports that build dynamic libraries 
and whose configure script supports these options.
.It Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
Set to style of configuration that needs to happen.
If
.Sq perl ,
assume
.Xr perl 1
.Xr ExtUtils::MakeMaker 3p
style.
If
.Sq gnu ,
assume
gnu configure style.
Add
.Sq dest
if port does not handle DESTDIR correctly, and needs to be configured to
add DESTDIR to prefixes
.Po
see also
.Ev DESTDIRNAME 
.Pc .
Add
.Sq old
if port is an older autoconf port that does not recognize --sysconfdir.
Add
.Sq autoconf
if autoconf needs to be rerun first.
Add
.Sq automake
if automake may need to be rerun.
Otherwise, automake will be explicitly disabled.
If
.Sq imake ,
assume port configures using X11 ports Imakefile framework.
Add
.Sq noman
if port has no man pages the Imakefile should try installing.
If
.Sq simple ,
there is a configure script, but it does not fit the normal gnu configure
conventions.
.It Ev MODGNU_CONFIG_GUESS_DIRS
If a port uses config.guess outside WRKSRC, the directories
containing the other copies must be set here.
.It Ev COPTS
Supplementary options appended to ${CFLAGS} for building.
Since most ports ignore the COPTS convention, they are actually told to use
${CFLAGS} ${COPTS} as CFLAGS.
.It Ev CXXOPTS
Supplementary options appended to ${CXXFLAGS} for building.
.It Ev DEF_UMASK
Correct value of umask for the port to build and package correctly.
Tested against the actual umask at
.Ar fake
time.
Default is 022.
Don't override.
.It Ev DESTDIRNAME
Name of variable to set to ${WRKINST} while faking.
Usually DESTDIR.
To be used in the rare cases where a port heeds DESTDIR in a few
directories and needs to be configured with 
.Sq gnu dest ,
so that those few directories do not get in the way.
.It Ev DISTDIR
Directory where all ports distfiles and patchfiles are stashed.
Defaults to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/distfiles.
Override if distfiles are stored elsewhere.
Always use
.Ev FULLDISTDIR
to refer to ports' distfiles location, as it takes an eventual
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR
into account.
.It Ev DISTFILES
The main port's distribution files (the actual software source, except
for binary-only ports).
Will be retrieved from the MASTER_SITES (see
.Ar fetch ) ,
checksummed and extracted (see
.Ar checksum ,
.Ar extract ) .
.Ev DISTFILES
normally holds a list of files, possibly with
.Sq :0
to
.Sq :9
appended to select a different
.Ev MASTER_SITES .
See also
.Ev SUPDISTFILES .
.It Ev DISTNAME
Name used to identify the port.
See
.Ev DISTFILES
and
.Ev PKGNAME .
.It Ev DISTORIG
Suffix used by
.Ar distpatch
to rename original files.
Defaults to
.Pa .bak.orig .
Distinct from
.Pa .orig
to avoid confusing
.Ar update-patches .
.It Ev DIST_SUBDIR
Optional subdirectory of ${DISTDIR} where the current port's distfiles
and patchfiles will be located.
See target
.Ar fetch.
.It Ev ECHO_MSG
Used to display
.Sq ===> Configuring for foo
and similar informative messages.
Override to turn off, for instance.
.It Ev ERRORS
List of errors found while parsing the port's Makefile.
Display the errors before making any target, and if any error starts with
.Qq Fatal: ,
do not make anything.
For instance:
.Bd -literal -indent
\&.if !defined(COMMENT)
ERRORS+="Fatal: Missing comment"
\&.endif
.Ed
.It Ev EXTRACT_CASES
In the normal extraction stage (when
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY
is not empty), this is the contents of a case statement, used to extract files.
Fragments are automatically appended to extract tar and zip
archives, so that the default case is equivalent to the following shell
fragment:
.Bd -literal -indent
set -e
cd ${WRKDIR}
for archive in ${EXTRACT_ONLY}
do
    case $$archive in
	*.zip)
	  unzip -q ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive -d ${WRKDIR};;
	*.tar.bz2)
	  bzip2 -dc ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive| tar xf -;;
	*.shar.gz|*.shar.Z|*.sh.Z|*.sh.gz)
	  gzcat ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive | /bin/sh;;
	*.shar|*.sh)
	  /bin/sh ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive;;
	*.tar)
	  tar xf ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive;;
	*)
	  gzip -dc ${FULLDISTDIR}/$$archive | tar xf -;;
    esac
done
.Ed
.It Ev EXTRACT_ONLY
Set if not all ${DISTFILES} should be extracted at do-extract stage.
Default value is ${DISTFILES}.
.It Ev EXTRACT_SUFX
Used to set DISTFILES default value to ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}.
Default value is .tar.gz.
.It Ev FAKE
Automatically set to
.Sq Yes
for most ports (and all new ports).
Indicates that the port, using
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS
magic, will properly fake installation into ${WRKINST}, to be packaged
and properly installed from the package.
Set to
.Sq No
in very rare cases, and during port creation.
.It Ev FAKE_FLAGS
Flags passed to ${MAKE_PROGRAM} on fake invocation.
By default, ${DESTDIRNAME}=${WRKINST}.
.It Ev FETCH_CMD
Command used to fetch distfiles for this port.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/bin/ftp .
No current port overrides the default.
.It Ev FETCH_DEPENDS
See BUILD_DEPENDS for specification.
Fetch dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
.It Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES
Set to
.Sq Yes
to link distribution files off
.Ev CDROM_SITE
instead of copying them.
.It Ev FILESDIR
Location of other files related to the current ports.
Holds at least the checksum file, sometimes other files
(default: files.${ARCH} or files).
.It Ev FLAVOR
The port's current options.
Set by the user, and tested by the port to activate wanted functionalities.
.It Ev FLAVORS
List of all flavors keywords a port may match.
Used to sort FLAVOR into a canonical order to build the package name,
or to select the packing-list, and as a quick validity check.
See also
.Ev PSEUDO_FLAVORS .
.It Ev FLAVOR_EXT
Canonical list of flavors being set for the current build, dash-separated.
See
.Ev FULLPKGNAME .
.It Ev FTP_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for ftp (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP) will be placed
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/ftp-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev FULLPKGNAME
Full name of the main created package, taking flavors into account.
Defaults to ${PKGNAME}${FLAVOR_EXT}.
.It Ev FULLPKGNAME-foo
Full package name for sub-package foo, if the default value is not
appropriate.
.It Ev GMAKE
Location of the gnu make binary, if needed.
Defaults to gmake.
.It Ev IGNOREFILES
Set to the list of files that cannot be checksummed.
For use by ports which
fetch dynamically generated archives that can't be checksummed.
.It Ev LIB_DEPENDS
Libraries this port depends upon.
Each item has the form
.Sq lib_specs:[pkgspec]:directory[,-subpackage][,flavor ...][:target] .
Similar to BUILD_DEPENDS, except for
.Sq lib_specs ,
which is a comma-separated list of
.Sq lib_spec
of the form:
.Sq libname.[version.[subversion]] .
See 
.Xr library-specs 7
for more details.
.Pp
On architectures that use dynamic libraries,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
is also used as a run-time dependency, and recorded in the package as
such.
.It Ev FULLDISTDIR
Complete path to directory where ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES} will be
located, to be used in hand-crafted extraction targets (read-only).
.It Ev IGNORE
The port is ignored if set to
.Sq Yes .
.It Ev INSTALL_{PROGRAM,SCRIPT,DATA,MAN}[_DIR]
Macros to use to install a program, a script, a man page, or data (or the
corresponding directory, respectively).
.It Ev INSTALL_TARGET
Target invoked to install the software, during fake installation.
Default is
.Sq install .
.It Ev IS_INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port needs human interaction to build.
Usually implies NO_PACKAGE as well.
Porters should strive to minimize IS_INTERACTIVE ports, by using
FLAVORS for multiple choice ports, and by postponing human intervention
to package installation time.
.It Ev LIBTOOL
Location of the libtool binary for ports that set
.Ev USE_LIBTOOL
(default: ${LOCALBASE}/bin/libtool).
.It Ev LIBTOOL_FLAGS
Arguments to pass to libtool.
If USE_LIBTOOL is set, the environment variable LIBTOOL is set
to ${LIBTOOL} ${LIBTOOL_FLAGS}.
.It Ev LOCALBASE
where other ports have already been installed (default: /usr/local)
.It Ev MAINTAINER
E-mail address with full name of the port's maintainer.
Defaults to ports@@openbsd.org.
.It Ev MAKE_ENV
Environment variables passed to make invocations.
Sets at least PATH, PREFIX, LOCALBASE, X11BASE, CFLAGS, TRUEPREFIX, DESTDIR,
and the BSD_INSTALL_* macros.
.It Ev MAKE_FLAGS
Flags used for all make invocations, except for the 
.Ar fake 
stage, which uses
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS ,
and for the regress stage, which uses 
.Ev REGRESS_FLAGS .
.It Ev MAKE_FILE
Name of the Makefile used for ports building.
Defaults to Makefile.
Used after changing directory to ${WRKBUILD}.
.It Ev MAKE_PROGRAM
The make program that is used for building the port.
Set to ${MAKE} or ${GMAKE} depending on USE_GMAKE.
Read-only.
.It Ev MESSAGE

.It Ev MTREE_FILE
.Xr mtree 8
specification to check when creating a PLIST with the
.Ar plist
target.
.Ev MTREE_FILE
can hold a list of file names, to which
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree
is always appended.
These specifications are rooted at
.Pa ${WRKINST} ,
and are subject to
.Ev SUBST_VARS
substitution, to ease
.Pa ${PREFIX}
independence.
This feature is primarily intended for large, interconnected ports,
such as the kde suite, where a base package sets up a large, extra
directory hierarchy that would make the manual checking of packing lists
tedious.
.It Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
Set to a list of package extensions for ports that create multiple packages.
See
.Qq Flavors and multi-packages
below.
.Pp
.It Ev NOT_FOR_ARCHS
List of architectures on which this port does not build.
See also
.Ev ONLY_FOR_ARCHS .
.It Ev NO_BUILD
Port does not need any build stage.
.It Ev NO_DEPENDS
Don't verify build of dependencies.
Do not use in any ports Makefile.
This is only meant as a user convenience when, e.g., you just want to browse
through a given port's source and do not wish to trigger the build of
dependencies.
.It Ev NO_REGRESS
Port does not have any regression tests.
.It Ev NO_SHARED_ARCHS
Set to the list of platforms that do not support shared libraries.
Use with
.Ev NOT_FOR_ARCHS .
.It Ev NO_SHARED_LIBS
Set to
.Sq Yes
if platform does not support shared libraries.
To be tested after including
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
if neither PFRAG.shared nor CONFIGURE_SHARED are enough.
.It Ev ONLY_FOR_ARCHS
List of architectures on which this port builds.
Can hold both processor-specific information (e.g., m68k), and more
specific model information (e.g., hp300).
.It Ev OPSYS
Always
.Ox
(read-only).
.It Ev OPSYS_VER
Revision number of
.Ox
(read-only).
.It Ev PACKAGES
Base location for packages built (default: ${PORTSDIR}/packages/${ARCH}).
.It Ev PATCH
Command to use to apply all patches.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/bin/patch .
.It Ev PATCHORIG
Suffix used by
.Ar patch
to rename original files, and
.Ar update-patches
to re-generate 
.Pa ${PATCHDIR}/${PATCH_LIST}
by looking for files using this suffix.
Defaults to
.Pa .orig .
For a port that already contains 
.Pa .orig 
files in the ${DISTFILES},
set this to something else, such as
.Pa .pat.orig .
See also
.Ar distpatch ,
.Ev DISTORIG .
.It Ev PATCH_CASES
In the normal distpatch stage (when
.Ev PATCHFILES
is not empty), this is the contents of a case statement, used to apply
distribution patches.
Fragments are automatically appended to handle gzip'ed and bzip'ed
patches, so that the default case is equivalent to the following shell
fragment:
.Bd -literal -indent
set -e
cd ${FULLDISTDIR}
for patchfile in ${_PATCHFILES}
do
    case $$patchfile in
	*.bz2)
	  bzip2 -dc $$patchfile | ${PATCH} ${PATCH_DIST_ARGS};;
	*.Z|*.gz)
	  gzcat $$patchfile | ${PATCH} ${PATCH_DIST_ARGS};;
	*)
	  ${PATCH} ${PATCH_DIST_ARGS} <$$patchfile;;
    esac
done
.Ed
.It Ev PATCHDIR
Location for patches applied by patch target (default: patches.${ARCH} or
patches).
.It Ev PATCHFILES
Files to fetch from the master sites like
.Ev DISTFILES ,
but serving a different purpose, as they hold distribution patches that
will be applied at the
.Ar patch
stage.
See also
.Ev SUPDISTFILES .
.It Ev PATCH_ARGS
Full list of options used while applying port's patches.
.It Ev PATCH_CHECK_ONLY
Set to Yes by the
.Ar checkpatch
target.
Don't touch unless the default
.Ar checkpatch
target needs to be redefined.
Ideally, user-defined patch subtargets ought to test checkpatch.
In practice, they don't.
.It Ev PATCH_DEBUG
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
the
.Ar patch
stage will output extra debug information.
.It Ev PATCH_DIST_ARGS
Full list of options used while applying distribution patches.
.It Ev PATCH_DIST_STRIP
Patch option used to strip directory levels while applying distribution
patches.
Defaults to -p0 .
.It Ev PATCH_LIST
Wildcard pattern of patches to select under ${PATCHDIR} (default: patch-*).
Note that filenames ending in .orig, or ~ are never applied.
Note that 
.Ev PATCH_LIST
can hold absolute pathnames, for instance to share patches among similar
ports:
.Bd -literal
PATCH_LIST=${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde/libs2/patches/p-* patch-*
.Ed
.It Ev PATCH_STRIP
Patch option used to strip directory levels while applying port's patches.
Defaults to -p0 .
.It Ev PORTHOME
Setting of env variable
.Ev HOME
for most shell invocations.
Default will trip ports that try to write into $HOME while building.
.It Ev PORTPATH
Path used by most shell invocations.
Don't override unless really needed.
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Root of the ports tree (default:
.Pa /usr/ports ) .
.It Ev PKGDIR
Location for packaging information (packing list, port description, port
short description).
Default: pkg.${ARCH} or pkg.
.It Ev PKGNAME
Name of the main created package.
Default is ${DISTNAME} for the main package,
and ${DISTNAME} for multi-package ports.
This does not take flavors into account.
See
.Ev FULLPKGNAME
for that.
.It Ev PKGNAME-foo
Package name for sub-package foo, if the default value
of ${PKGNAME}${SUBPACKAGE} is not appropriate.
.It Ev PKGPATH
Path to the current port's directory, relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
Read-only.
.It Ev PREFERRED_CIPHERS
List of cryptographic ciphers to use, in order of preference.
Default is
.Sq sha1 rmd160 md5 .
The first cipher that matches in ${CHECKSUM_FILE} is verified.
.It Ev PREFIX
Base directory for the current port installation.
Usually ${LOCALBASE}, though some ports may elect a location under 
.Pa /var ,
and some multi-package ports may install under several locations.
.It Ev PSEUDO_FLAVORS
Extra list of flavors that do not register in package names, but are still
used to control build logic, and e.g., working directory names.
Its main use is for disabling part of a multi-packages build, for instance:
.Bd -literal
FLAVOR=no_gnome make package 
.Ed
.Pp
Creation of a separate working directory is mandatory.
If, at a later time, a full build with all subpackages is required,
all the work will need to be done again.
.It Ev REFETCH
If set to true,
.Ar checksum
will analyze ${CHECKSUM_FILE}, and try retrieving files with the correct
checksum off 
.Pa ftp.openbsd.org ,
in the directory
.Pa /pub/OpenBSD/distfiles/$cipher/$value/$file .
.It Ev REGRESS_DEPENDS
See
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS 
for specification.
Regress dependencies are only checked if the regress stage is invoked.
.It Ev REGRESS_FLAGS
Flags to pass to ${MAKE_PROGRAM} to run the regression tests.
Defaults to ${MAKE_FLAGS}.
.It Ev REGRESS_IS_INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port needs human interaction to run its tests.
.It Ev REGRESS_TARGET
Target to run regression tests.
Defaults to
.Sq regress ,
except for 
.Sq perl
and 
.Sq gnu 
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE ,
which default to 
.Sq test
and
.Sq check
respectively.
.It Ev RUN_DEPENDS
Specification of ports this port needs installed to be functional.
Same format as BUILD_DEPENDS.
The corresponding packages will be built at
.Ar install
stage, and
.Xr pkg_add 1
will take care of installing them.
.It Ev SED_PLIST
Pipeline of commands used to create the actual packing list from the
PLIST template (usually ${PKGDIR}/PLIST).
.Nm
appends to it substitution commands corresponding to the port's
FLAVOR and variables from SUBST_VARS.
${SED_PLIST} is invoked as a pipeline after inserting PFRAG.shared fragments.
.It Ev SCRIPTDIR
Location for scripts related to the current port (default: scripts.${ARCH}
or scripts).
.It Ev SEPARATE_BUILD
Many gnu configure ports can be built in a directory distinct from the
place they were unpacked.
For some specific ports, this is even mandatory.
Set to
.Sq simple
if this is the case.
The ports infrastructure will generate a separate ${WRKBUILD} directory
in which the port will be configured and built.
Wipe ${WRKBUILD} to start anew, but skipping the extract/patch stage.
Set to
.Sq concurrent
if the build process does not modify anything under ${WRKSRC}.
The build process can then be run concurrently on different architectures.
Set to
.Sq flavored
if distinct flavors of the port may share a common source tree.
.It Ev SUBPACKAGE
Set to the sub package suffix when building a package in a multi-package port.
Read-only.
Used to test for dependencies or to adjust the package name.
.It Ev SUBST_VARS
Make variables whole values get substituted to create the actual package
information.
Always holds
.Ev ARCH ,
.Ev HOMEPAGE ,
.Ev PREFIX ,
and
.Ev SYSCONFDIR .
The special construct
.Sq ${FLAVORS}
can be used in the packing-list to specify the current list of dash
separated flavors the port is compiled with (useful for cross-dependencies
in
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES ) .
Add other
variables as needed.
.It Ev SUPDISTFILES
Supplementary files that need to be retrieved under some specific
circumstances.
For instance, a port might need architecture-specific files.
.Ev SUPDISTFILES
should hold a list of all distfiles and patchfiles that are not always
needed, so that a mirror will be able to grab all files, or that
.Ar makesum
will work.
Having an overlap between
.Ev SUPDISTFILES
and
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev PATCHFILES
is admissible, and in fact, expected, as it is much simpler to build
an error-free list of files to retrieve in that way.
See the xanim port for an example.
.It Ev SYSCONFDIR
Location for ports system configuration files.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc ,
should never be set to
.Pa /usr/local/etc .
.It Ev TAR
Name of the tar binary.
.It Ev TEMPLATES
Base location for the templates used in the
.Ar readme
target.
.It Ev TRUST_PACKAGES
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
dependency mechanisms will assume the database of installed packages is
correct.
See also
.Ev BIN_PACKAGES ,
.Ev BULK .
.It Ev UNZIP
Name of the unzip binary.
.It Ev WRKBUILD
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual build occurs.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}, unless SEPARATE_BUILD is involved, in which case
it is set to an appropriate value.
.It Ev WRKDIR
Location where all port activity occurs.
Apart from the actual port, may
hold all kinds of cookies that checkpoint the port's build.
Read-only.
Ports that need to know the WRKDIR of another port must use
cd that_port_dir && make show VARNAME=WRKDIR for this.
Note that WRKDIR may be a symbolic link.
.It Ev WRKDIST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the source is normally unpacked.
Base for all patches (default: ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}).
Note that WRKDIST may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKSRC
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual source is.
Base for configuration (default: ${WRKDIST})
Note that WRKSRC may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKPKG
Subdirectory of ${WRKBUILD} where package information gets generated.
Defaults to ${WKRBUILD}/pkg, do not override unless
.Sq pkg
conflicts with the port's conventions.
.It Ev WRKINST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where port normally installs (see
.Ar fake
target).
.It Ev WRKOBJDIR
If defined, used as a base for the actual port working directory.
The real working directory ${WRKDIR} is created there.
.It Ev X11BASE
Where X11 has been installed (default: /usr/X11R6).
.It Ev USE_GMAKE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if gnu make (${GMAKE}) is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.It Ev USE_LIBTOOL
Set to
.Sq Yes
if libtool is required for correct behavior of this port.
Adds correct dependencies, and passes LIBTOOL environment variable to
scripts invocations.
.It Ev USE_MOTIF
Set to
.Sq any
if port works with any version of motif;
.Sq lesstif
if port requires lesstif to work;
.Sq openmotif
if ports requires openmotif to work.
The
.Sq any
setting creates an extra flavor choice of 
.Sq lesstif .
.It Ev USE_X11
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port requires X11 to work.
.It Ev VMEM_WARNING
Set to 
.Sq Yes 
if the port requires a lot of memory to compile, and the user is
likely to see a message like 
.Qq virtual memory exhausted
with the default process limits.
.It Ev XMKMF
Invocation of xmkmf for CONFIGURE_STYLE=imake port.
Defaults to xmkf -a -DPorts.
The -DPorts is specific to
.Ox
and is always appended.
.It Ev YACC
Name of yacc program to pass to gnu-configure, defaults to yacc.
(gnu-configure would always try to use bison otherwise, which leads to
unreproducible builds.)
Set to bison if needed.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width files/md5
.It Pa ../Makefile.inc
Common Makefile fragment for a set of ports, included automatically.
.It Pa /cdrom/distfiles

.It Pa Makefile.${ARCH}
Arch-dependent Makefile fragment, included automatically.
.It Pa ${DISTDIR}
cache of all distribution files.
.It Pa distinfo
Checksum file.
Holds the output of
.Xr md5 1 ,
.Xr sha1 1 ,
and
.Xr rmd160 1
for the ports ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES}.
.It Pa ${FULLDISTDIR}/${ALLFILES}
cache of distribution files for a given port.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/DESCR
Description for the port.
Variables such as ${HOMEPAGE} will be expanded
(see SUBST_VARS).
Multi-package ports will use DESCR${SUBPACKAGE}.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/COMMENT
Short, one line description of the port, that is displayed by
.Xr pkg_info 1 ,
and appears in
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/INDEX .
Name will be adjusted for flavored and multi-packages ports.
.It Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree

.It Ar obj
Starting with
.Ox 3.3 ,
using
.Ev WRKOBJDIR
no longer creates a symlink between the current directory and
a subdirectory of ${WRKOBJDIR}, so
.Ar obj
has become a no-operation.

Some magic has been put in to allow for a seamless transition.
.It Ev DESCR_SRC
From
.Nx .
This is DESCR.
.Ox
does not give a specific name to the generated file.
It is not recommended to try to access them directly.
.It Ev EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS
Was used to cobble together the normal extraction command, as
${EXTRACT_CMD} ${EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS} ${EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS}.
Use
.Ev EXTRACT_CASES

.It Ev MASTERDIR
From
.Fx .
Used to organize a collection of ports that share most files.
.Ox
uses a single port with flavors or multi-packages to produce
package variations instead.
.It Ev MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR
Contents were used to replace 
.Sq %SUBDIR%
in all 
.Ev MASTER_SITES
variables.
Since
.Sq %SUBDIR%
almost always occur at the end of the directory,
the simpler
.Li ${VARIABLE:=subdir/}
construct is now used instead 
.Po

.It Ev MIRROR_DISTFILE
Use
.Ev PERMIT_DISTFILES_FTP
and
.Ev PERMIT_DISTFILES_CDROM
to determine which files can be mirrored instead.
See
.Xr mirroring-ports 7 .
.It Ev NEED_VERSION
Used to set a requirement on a specific revision of
.Nm
needed by a port.
No longer needed as
.Nm
should always be kept up-to-date.
.It Ev NO_CONFIGURE
If ${FILESDIR}/configure does not exist, no automatic configuration will
be done anyway.
.It Ev NO_EXTRACT
Set EXTRACT_ONLY= instead.
.It Ev NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES
Use
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
instead.
.It Ev NO_MTREE
Starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
the operating system installation script runs the /usr/local specification
globally, instead of embedding it in each package.
So packages no longer record an
.Xr mtree 8
specification.
Use an explicit
.Sq @@exec
command if needed.
.It Ev NO_PATCH
The absence of a patches directory does the same.
Use PATCHDIR and PATCH_LIST if patches need to be changed dynamically.
.It Ev NO_WRKDIR
All ports should have a working directory, as this is necessary to store
cookies and keep state.
.It Ev NO_WRKSUBDIR
The same functionality is obtained by setting WRKDIST=${WRKDIR} .
.It Ev NOCLEANDEPENDS
Use CLEANDEPENDS instead.
.It Ev NOMANCOMPRESS
.Fx
ships with compressed man pages, and uses this variable to control
that behavior.
.It Ev OBJMACHINE
Starting with
.Ox 3.3 ,
setting
.Ev WRKOBJDIR
creates the whole
.Ev WRKDIR
hierarchy under ${WRKOBJDIR}, so
.Ev OBJMACHINE
is no longer useful.
.It Ev PATCH_SITES
.Ev PATCHFILES
used to be retrieved from a separate site list.
For greater flexibility, all files are now retrieved from
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES0 , ...,

Used to refer to the full package name, has been superseded by
.Ev FULLPKGNAME-foo ,
for 
.Ev SUBPACKAGE
-foo .
.Ev PKGNAME
now holds the package name, not taking multi-packages or flavors
into account.
Most ports are not concerned by this change.
.It Ev PLIST_SUBST
From
.Nx
and
.Fx .
Use SUBST_VARS instead.
.Ox
does not allow general substitutions of the form VAR=value, but uses
only a list of variables instead.
Most package files gets transformed, instead of only the packing list.

Identical functionality can be obtained through a {pre,do,post}-* target,
invoking the script manually if necessary.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST.noshared
Use PFRAG.shared or PFRAG.no-shared instead.
PLIST.noshared was too easy to forget when updating ports.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST.sed
Use PLIST directly.
Until revision 1.295,
.Nm
did not substitute variables in the packing list unless this special form
was used.
.It Pa /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk
Original location of
.Nm bsd.port.mk .
The current file lives under 
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/mk/bsd.port.mk ,
whereas 
.Pa /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk
is just a stub.
.It Pa {scripts,files,patches}.${OPSYS}
The
.Ox
ports tree focuses on robustness, not on being portable to other operating
systems.
In any case, portability should not need to depend on operating
system dependent patches.
.It Pa /usr/local/etc
Used by
.Fx
to marshall system configuration files.
All
.Ox
system configuration files are located in
.Pa /etc ,
or in a subdirectory of
.Pa /etc .
.El
.Sh THE FAKE FRAMEWORK
The
.Ar fake
target is used to install the port in a private directory first, package
that false installation, so that the real installation will use the
package.
.Pp
Essentially,
.Ar fake
invokes a real
.Ar install
process after tweaking a few variables.
.Pp
.Ar fake
first creates a skeleton tree under ${WRKINST}, using the
.Xr mtree 8
specification
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree .
.Pp
A
.Ar pre-fake
target may be used to complete that skeleton tree.
For instance, a few ports may need supplementary stuff to be present (as
it would be installed if the ports' dependencies were present).
.Pp
If {pre,do,post}-install overrides are present, they are used with some
important changes: PREFIX is set to ${WRKINST}${PREFIX}, ${DESTDIRNAME} 
is set to ${WRKINST}, and TRUEPREFIX is set to ${PREFIX}.
Essentially, old install targets work transparently, except for a need to
change PREFIX to TRUEPREFIX for symbolic links and similar path lookups.
Specific traditional post install work can be simply removed, as it will
be taken care of by the package itself (for instance, ldconfig, or
texinfo's install-info).
.Pp
If no do-install override is present, the port is installed using
.Bd -literal -indent offset
    env -i ${MAKE_ENV}
    PREFIX=${WRKINST}${PREFIX} ${DESTDIRNAME}=${WRKINST} TRUEPREFIX=${PREFIX}
    ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${FAKE_FLAGS} -f ${MAKE_FILE} ${FAKE_TARGET}
.Ed
.Pp
Note that this does set both PREFIX and ${DESTDIRNAME}.
If a port's Makefile both heeds ${DESTDIRNAME}, 
and references PREFIX explicitly,
FAKE_FLAGS may rectify the problem by setting PREFIX=${PREFIX}
(which will do the right thing, since ${PREFIX} is a
.Xr make 1
construct which will not be seen by the shell).
.Pp
${FAKE_FLAGS} is used to set variables on
.Xr make 1
command line, which will override the port Makefile contents.
Thus, a port that mentions DESTDIR= does not need any patch to work with fake.
.Sh FLAVORS AND MULTI_PACKAGES
Starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
each port can generate several packages through two orthogonal mechanisms:
FLAVORS and MULTI_PACKAGES.
.Pp
If a port can be compiled with several options, set FLAVORS to the list of
possible options in the Makefile.
When building the port, set
.Li "FLAVOR='option1 option2...'"
to build a specific flavor of the port.
The Makefile should test the value of FLAVOR as follows:

.Ed
.Pp
.Pa bsd.port.mk
takes care of a few details, such as generating a distinct work directory for
each flavor, or adding a dash separated list of options to the package
name.
The order in which FLAVOR is specified does not matter: the generated list,
called the canonical package extension, matches the ordering of FLAVORS.
Also, it is an error to specify an option in FLAVOR that does not appear
in FLAVORS.
.Pp
In recursive package building, flavors can be specified as a comma
separated list after the package directory, e.g., SUBDIR+=vim,no_x11.
.Pp
Finally, packing information will use templates with the canonical package
extension if they are available: if FLAVOR='option1 option2' and both
COMMENT and COMMENT-option1-option2 are available, COMMENT-option1-option2 will
be used.
.Pp
If a port can generate several useful packages, set MULTI_PACKAGES
accordingly.
Each extension of a MULTI_PACKAGES name should start with a dash, so that
they cannot be confused with FLAVORS.
In dependency checking and recursive builds, a subpackage can be 
specified after a comma, e.g., SUBDIR+=quake,-server.
MULTI_PACKAGES only affects the actual package building step (and the
describe step, since a MULTI_PACKAGES port will produce several
descriptions).
.Pp
If MULTI_PACKAGES is set, each element of MULTI_PACKAGES triggers a
recursive make package, with SUBPACKAGE set to the right value, and
PACKAGING defined.
For instance, if MULTI_PACKAGES=-lib -server,
make package will work as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Run env SUBPACKAGE= PACKAGING= make package,
.It
Run env SUBPACKAGE=-lib PACKAGING=-lib make package,
.It
Run env SUBPACKAGE=-server PACKAGING=-server make package,
.El
.Pp
The port's Makefile can test the value of SUBPACKAGE to specialize
processing for all sub packages.
Note that SUBPACKAGE can also be set for dependency checking, so be 
careful to also test PACKAGING: the build stage is shared among all
subpackages, and tests often only make sense during the packaging stage.
All packing information is derived from
templates with SUBPACKAGE appended.
In the preceding example, the packing-list template for pkgname-foo
must be in PLIST-foo.
.Sh THE GENERATION OF PACKING INFORMATION
Starting after
.Ox 2.7
(around revision 1.300 of bsd.port.mk), all packing information is
generated from templates in ${PKGDIR}.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If not overridden by the user, determine which set of templates to use,
depending on the current SUBPACKAGE and FLAVOR information.
Set ${PLIST}, ${DESCR}, ${COMMENT}, ${MESSAGE} accordingly.
.It
Detect the existence of ${PKGDIR}/{REQ,INSTALL,DEINSTALL}${SUBPACKAGE}.
Modify PKG_ARGS accordingly, to use the generated files, and add
dependencies to regenerate the files if the templates change.
.It
Generate the actual DESCR, and if needed, MESSAGE, REQ, INSTALL, DEINSTALL
from the templates in ${DESCR}, ${MESSAGE}, ${PKGDIR}/REQ${SUBPACKAGE},
${PKGDIR}/INSTALL${SUBPACKAGE}, ${PKGDIR}/DEINSTALL${SUBPACKAGE}, by
substituting the variables in ${SUBST_VARS}, and by substituting
${FLAVORS} with the canonical flavor extension for this port,
e.g., if FLAVORS=no_map gfx qt2, if FLAVOR=gfx no_map, this is
.Sq -no_map-gfx .
.It
Generate the actual PLIST from the template ${PLIST},
by inserting shared/no-shared fragments, applying a possible user-supplied
pipeline, merging other fragments, applying the same variable
substitutions as other packing information, and finally handling
dynamic libraries macros.
.El
.Pp
Note that ${COMMENT} is currently not substituted, to speed up
.Ar describe
generation.
.Pp
To avoid substitution, variables can be escaped as follows:
.Li "$\e{PREFIX}"
.Pp
Constructs such as the line
.Li "%%SHARED%%"
or
.Li "!%%SHARED%%"
in the packing-list template trigger the inclusion of the
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.shared${SUBPACKAGE}
or
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.no-shared${SUBPACKAGE} .
.br
Similarly, if FLAVORS lists flav1, then the line
.Li "%%flav1%%"
(resp.
.Li "!%%flav1%%" )
will trigger the inclusion of
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.flav1${SUBPACKAGE}
(resp.
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.no-flav1${SUBPACKAGE} )
in the packing-list.
Fragments that cannot be handled by these simple rules
can always be specified in a custom SED_PLIST.
.Pp
The constructs
.Li "DYNLIBDIR(directory)"
and
.Li "NEWDYNLIBDIR(directory)"
should be used in
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.shared${SUBPACKAGE}
to register directories that hold dynamic libraries (see
.Xr ldconfig 8 ) .
.Li "NEWDYNLIBDIR"
is meant for directories that will go away when the package is deleted.
If possible, it should not be used, because users also have to edit 
.Pa rc.conf
to add the directory. 
It is usually better to also let libraries be visible as a link 
under ${LOCALBASE}.
Having a separate directory is enough to trick
.Xr ld 1
into grabbing the right version.
Note that libraries used only for 
.Xr dlopen 3
do not need NEWDYNLIBDIR.
.Pp
The special
.Ar plist
target does a fairly good job of automatically generating PLIST and
PFRAG.shared fragments.
.Pp
In MULTI_PACKAGES mode, there must be separate COMMENT, DESCR, and PLIST
templates for each SUBPACKAGE (and optional distinct MESSAGE, REQ, INSTALL,
DEINSTALL files in a similar way).
This contrasts with the FLAVORS
situation, where all these files will automatically default to the
non-flavor version if there is no flavor-specific file around.
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.Ev LOCALBASE ,
.Ev X11BASE
and
.Ev PREFIX
are not heeded consistently.
Most of the ports tree will probably fall
apart if one tries to build/use stuff elsewhere.
.Sh HISTORY
The ports mechanism originally came from
.Fx .
A lot of additions were taken from
.Nx
over the years.
.Pp
When the file grew too large, it was cleaned up to restore some of
its speed and remove a lot of bugs.
.Pp
FLAVORS, MULTI_PACKAGES and FAKE are
.Ox
improvements.
.\" Voluntarily undocumented:
.\" AUTOCONF_ENV: probably not needed anyway, should be internal.

hook will be invoked after the normal action.
Specialization hooks exist for
.Ar build ,
.Ar configure ,

Note that this does not affect bulk package building, since those links
don't appear in the upper-level Makefiles.
See also
.Ar unlink-categories .
a193 2

Build a port package (or packages in
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
cases) from the fake installation.
Involves creating packaging information from templates
(see
.Ev COMMENT ,
.Ev SED_PLIST ,
.Ev SUBST_VARS
among others) and invoking

a250 4
.It Ar reinstall
Force reinstallation of a port, by first cleaning the old installation.
.It Ar repackage
For rebuilding of the packages of a port, by first removing the old packages.
a254 26
.It Ar unlink-categories
Remove symbolic links in other directories that correspond to the port's
.Ev CATEGORIES .
See also
.Ar link-categories .
.It Ar update-patches
Create or update patches for a port, using
.Xr diff 1
between
.Pa file
and
.Pa file.orig ,
based on
.Pa file.orig
existence.
In order to generate a patch, the original file needs to be named

.Sh NAME
.Nm .forward
.Nd e-mail forwarding information file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users may put a file named
.Pa .forward
in their home directory.
If this file exists,
.Nm sendmail
(and sendmail-like mailers) will redirect mail for the user to the list of
addresses found in the
.Pa .forward
file.
.Pa .forward
files must not be group or world writable.
The users home directory should not be group writable.
The
.Pa .forward
file must be owned by and readable by the indicated user.
.Pp
A
.Pa .forward
file contains one or more lines where each line is an e-mail address
or the name of a private incoming mailer where incoming mail will be
forwarded.
Examples:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
# lines with # in the first column are ignored
# empty lines are ignored
# #@@# with whitespace on both sides may be used to start a comment

foo@@bar.baz.com				#@@# is a comment anywhere
"| /usr/local/libexec/slocal -user foo"

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.4
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Dt SPAMD.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm spamd.conf
.Nd configuration file read by
.Xr spamd-setup 8
for
.Xr spamd 8
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spamd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr spamd-setup 8
to configure blacklists and whitelists with corresponding
.Xr pf 4
table entries for
.Xr spamd 8 .
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr getcap 3 .
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
all:\e
	:spews1:white:myblack:\e

spews1:\e
	:black:\e
	:msg="SPAM. Your address \&%A is in the spews\e
	level 1 database\ensee http://www.spews.org/ask.cgi?x=\&%A\en":\e
	:method=http:\e	
	:file=www.spews.org/spews_list_level1.txt:

white:\e
	:white:\e
	:method=file:\e
	:file=/var/mail/mywhite.txt:\e

myblack:\e
	:black:\e
	:msg=/var/mail/myblackmsg.txt:\e
	:method=file:\e
	:file=/var/mail/myblack.txt
.Ed
.Pp
The default configuration file must include the entry
.Ar all
which specifies the order in which named blacklists and whitelists
are to be applied.
The addresses in a whitelist are removed from the preceding blacklist.
In the above example, if the address was present in all three lists, blacklists
.Ar spews1
and
.Ar myblack ,
as well as whitelist
.Ar white ,
the address would be removed from blacklist
.Ar spews1
by the subsequent
.Ar white
whitelist.
However, the address would not be removed from the
.Ar myblack
blacklist.
To remove all the addresses in
.Ar white
from
.Ar myblack ,
the configuration
.Bd -literal -offset indent
all:\e
	:spews1:white:myblack:white:\e
.Ed
.Pp
would be used instead.
.Pp
Blacklists and whitelists are then constructed by name;
blacklists are identified by the capability
.Ar black ,
and whitelists by the capability
.Ar white .
.Pp
The source of the addresses for blacklists and whitelists is
specified using the
.Ar method
and
.Ar file
capability entries.
.Pp
.Ar method
specifies the method by which to retrieve a file containing a list of
addresses that consist of the blacklist or whitelist, and may be
.Ar http ,
.Ar ftp ,
.Ar file
or
.Ar exec .
The methods
.Ar http ,
.Ar ftp
and
.Ar file
capabilities will make
.Nm
retrieve a list of addresses specified in the location in the
.Ar file
capability for the list.
The
.Ar exec
capability will make
.Nm
spawn the program with arguments indicated in the
.Ar file
capability for the list, and reads a list of addresses
from the output of the program.
.Pp
The format of the list of addresses is expected to consist of one
network block or address per line (optionally followed by a space and
text that is ignored).
Comment lines beginning with
.Ar #
are ignored.
Network blocks may be specified in any of the formats as in
the following example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# CIDR format
192.168.20.0/24
# A start - end range
192.168.21.0 - 192.168.21.255
# As a single IP address
192.168.23.1
.Ed
.Pp
Each blacklist must include a message, specified in the
.Ar msg
capability as a string.
If the
.Ar msg
string is enclosed in double quotes, the characters in the quoted string
are escaped as specified in
.Xr getcap 3
with the exception that a colon (:) is allowed in the quoted string.
The resulting string is used as the message.
Alternatively, if the
.Ar msg
string is not specified in quotes, it is assumed to be a local filename
from which the message text may be read.
.Pp
The message is configured in
.Xr spamd 8
to be displayed in the SMTP dialogue to any connections that match
addresses in the blacklist.
The sequence \e" in the message will produce a double quote in the output.
The sequence %% will produce a single % in the output,
and the sequence \&%A will be expanded in the message by
.Xr spamd 8
to display the connecting IP address in the output.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

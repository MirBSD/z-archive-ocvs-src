.Dt PASSWD.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd.conf
.Nd format of the password configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This configuration file is made obsolete by
.Xr login.conf 5 .
Support for the
.Nm
file will be removed in a future release of
.Ox .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
file, consisting of
.Dq stanzas ,
describes the configuration of the password cipher used
to encrypt local or YP passwords.
.Pp
There are default, user and group specific stanzas.
If no user or group stanza to a specific option is available,
the default stanza is used.
.Pp
To differentiate between user and group stanzas, groups are prefixed
with a colon
.Pq Ql \&: .
.Pp
Some fields and their possible values that can appear in this file are:
.Bl -tag -width localcipher
.It Sy localcipher
The cipher to use for local passwords.
Possible values are:
.Dq old ,
.Dq newsalt,<rounds> ,
.Dq md5 ,
and
.Dq blowfish,<rounds> .
For
.Dq newsalt
the value of rounds is a 24-bit integer with a minimum of 7250 rounds.
For
.Dq blowfish
the value can be between 4 and 31.
It specifies the base 2 logarithm of the number of rounds.
.It Sy ypcipher
The cipher to use for YP passwords.
The possible values are the same as for localcipher.
.It Sy pwdcheck
An external program that checks the quality of the password.
The password is passed to the program on
.Pa stdin .
An exit code of 0 indicates that the quality of the password is
sufficient, an exit code of 1 signals that the password failed
the check.
.It Sy pwdtries
The number of times
.Xr passwd 1
enforces a check on the password.
If it is 0, the new password will only be accepted if it passes
the password quality check.
The default is 3.
.El
.Pp
To retrieve information from this file use
.Xr pw_getconf 3 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use blowfish as the local cipher; add some more rounds for root and wheel
members.
The old Unix crypt is used as YP cipher:
.Bd -literal
 default:
      localcipher = blowfish,4
      ypcipher = old

 root:
      localcipher = blowfish,7

 :wheel:
      localcipher = blowfish,5
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/passwd.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/passwd.conf
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr passwd 1 ,
.Xr pw_getconf 3 ,
.Xr passwd 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
file appeared in
.Ox 2.1
and was deprecated in
.Ox 3.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

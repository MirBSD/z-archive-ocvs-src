.Dt MK.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mk.conf
.Nd system-specific configuration parameters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.own.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
To get system-specific configuration parameters,
.Aq bsd.own.mk
will try to include the file specified by the
.Ev MAKECONF
variable.
If
.Ev MAKECONF
is not set, or no such file exists, the system make configuration file
.Pa /etc/mk.conf
is included, if it exists.
For more information on how the make process works,
and details of the format of make files,
see
.Xr make 1 .
.Pp
\fBATTENTION:\fR This manual page might be out of date!
.Pp
.Aq bsd.own.mk
is generally useful when building Makefiles, so that
they use the same default owners, etc. as the rest of the tree.
These files may define any of the variables described below.
Additionally, see
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
for a list of variables that can be set by the
.Xr ports 7
subsystem.
.Sh VARIABLES
The following variables are set by
.Aq bsd.own.mk ,
if they are not already defined.
Defaults are in brackets.
.Bl -tag -width INSTALL_STRIP
.It Ev BINGRP
Binary group.
.Bq bin
.It Ev BINMODE
Binary mode.
.Bq 555
.It Ev BINOWN
Binary owner.
.Bq root
.It Ev BSDOBJDIR
The real path to the system 'obj' tree, so that 'make obj' will work correctly.
.Bq Pa /usr/obj
.It Ev BSDSRCDIR
The real path to the system sources, so that 'make obj' will work correctly.
.Bq Pa /usr/src
.It Ev DIRMODE
Mode for new directories.
.Bq 755
.It Ev DOCDIR
Base path for system documentation (e.g. PSD, USD, etc.) installation.
.Bq Pa /usr/share/doc
.It Ev DOCGRP
Documentation group.
.Bq bin
.It Ev DOCMODE
Documentation mode.
.Bq Ev ${NONBINMODE}
.It Ev DOCOWN
Documentation owner.
.Bq root
.It Ev INSTALL_COPY
The old usage of this flag is obsolescent, since
.Xr install 1
now copies by default.
However, it can also be used to specify that a file not be copied unless it
is different (via the
.Fl p
option).
See
.Xr install 1
for details.
This is to be used when building an install script so that the entire
system can either be installed with copies, or copy-if-different using a
single knob.
.Bq Fl c
.It Ev INSTALL_STRIP
The flag passed to the install program to cause the binary to be stripped.
This is to be used when building an install script so that the entire
system can be made stripped/not-stripped using a single knob.
Note that
.Ev INSTALL_STRIP
is not set if
.Ev ${DEBUG}
is defined.
.Bq Fl s
.It Ev LIBDIR
Base path for library installation.
.Bq Pa /usr/lib
.It Ev LIBGRP
Library group.
.Bq Ev ${BINGRP}
.It Ev LIBMODE
Library mode.
.Bq Ev ${NONBINMODE}
.It Ev LIBOWN
Library owner.
.Bq Ev ${BINOWN}
.It Ev LINTLIBDIR
Base path for
.Xr lint 1
library installation.
.Bq Pa /usr/libdata/lint
.It Ev MANDIR
Base path for manual installation.
.Bq Pa /usr/share/man/cat
.It Ev MANGRP
Manual group.
.Bq bin
.It Ev MANMODE
Manual mode.
.Bq Ev ${NONBINMODE}
.It Ev MANOWN
Manual owner.
.Bq root
.It Ev NONBINMODE
Mode for non-executable files.
.Bq 444
.El
.Sh ADDITIONAL VARIABLES
Additionally, the following variables may be set by
.Aq bsd.own.mk
or in a make configuration file to modify the behaviour of the system build
process (default values are in brackets along with comments, if set by
.Aq bsd.own.mk ) :
.Bl -tag -width GLOBAL_AUTOCONF_CACHE
.It Ev DEBUG
Add
.Fl g
to assembly, C compiler and linking passes.
Also doesn't set
.Ev STRIP
to
.Fl s
per default if defined.
.It Ev DEBUGLIBS
Create libraries with
.Fl g
debug information, and install them in
.Pa /usr/lib/debug .
.It Ev NOLINT
Do not build lint libraries.
.Bq yes
.It Ev NOPIC
Do not build PIC versions of system libraries,
and do not build shared libraries.
.It Ev PIPE
If set to
.Qq Ev -pipe ,
.Xr gcc 1
will be given the
.Fl pipe
option which can speed up compiles on machines with memory to spare.
Instead of using temp files,
.Xr gcc 1
uses pipes for the temporary data.
.It Ev SKEY
Compile in support for S/key authentication.
.Bq yes; set unconditionally
.It Ev SKIPDIR
A space separated list of directories to be skipped during "make build".
.It Ev SUDO
Command to run when doing "make install" portion of "make build".
If set to
.Ev sudo ,
this allows one to run "make build" as a user other than root
(assuming sudo is set up for that user).
.It Ev SYS_INCLUDE
Copy or symlink kernel include files into
.Pa /usr/include .
Possible values are "symlinks" or "copies"
(which is the same as the variable being unset).
.It Ev WARNINGS
Adds appropriate warning flags (defined in
.Ev CDIAGFLAGS ,
e.g.
.Fl Wall . . . )
to compiles.
.Bq no
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -compact
.It /etc/mk.conf
System make configuration file.
.It /usr/share/mk/*
System include make files.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr make 1 ,
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 ,
.Xr ports 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page first appeared in
.Ox 3.4 .
A preset
.Nm
file appeared first in
.Mx 1 ,
which was made modular in
.Mx 5
and totally redesigned for
.Mx 8 .

1.5
log
@First (probably not working[1]) attempt at modernizing the framework:
* MANZ, MANPS, NOPROFILE die (always set to false, false, true)
* Fortran generating code for <bsd.prog.mk> dies (pascal to follow)
* GLOBAL_AUTOCONF_CACHE dies (birth of <bsd.gnuwrap.mk> to follow...)
* sanitize my head and rewrite certain pieces of certain Makefiles
* move most mk.conf functionality out of there, so a system
  without mk.conf works really well(TM)
* attempt at synching docs with reality

[1] First update *.mk, then remove old mk.conf and mk.conf.local,
    then install new mk.conf and adapt it to suit your needs.

Why don't the OpenBSD people modernize parts of this? The indenting
is really really bad in places, and MANSUBDIR was... well. I have
done it with 1/3 of the code now, and it works. Even better.

There will definitively follow more ;-)

.Sh MK.CONF MODULES
You can customize mk.conf on the command line in
.Mx
by passing a module setting through.
All module settings possible are listet at the top of
.Nm
with their defaults, and possible values in brac
The value written in CAPS is the "safe" value, i.e. the
one assumed when no other value matches.
Currently, the following modules are defined:
.Bl -tag -width MKC_PGCC
.It Ev MKC_PGCC
If set to yes, CC is set to the in-tree gcc 2.95.3,
else CC and CXX are set to gcc/g++ 3.x.
.Bq no
.It Ev MKC_WARN
If set to yes, several warning flags are added to COPTS.
If set to all, even more pendantic warnings are considered.
.Bq no
.It Ev MKC_DEBG
If set to yes, COPTS will be enriched with -g and resulting
binaries are not stripped.
.El
a177 12
.It Ev GLOBAL_AUTOCONF_CACHE
Set to the name of a file that all cached GNU autoconf test results will be
saved in.
Reduces redundant tests.
Be careful!
Redundant tests may not be redundant when installing substantially
updated gnu programs.
.It Ev MANPS
Define to have PostScript manual pages generated.
Does not work with BSD nroff, needs GNU groff.
.It Ev MANZ
Compress manual pages at installation time.
a183 2
.It Ev NOPROFILE
Do not build profiled versions of system libraries.

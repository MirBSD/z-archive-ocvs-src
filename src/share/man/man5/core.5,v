.Nm core
.Nd memory image file format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
also cause a record of the process's in-core state to be written
to disk for later examination by one of the available debuggers (see
.Xr sigaction 2 ) .
This memory image is written to a file named
.Pa programname.core
in the working directory, provided the terminated process had write
permission in the directory, and provided the abnormality did not cause
a system crash.
(In this event, the decision to save the core file is arbitrary, see
.Xr savecore 8 . )
.Pp
The maximum size of a
.Pa programname.core
file is limited by
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
Files which would be larger than the limit are not created.
.Pp
The
.Pa programname.core
file consists of the
.Fa u .
area, whose size (in pages) is defined by the
.Dv UPAGES
manifest in the
.Aq Pa sys/param.h
file.
The
.Fa u .
area starts with a
.Fa user
structure as given in
.Aq Pa sys/user.h .
The remainder of the
.Pa programname.core
file consists of the data pages followed by the stack pages of the
process image.
The amount of data space image in the
.Pa programname.core
file is given (in pages) by the variable
.Fa u_dsize
in the
.Fa u .
area.
The amount of stack image in the core file is given (in pages) by the variable
.Fa u_ssize
in the
.Ar u .
area.
The size of a
.Dq page
is given by the constant
.Dv NBPG
(also from
.Aq Pa sys/param.h ) .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Fa md_coredump
is defined in the header file
.Aq Pa machine/pcb.h .

The on-disk core file consists of a header followed by a number of segments.
Each segment is preceded by a
.Fa coreseg
structure giving the segment's type,
the virtual address where the bits resided in process address space
and the size of the segment.
.Pp
The core header specifies the lengths of the core header itself and
each of the following core segment headers to allow for any machine
dependent alignment requirements.
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
struct coreseg {
	u_int32_t c_midmag;		/* magic, id, flags */
	u_long	c_addr;		/* Virtual address of segment */

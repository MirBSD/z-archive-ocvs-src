.Sh NAME
.Nm fstab
.Nd static information about the filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <fstab.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains descriptive information about the various file systems.
.Nm
is only read by programs, and not written;
it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create
and maintain this file.
Each filesystem is described on a separate line;
fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces.
The order of records in
.Nm
is important because
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
and
.Xr umount 8
sequentially iterate through
.Nm
doing their thing.
.Pp
The first field,
.Fa fs_spec ,
describes the block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted.
For filesystems of type
.Tn ffs ,
the special file name is the block special file name,
and not the character special file name.
If a program needs the character special file name,
the program must create it by appending an
.Dq r
after the last
.Dq /
in the special file name.
.Pp
The second field,
.Fa fs_file ,
describes the mount point for the filesystem.
For swap partitions, this field should be specified as
.Dq none .
.Pp
The third field,
.Fa fs_vfstype ,
describes the type of the filesystem.
The system currently supports twelve types of filesystems:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent -compact
.It adosfs
An
.Tn AmigaDOS
filesystem.
.It cd9660
An ISO9660 CD-ROM filesystem.
.It fdesc
An implementation of
.Pa /dev/fd .
.It ffs
A local
.Ux
filesystem.
.It ext2fs
A local Linux compatible ext2fs
filesystem.
.It kernfs
Various and sundry kernel statistics.
.It mfs
A local memory-based
.Ux
filesystem.
.It msdos
An
.Tn MS-DOS
FAT filesystem.
.It nfs
A Sun Microsystems compatible Network File System.
.It procfs
A local filesystem containing process information.
.It swap
A disk partition to be used for swapping.
.It union
A translucent filesystem.
.El
.Pp
The fourth field,
.Fa fs_mntops ,
describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.
It is formatted as a comma separated list of options.
It contains at least the type of mount (see
.Fa fs_type
below) plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type.
.Pp
The option
.Dq auto
can be used in the
.Dq noauto
form to cause
a file system not to be mounted automatically (with
.Ic mount -a ,
or at system boot time).
.Pp
If the options
.Dq userquota
and/or
.Dq groupquota
are specified, the filesystem is automatically processed by the
.Xr quotacheck 8
command, and user and/or group disk quotas are enabled with
.Xr quotaon 8 .
By default, filesystem quotas are maintained in files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated filesystem.
These defaults may be overridden by putting an equal sign
and an alternative absolute pathname following the quota option.
Thus, if the user quota file for
.Pa /tmp
is stored in
.Pa /var/quotas/tmp.user ,
this location can be specified as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
userquota=/var/quotas/tmp.user
.Ed
.Pp
The type of the mount is extracted from the first parameter of the
.Fa fs_mntops
field and stored separately in the
.Fa fs_type
field (it is not deleted from the
.Fa fs_mntops
field).
If
.Fa fs_type
is
.Dq rw
or
.Dq ro
then the filesystem whose name is given in the
.Fa fs_file
field is normally mounted read-write or read-only on the
specified special file.
If
.Fa fs_type
is
.Dq sw
then the special file is made available as a piece of swap space by the
.Xr swapon 8
command at the end of the system reboot procedure.
The fields other than
.Fa fs_spec
and
.Fa fs_type
are unused.
If
.Fa fs_type
is specified as
.Dq xx
the entry is ignored.
This is useful to show disk partitions which are currently unused.
.Pp
The fifth field,
.Fa fs_freq ,
is used for these filesystems by the
.Xr dump 8
command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.
If the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is returned and
.Xr dump 8
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.
.Pp
The sixth field,
.Fa fs_passno ,
is used by the
.Xr fsck 8
program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done
at reboot time.
The root filesystem should be specified with a
.Fa fs_passno
of 1, and other filesystems should have a
.Fa fs_passno
of 2.
Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially,
but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the
same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware.
If the sixth field is not present or is zero,
a value of zero is returned and
.Xr fsck 8
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.

.Pp
The proper way to read records from
.Pa fstab
is to use the routines
.Xr getfsent 3 ,
.Xr getfsspec 3 ,
.Xr getfstype 3 ,
and
.Xr getfsfile 3 .

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not

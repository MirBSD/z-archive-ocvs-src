.Sh NAME
.Nm remote
.Nd remote host description file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The systems known by
.Xr tip 1
and their attributes are stored in an
.Tn ASCII
file which is structured somewhat like the
.Xr termcap 5
file.
Each line in the file provides a description for a single remote host.
Fields are separated by a colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
Lines ending with a
.Dq \e
character immediately followed by a newline are continued on the next line.
.Pp
The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.
If there is more than one name for a system, the names are separated by
vertical bars
.Pq Sq \&| .
After the name of the system comes the fields of the description.
A field name followed by an equal sign
.Pq Sq =
indicates a string value follows.
A field name followed by a pound sign
.Pq Sq #
indicates a following numeric value.
.Pp
Entries named
.Dq tip\&*
.\"and
.\".Dq cu\&*
are used as default entries by
.Xr tip 1
.\"and the
.\".Xr cu 1
.\"interface to
.\".Xr tip 1 ,
as follows.
When
.Xr tip 1
is invoked with only a baud rate, it looks for an entry of the form
.Dq tip<baud rate> .
E.g.
.Ic tip -300
will cause
.Xr tip 1
to look for the system tip300.
.\"When the
.\".Xr cu 1
.\"interface is used, entries of the form
.\".Dq cu300
.\"are used.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean flags (bool).
A string capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar = Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Dq dv=/dev/harris .
A numeric capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar # Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Dq xa#99 .
A boolean capability is specified by simply listing the capability.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy \&at
(str)
Auto call unit type.
.It Sy \&be
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq beautify
to
.Sy on ,
so that non-printable characters will be discarded when scripting.
.It Sy \&br
(num)
The baud rate used in establishing
a connection to the remote host.
This is a decimal number.
The default baud rate is 300 baud.
.It Sy \&cm
(str)
An initial connection message to be sent to the remote host.
For example, if a host is reached through port selector, this
might be set to the appropriate sequence required to switch to the host.
.It Sy \&cu
(str)
Call unit if making a phone call.
Default is the same as the
.Sy dv
field.
.It Sy \&dc
(bool)
This host is directly connected, and
.Xr tip 1
should not expect carrier detect to be high, nor should it exit if
carrier detect drops.
.It Sy \&di
(str)
Disconnect message sent to the host when a disconnect is requested by the user.
.It Sy \&du
(bool)
This host is on a dial-up line.
.It Sy \&dv
(str)
.Tn UNIX
device(s) to open to establish a connection.
If this file refers to a terminal line,
.Xr tip 1
attempts to perform an exclusive open on the device to ensure only
one user at a time has access to the port.
.It Sy \&ec
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq echocheck
to
.Sy on ,
so that
.Xr tip 1
will synchronize with the remote host during file
transfer by waiting for the last character transmitted to echo.
.It Sy \&el
(str)
Characters marking an end-of-line.
The default is
.Dv NULL .
.Dq ~
escapes are only recognized by
.Xr tip 1
after one of the characters in
.Sy el ,
or after a carriage-return.
.It Sy \&es
(str)
The escape character for
.Xr tip 1 .
The default is
.Dq ~ .
.It Sy \&et
(num)
Number of seconds to wait for an echo response when
.Dq echocheck
mode is on.
The default value is 10 seconds.
.It Sy \&ex
(str)
Set of non-printable characters not to be discarded when scripting
with beautification turned on.
The default value is
.Dq \et\en\eb\ef .
.It Sy \&fo
(str)
Character used to force literal data transmission.
The default value is
.Sq \e020
(^P).
.It Sy \&fs
(str)
Frame size for transfers.
The default frame size is equal to
.Dv BUFSIZ .
.It Sy \&hd
(bool)
The host uses half-duplex communication, local echo should be performed.
.It Sy \&ie
(str)
Input end-of-file marks.
The default is
.Dv NULL .
.It Sy \&nb
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq beautify
to
.Sy off ,
so that non-printable characters will not be discarded when scripting.
.It Sy \&nt
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq tandem
to
.Sy off ,
so that XON/XOFF flow control will not be used to throttle data
from the remote host.
.It Sy \&nv
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq verbose
to
.Sy off ,
so that verbose mode will be turned off.
.It Sy \&oe
(str)
Output end-of-file string.
The default is
.Dv NULL .
When
.Xr tip 1
is transferring a file, this string is sent at end-of-file.
.It Sy \&pa
(str)
The type of parity to use when sending data to the host.
This may be one of
.Dq even ,
.Dq odd ,
.Dq none ,
.Dq zero
(always set bit 8 to zero),
or
.Dq one
(always set bit 8 to 1).
The default is no parity.
.It Sy \&pn
(str)
Telephone number(s) for this host.
Either a list of arbitrary dialing strings separated by
commas, or a
.Ql @@ .
An at sign,
.Ql @@ ,
tells
.Xr tip 1
to search the
.Xr phones 5
database for the list of telephone numbers.
.Pp
For modems or auto-call units that use a
.Ql \&,
in their dialing strings (hayes, courier, t3000)
.Xr tip 1
will convert any
.Ql \&=
in the string to a 
.Ql \&,
when dialing.
For modems or auto-call units that use a
.Ql \&=
in their dial strings, (v831),
.Xr tip 1
will convert any
.Ql \&_
to a
.Ql \&=
when dialing.
.It Sy \&pr
(str)
Character that indicates end-of-line on the remote host.
The default value is
.Sq \en .
.It Sy \&ra
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq raise
to
.Sy on ,
so that lowercase letters are mapped to uppercase before sending
them to the remote host.
.It Sy \&rc
(str)
Character that toggles case-mapping mode.
The default value is
.Sq \e001
(^A).
.It Sy \&re
(str)
The file in which to record session scripts.
The default value is
.Pa tip.record .
.It Sy \&rw
(str)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq rawftp

so that all characters will be sent as is during file transfers.
.It Sy \&sc
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq script
to
.Sy on ,
so that everything transmitted by the remote host will be recorded.
.It Sy \&ta
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq tandem
to
.Sy on ,
so that XON/XOFF flow control will be used to throttle data
from the remote host.
.It Sy \&tb
(bool)
Initialize the 
.Xr tip 1 
variable 
.Dq tabexpand
to
.Sy on ,
so that each tab will be expanded to 8 spaces during file transfers.
.It Sy \&tc
(str)
Indicates that the list of capabilities is continued in the named description.
This is used primarily to share common capability information.
.It Sy \&vb
(bool)
Initialize the
.Xr tip 1
variable
.Dq verbose

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs

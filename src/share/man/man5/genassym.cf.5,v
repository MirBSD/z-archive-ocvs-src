.Sh NAME
.Nm genassym.cf
.Nd assym.h definition file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is used by
.Xr genassym.sh 8
to make constant C expressions known to assembler source files.
.Pp
Lines starting with '#' are discarded by
.Xr genassym.sh 8 .
Lines starting with
.Em include ,
.Em ifdef ,
.Em if ,
.Em else
or
.Em endif
are preceded with '#' and passed otherwise unmodified to the C compiler.
.Pp
Lines starting with
.Em quote
get passed on with the
.Em quote
command removed.
.Pp
The first word after a
.Em define
command is taken as a CPP identifier and the rest of the line has to be
a constant C expression.
The output of
.Xr genassym.sh 8
will assign the numerical value of this expression to the CPP identifier.
.Pp
.Em "export foo"
.br
is a shorthand for
.br
.Em "define foo foo" .
.Pp
.Em "struct foo"
.br
remembers foo for the
.Em member
command and does a
.br
.Em "define FOO_SIZEOF sizeof(foo)" ,
.br
with the structure name converted to upper
case.
.Pp
.Em "member foo"
.br
does a
.br
.Em "define FOO offsetof(<last struct>, foo)" .
.br
The two argument form of
.Em "member" ,
as
.br
.Em "member foo bar"
.br
does a
.br
.Em "define FOO offsetof(<last struct>, bar)" ,
.br
with its first argument converted to upper case.
In the case where struct was
invoked with an extra argument, as in
.br
.Em "struct foo PREFIX_" ,
.br
the first argument of member will be prefixed by the remembered prefix, before
being converted to upper case.
.Pp
.Em "config <ctype> <gcc constraint> <asm print modifier>"
.br
can be used to customize the output of
.Xr genassym.sh 8 .
.br
When producing C output, values are cast to <ctype> (default: long)
before they get handed to printf.
<gcc constraint> (default: n) is the constraint used in the __asm__ statements.
<asm print modifier> (default: empty) can be used to force gcc to output
operands in different ways than normal.
The "a" modifier e.g. stops gcc from emitting immediate
prefixes in front of constants for the i386 and m68k port.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /sys/arch/${MACHINE}/${MACHINE}/genassym.cf
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr genassym.sh 8
.Sh HISTORY
The first use of
.Nm
files occured in
.Ox 2.2 .
Its use was generalized to all ports for
.Ox 3.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

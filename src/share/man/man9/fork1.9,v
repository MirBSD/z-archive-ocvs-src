.Dt FORK1 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fork1
.Nd create a new process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/proc.h>
.Ft int
.Fn "fork1" "struct proc *p1" "int flags" "void *stack" "size_t stacksize" "register_t *retval"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn fork1
creates a new process out of
.Ar p1 ,
which should be the current process.
This function is used primarily to implement the
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr rfork 2 ,
.Xr vfork 2
system calls, as well as the
.Xr kthread_create 9
function.
.Pp
The
.Ar flags
argument is used to control the behavior of the fork and is created by
a bitwise-OR of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width FORK_SHAREFILES
.It Dv FORK_FORK
The call is done by the
.Xr fork 2
system call.
Used only for statistics.
.It Dv FORK_VFORK
The call is done by the
.Xr vfork 2
system call.
Used only for statistics.
.It Dv FORK_RFORK
The call is done by the
.Xr rfork 2
system call.
Used only for statistics.
.It Dv FORK_PPWAIT
Suspend the parent process until the child is terminated (by calling
.Xr _exit 2
or abnormally), or makes a call to
.Xr execve 2 .
.It Dv FORK_SHAREFILES
Let the child share the file descriptor table with the parent through
.Xr fdshare 9 .
The default behavior is to copy the table through
.Xr fdcopy 9 .
.It Dv FORK_CLEANFILES
The child starts with a clean file descriptor table created by
.Xr fdinit 9 .
.It Dv FORK_NOZOMBIE
The child will be dissociated from the parent and will not leave a status
for the parent to collect.
See
.Xr wait 2 .
.It Dv FORK_SHAREVM
The child will share the parent's address space.
The default behavior is
that the child gets a copy-on-write copy of the address space.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa stack
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the area starting at
.Fa stack
of extent
.Fa stacksize
will be used for the child's stack, instead of cloning the parent's
stack.
.Pp
If
.Fa retval
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it will hold the following values after successful completion
of the fork operation:
.Bl -tag -width retval[0]
.It Fa retval[0]
This will contain the pid of the child process.
.It Fa retval[1]
In the parent process, this will contain the value 0.
In the child process, this will contain 1.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion of the fork operation,
.Fn fork1
returns 0.
Otherwise, the following error values are returned:
.Bl -tag -width [EAGAIN]
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit on the total number of system processes would be exceeded.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit
.Dv RLIMIT_NPROC
on the total number of processes under execution by this
user id would be exceeded.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
function semantics are specific to
.Ox .
Other BSD systems have different semantics.
.Pp
The system never uses
.Fn fork1
with a non-null
.Fa stack ,
so that feature is not even tested.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Pp
The signal
.Fa exitsig
is sent to the parent
.Fa p1
on exit of the new process.
.Pp
If
.Fa func
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the new process will begin execution by calling this function.
It defaults to child_return, which returns to userland.
.Pp
If
.Fa arg
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it is the argument to the previous function.
It defaults to a pointer to the new process.

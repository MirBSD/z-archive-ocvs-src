.Sh NAME
.Nm kthread_create ,
.Nm kthread_exit ,
.Nm kthread_create_deferred
.Nd kernel threads.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/kthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fn kthread_create "void (*func)(void)" "void *arg" "struct proc **newpp" "const char *fmt" ...
.Ft void
.Fn kthread_exit "int ecode"
.Ft void
.Fn kthread_create_deferred "void (*func)(void)" "void *arg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Kernel threads are system light-weight processes: cloned from process 0
(the swapper), sharing its memory map and limits, but with a copy of its
file descriptor table.
They don't receive broadcast nor group signals and they can't be swapped.
.Pp
Any process can call
.Fn kthread_create
to create a kernel thread.
The new process starts up executing
.Fa func
with argument
.Fa arg .
If
.Fa newpp
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it is filled with the address of the new process.
.Fa fmt
and the remaining arguments are used to name the process.
.Pp
A kernel thread will terminate by calling
.Fn kthread_exit ,
with exit code
.Fa ecode .
.Pp
Since the system has to be up and running for creating
new processes, device drivers that want to create kernel threads early
(e.g., at attach time) may use
.Fn kthread_create_deferred
instead.
The system will call back the function
.Fa func
with argument
.Fa arg
when it can create threads, so it is up to
.Fa func
to call
.Fn kthread_create
at that point.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fork1 9
.Sh BUGS
There is currently no way to use
.Va ecode
to any sensible purpose from
.Fn kthread_exit .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import OpenBSD repository of CTM 3155 (roughly today at noon).
Mostly in order to go 3.3-current and ease further merges of
both OpenBSD and ELFdiffs after the MirBSD has been enabled
to build again.

1.1.1.3
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

Otherwise, the following error values are returned:

1.1.1.5
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Dt BOOT 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd halt or reboot the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/reboot.h>
.Ft void
.Fn boot "int howto"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn boot
function handles final system shutdown, and either halts or reboots
the system.
The exact action to be taken is determined by the flags passed in
.Fa howto
and by whether or not the system has finished autoconfiguration.
.Pp
If the system has finished autoconfiguration,
.Fn boot
does the following:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Sets the
.Va boothowto
system variable from the
.Fa howto
argument.
.It
If this is the first invocation of
.Fn boot
and the
.Dv RB_NOSYNC
flag is not set in
.Fa howto ,
syncs and unmounts the system disks by calling
.Xr vfs_shutdown 9
and sets the time of day clock by calling
.Xr resettodr 9 .
.It
Disables interrupts.
.It
If rebooting after a crash (i.e., if
.Dv RB_DUMP
is set in
.Fa howto ,
but
.Dv RB_HALT
is not), saves a system crash dump.
.It
Runs any shutdown hooks by calling
.Xr doshutdownhooks 9 .
.It
Prints a message indicating that the system is about to be halted
or rebooted.
.It
If
.Dv RB_HALT
is set in
.Fa howto ,
halts the system.
Otherwise, reboots the system.
.El
.Pp
If the system has not finished autoconfiguration,
.Fn boot
runs any shutdown hooks by calling
.Xr doshutdownhooks 9 ,
prints a message, and halts the system.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

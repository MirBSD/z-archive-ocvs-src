.Nd interface between low and high level audio drivers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The audio device driver is divided into a high level,
hardware independent layer, and a low level hardware

.Ed
.Pp
The high level audio driver attaches to the low level driver
when the latter calls
.Va audio_attach_mi .
This call should be
.Bd -literal
    void
    audio_attach_mi(ahwp, hdl, dev)
	struct audio_hw_if *ahwp;
	void *hdl;
	struct device *dev;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va audio_hw_if
struct is as shown above.
The
.Va hdl
argument is a handle to some low level data structure.
It is sent as the first argument to all the functions
in
.Va audio_hw_if
when the high level driver calls them.
.Va dev
is the device struct for the hardware device.
.Pp
The upper layer of the audio driver allocates one buffer for playing
and one for recording.
It handles the buffering of data from the user processes in these.
The data is presented to the lower level in smaller chunks, called blocks.
During playback, if there is no data available from the user process
when the hardware requests another block, a block of silence will be
used instead.
Similarly, if the user process does not read data quickly enough during
recording, data will be thrown away.
.Pp
The fields of
.Va audio_hw_if
are described in some more detail below.
Some fields are optional and can be set to 0 if not needed.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv int open(void *hdl, int flags)
is called when the audio device is opened, with
.Va flags
the kernel represention of flags passed to the
.Xr open 2
system call
.Po
see
.Dv OFLAGS
and
.Dv FFLAGS
in
.Pa sys/fcntl.h
.Pc .
It should initialize the hardware for I/O.
Every successful call to
.Va open
is matched by a call to
.Va close .
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv void close(void *hdl)
is called when the audio device is closed.
.It Dv int drain(void *hdl)
optional, is called before the device is closed or when
.Dv AUDIO_DRAIN
is called.
It should make sure that no samples remain to be played that could
be lost when
.Va close
is called.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int query_encoding(void *hdl, struct audio_encoding *ae)
is used when
.Dv AUDIO_GETENC
is called.
It should fill the
.Va audio_encoding
structure and return 0 or, if there is no encoding with the
given number, return EINVAL.
.It Dv int set_params(void *hdl, int setmode, int usemode,
.Dv "struct audio_params *play, struct audio_params *rec)"
.br
Called to set the audio encoding mode.
.Va setmode
is a combination of the
.Dv AUMODE_RECORD
and
.Dv AUMODE_PLAY
flags to indicate which mode(s) are to be set.
.Va usemode
is also a combination of these flags, but indicates the current
mode of the device (i.e., the value of
.Va mode
in the
.Va audio_info
struct).
The
.Va play
and
.Va rec
structures contain the encoding parameters that should be set.
If the hardware requires software assistance with some encoding
(e.g., it might be lacking mulaw support) it should fill the
.Va sw_code
and
.Va factor
fields of these structures. 
See
.Pa /usr/src/sys/dev/auconv.h
for available software support.
The values of the structures may also be modified if the hardware
cannot be set to exactly the requested mode (e.g., if the requested
sampling rate is not supported, but one close enough is).
If the device does not have the
.Dv AUDIO_PROP_INDEPENDENT
property the same value is passed in both
.Va play
and
.Va rec
and the encoding parameters from
.Va play
is copied into
.Va rec
after the call to
.Va set_params .
The mi audio driver does some preliminary parameter checking: it verifies
that the precision is compatible with the encoding, and it translates
.Dv AUDIO_ENCODING_[US]LINEAR
to
.Dv AUDIO_ENCODING_[US]LINEAR_{LE,BE} .
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int round_blocksize(void *hdl, int bs)
optional, is called with the block size,
.Va bs ,
that has been computed by the upper layer.
It should return a block size, possibly changed according to the needs of the
hardware driver.
.It Dv int commit_settings(void *hdl)
optional, is called after all calls to
.Va set_params ,
and
.Va set_port ,
are done.
A hardware driver that needs to get the hardware in
and out of command mode for each change can save all the changes
during previous calls and do them all here.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int init_output(void *hdl, void *buffer, int size)
optional, is called before any output starts, but when the total
.Va size
of the output
.Va buffer
has been determined.
It can be used to initialize looping DMA for hardware that needs it.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int init_input(void *hdl, void *buffer, int size)
optional, is called before any input starts, but when the total
.Va size
of the input
.Va buffer
has been determined.
It can be used to initialize looping DMA for hardware that needs it.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int start_output(void *hdl, void *block, int bsize,
.Dv "void (*intr)(void*), void *intrarg)"
.br
is called to start the transfer of
.Va bsize
bytes from
.Va block
to the audio hardware.
The call should return when the data
transfer has been initiated (normally with DMA).
When the hardware is ready to accept more samples the function
.Va intr
should be called with the argument
.Va intrarg .
Calling
.Va intr
will normally initiate another call to
.Va start_output .
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int start_input(void *hdl, void *block, int bsize,
.Dv "void (*intr)(void*), void *intrarg)"
.br
is called to start the transfer of
.Va bsize
bytes to
.Va block
from the audio hardware.
The call should return when the data
transfer has been initiated (normally with DMA).
When the hardware is ready to deliver more samples the function
.Va intr
should be called with the argument
.Va intrarg .
Calling
.Va intr
will normally initiate another call to
.Va start_input.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int halt_output(void *hdl)
is called to abort the output transfer (started by
.Va start_output )
in progress.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int halt_input(void *hdl)
is called to abort the input transfer (started by
.Va start_input )
in progress.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int speaker_ctl(void *hdl, int on)
optional, is called when a half duplex device changes between
playing and recording.
It can, e.g., be used to turn the speaker on and off.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int getdev(void *hdl, struct audio_device *ret)
Should fill the
.Va audio_device
struct with relevant information about the driver.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int setfd(void *hdl, int fd)
optional, is called when
.Dv AUDIO_SETFD
is used, but only if the device has AUDIO_PROP_FULLDUPLEX set.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int set_port(void *hdl, mixer_ctl_t *mc)
is called in when
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_WRITE
is used.
It should take data from the
.Va mixer_ctl_t
struct at set the corresponding mixer values.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int get_port(void *hdl, mixer_ctl_t *mc)
is called in when
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_READ
is used.
It should fill the
.Va mixer_ctl_t
struct.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int query_devinfo(void *hdl, mixer_devinfo_t *di)
is called in when
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_DEVINFO
is used.
It should fill the
.Va mixer_devinfo_t
struct.
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv "void *allocm(void *hdl, int direction, size_t size, int type, int flags)"
.br
optional, is called to allocate the device buffers.
If not present
.Xr malloc 9
is used instead (with the same arguments but the first two).
The reason for using a device dependent routine instead of
.Xr malloc 9
is that some buses need special allocation to do DMA.
.Va direction
is
.Dv AUMODE_PLAY
or
.Dv AUMODE_RECORD .
Returns the address of the buffer, or 0 on failure.
.It Dv void freem(void *hdl, void *addr, int type)
optional, is called to free memory allocated by
.Va allocm .
If not supplied
.Xr free 9
is used.
.It Dv size_t round_buffersize(void *hdl, int direction, size_t bufsize)
optional, is called at startup to determine the audio
buffer size.
The upper layer supplies the suggested size in
.Va bufsize ,
which the hardware driver can then change if needed.
E.g., DMA on the ISA bus cannot exceed 65536 bytes.
Note that the buffer size is always a multiple of the block size, so
.Fn round_blocksize
and
.Fn round_buffersize
should be consistent.
.It Dv "int mappage(void *hdl, void *addr, int offs, int prot)"
.br
optional, is called for
.Xr mmap 2 .
Should return the map value for the page at offset
.Va offs
from address
.Va addr
mapped with protection
.Va prot .
Returns -1 on failure, or a machine dependent opaque value
on success.
.It Dv int get_props(void *hdl)
Should return the device properties, as per
.Xr audio 4
.Dv AUDIO_GETPROPS
ioctl, i.e., a combination of
.Dv AUDIO_PROP_xxx .
.It Dv int trigger_output(void *hdl, void *start, void *end,
.Dv "int blksize, void (*intr)(void*), void *intrarg,"
.br
.Dv "struct audio_params *param)"
.br
optional, is called to start the transfer of data from the circular buffer
delimited by
.Va start
and
.Va end
to the audio hardware, parameterized as in
.Va param .
The call should return when the data transfer has been initiated
(normally with DMA).
When the hardware is finished transferring each
.Va bsize
sized block, the function
.Va intr
should be called with the argument
.Va intrarg
(typically from the audio hardware interrupt service routine).
Once started the transfer may be stopped using
.Va halt_output .
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.It Dv int trigger_input(void *hdl, void *start, void *end,
.Dv "int blksize, void (*intr)(void*), void *intrarg,"
.br
.Dv "struct audio_params *param)"
.br
optional, is called to start the transfer of data from the audio hardware,
parameterized as in
.Va param ,
to the circular buffer delimited by
.Va start
and
.Va end .
The call should return when the data transfer has been initiated
(normally with DMA).
When the hardware is finished transferring each
.Va bsize
sized block, the function
.Va intr
should be called with the argument
.Va intrarg
(typically from the audio hardware interrupt service routine).
Once started the transfer may be stopped using
.Va halt_input .
Return 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va query_devinfo
method should define certain mixer controls for
.Dv AUDIO_SETINFO
to be able to change the port and gain.
.Pp
If the audio hardware is capable of input from more
than one source it should define
.Dv AudioNsource
in class
.Dv AudioCrecord .
This mixer control should be of type
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_ENUM
or
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_SET
and enumerate the possible input sources.
For each of the named sources there should be
a control in the
.Dv AudioCinputs
class of type
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_VALUE
if recording level of the source can be set.
If the overall recording level can be changed (i.e., regardless
of the input source) then this control should be named
.Dv AudioNrecord
and be of class
.Dv AudioCinputs .
.Pp
If the audio hardware is capable of output to more than
one destination it should define
.Dv AudioNoutput
in class
.Dv AudioCmonitor .
This mixer control should be of type
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_ENUM
or
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_SET
and enumerate the possible destinations.
For each of the named destinations there should be
a control in the
.Dv AudioCoutputs
class of type
.Dv AUDIO_MIXER_VALUE
if output level of the destination can be set.
If the overall output level can be changed (i.e., regardless
of the destination) then this control should be named
.Dv AudioNmaster
and be of class
.Dv AudioCoutputs .

.Sh NAME
.Nm copy
.Nd kernel copy functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/systm.h>
.Ft int
.Fn copyin "void *uaddr" "void *kaddr" "size_t len"
.Ft int
.Fn copyout "void *kaddr" "void *uaddr" "size_t len"
.Ft int
.Fn copystr "void *kfaddr" "void *kdaddr" "size_t len" "size_t *done"
.Ft int
.Fn copyinstr "void *uaddr" "void *kaddr" "size_t len" "size_t *done"
.Ft int
.Fn copyoutstr "void *kaddr" "void *uaddr" "size_t len" "size_t *done"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy contiguous data from one address to another.
All but
.Fn copystr
copy data from user-space to kernel-space or vice-versa.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "copyoutstr()"
.It Fn copyin
Copies
.Fa len
bytes of data from the user-space address
.Fa uaddr
to the kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr .
.It Fn copyout
Copies
.Fa len
bytes of data from the kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr
to the user-space address
.Fa uaddr .
.It Fn copystr
Copies a null-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from kernel-space address
.Fa kfaddr
to kernel-space address
.Fa kdaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating null,
is returned in
.Fa *done .
.It Fn copyinstr
Copies a null-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from user-space address
.Fa uaddr
to kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating null,
is returned in
.Fa *done .
.It Fn copyoutstr
Copies a null-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr
to user-space address
.Fa uaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating null,
is returned in
.Fa *done .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success or
.Er EFAULT
if a bad address is encountered.
In addition, the
.Fn copystr ,
.Fn copyinstr ,
and
.Fn copyoutstr
functions return
.Er ENAMETOOLONG
if the string is longer than
.Fa len
bytes.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

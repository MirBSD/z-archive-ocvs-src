.Sh NAME
.Nm rasops ,
.Nm rasops_init ,

.Fd #include \*[Lt]dev/wscons/wsdisplayvar.h\*[Gt]
.Fd #include \*[Lt]dev/rasops/rasops.h\*[Gt]
.Ft int
.Fn rasops_init "struct rasops_info *ri" "int wantrows" "int wantcols"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem is a set of raster operations for
.Xr wscons 9 .
.Pp
The primary data type for using the raster operations is the
.Em rasops_info
structure in
.Pa dev/rasops/rasops.h :
.Bd -literal
struct rasops_info {

	/*
	 * These must be filled in by the caller
	 */
	int	ri_depth;	/* depth in bits */
	u_char	*ri_bits;	/* ptr to bits */
	int	ri_width;	/* width (pels) */
	int	ri_height;	/* height (pels) */
	int	ri_stride;	/* stride in bytes */

	/*
	 * These can optionally be left zeroed out. If you fill ri_font,
	 * but aren't using wsfont, set ri_wsfcookie to -1.
	 */
	struct	wsdisplay_font *ri_font;
	int	ri_wsfcookie;	/* wsfont cookie */
	void	*ri_hw;		/* driver private data */
	int	ri_crow;	/* cursor row */
	int	ri_ccol;	/* cursor column */
	int	ri_flg;		/* various operational flags */

	/*
	 * These are optional and will default if zero. Meaningless
	 * on depths other than 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits per pel. On
	 * 24 bit displays, ri_{r,g,b}num must be 8.
	 */
	u_char	ri_rnum;	/* number of bits for red */
	u_char	ri_gnum;	/* number of bits for green */
	u_char	ri_bnum;	/* number of bits for blue */
	u_char	ri_rpos;	/* which bit red starts at */
	u_char	ri_gpos;	/* which bit green starts at */
	u_char	ri_bpos;	/* which bit blue starts at */

	/*
	 * These are filled in by rasops_init()
	 */
	int	ri_emuwidth;	/* width we actually care about */
	int	ri_emuheight;	/* height we actually care about */
	int	ri_emustride;	/* bytes per row we actually care about */
	int	ri_rows;	/* number of rows (characters) */
	int	ri_cols;	/* number of columns (characters) */
	int	ri_delta;	/* row delta in bytes */
	int	ri_pelbytes;	/* bytes per pel (may be zero) */
	int	ri_fontscale;	/* fontheight * fontstride */
	int	ri_xscale;	/* fontwidth * pelbytes */
	int	ri_yscale;	/* fontheight * stride */
	u_char  *ri_origbits;	/* where screen bits actually start */
	int	ri_xorigin;	/* where ri_bits begins (x) */
	int	ri_yorigin;	/* where ri_bits begins (y) */
	int32_t	ri_devcmap[16]; /* color -\*[Gt] framebuffer data */

	/*
	 * The emulops you need to use, and the screen caps for wscons
	 */
	struct	wsdisplay_emulops ri_ops;
	int	ri_caps;

	/*
	 * Callbacks so we can share some code
	 */
	void	(*ri_do_cursor)(struct rasops_info *);
	void	(*ri_updatecursor)(struct rasops_info *);
};

.Pp
Valid values for the
.Em ri_flg
member are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width RI_CURSORCLIP -compact
.It  RI_FULLCLEAR
eraserows() hack to clear full screen
.It  RI_FORCEMONO
monochrome output even if we can do color
.It  RI_BSWAP
framebuffer endianness doesn't match CPU
.It  RI_CURSOR
cursor is switched on
.It  RI_CLEAR
clear display on startup
.It  RI_CENTER
center onscreen output
.It  RI_CURSORCLIP
cursor is currently clipped
.It  RI_CFGDONE
.Fn rasops_reconfig
completed successfully
.El
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn rasops_init "ri" "wantrows" "wantcols"
Initialise a
.Em rasops_info
descriptor.
The arguments
.Fa wantrows
and
.Fa wantcols
are the number of rows and columns we'd like.
In terms of
optimization, fonts that are a multiple of 8 pixels wide work the
best.
.It Fn rasops_reconfig "ri" "wantrows" "wantcols"
Reconfigure a
.Em rasops_info
descriptor because parameters have changed in some way.
The arguments
.Fa wantrows
and
.Fa wantcols
are the number of rows and columns we'd like.
If calling
.Fn rasops_reconfig
to change the font and ri_wsfcookie \*[Ge] 0, you must call
.Fn wsfont_unlock
on it, and reset it to -1 (or a new, valid cookie).

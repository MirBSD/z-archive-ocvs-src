.Dt DOSHUTDOWNHOOKS 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm doshutdownhooks
.Nd run all shutdown hooks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn doshutdownhooks "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn doshutdownhooks
function invokes all shutdown hooks established using the
.Xr shutdownhook_establish 9
function.
Shutdown hooks are called in reverse order, i.e.,
the shutdown hook established last will be called first.
.Pp
This function is called from
.Xr boot 9
with interrupts turned off.
It is called immediately before the system is halted or rebooted,
after file systems have been unmounted, after the clock has been updated,
and after a system dump has been done (if necessary).
.Pp
Shutdown hooks are, like startup hooks, implemented via the more general
.Xr dohooks 9
API.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr boot 9 ,
.Xr dohooks 9 ,
.Xr dostartuphooks 9 ,
.Xr shutdownhook_establish 9

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

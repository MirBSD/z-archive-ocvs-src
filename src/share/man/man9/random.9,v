.Fn arc4random "void"
.Ft void
.Fn rnd_addpool_add "int"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn add_mouse_randomness ,
.Fn add_tty_randomness ,
.Fn add_net_randomness ,
.Fn add_disk_randomness
and
.Fn add_audio_randomness
routines are used to
supply data for the random data source device for further processing.
The processing involves calculating inter-event time delta and measuring
entropy contained in the resulting delta-T; the argument data supplied
is just mixed into the pool and does not increase the entropy counter.
.Pp
.Fn add_true_randomness
does not involve the usual timing calculations,
and causes the supplied data argument to be added to the entropy pool,
increasing the entropy counter by 32 bits.
.Pp
.Fn add_timer_randomness
will not cause the entropy counter to rise.
It is used to change the state of the pool periodically,
mostly by means of timing the random driver's operations.
.Pp
.Fn get_random_bytes
may be used to retrieve strong random data, just
as it would by the
.Xr srandom 4
device.
.Pp
.Fn arc4random
will give random 32 bit numbers hashed with
the ARC4 algorithm, which appears to be faster and less abusive
to the entropy pool.
.Pp
.Fn rnd_addpool_add
is a macro that can be used to push data from unreliable
random sources into the kernel.
This macro is safe to be called at almost any situation,
except from within
.Fn rnd_addpool_reinit .
The sysctl
.Dv KERN_PUSHRAND
can be used to disable input from this buffer.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arc4random 3 ,
.Xr pchb 4 ,
.Xr random 4
.Sh CAVEATS
None of these functions should really be called during the
.Xr autoconf 4
process.

@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any

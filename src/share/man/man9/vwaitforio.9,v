.Dt vwaitforio 9
.Os OpenBSD 2.9
.Sh NAME
.Nm vwaitforio
.Nd wait for all outstanding asynchronous writes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/vnode.h>
.Ft int
.Fn "vwaitforio" "struct vnode *vp" "int slpflag" "char *wmesg" "int slptimeo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vwaitforio
call sleeps until all asynchronous writes associated with the vnode
.Nm vp 
finish.
This is used by functions that need to make sure
that the writes they initiated have completed.
.Pp
The
.Fn vwaitforio
call sleeps at PRIBIO + 1.
The 
.Nm slpflag ,
.Nm wmesg , 
and
.Nm slptimeo 
flags indicate flags to be passed to
.Xr tsleep 9 .
.Pp
This function must be called at splbio().
.Pp
It may be important to ensure that no other process submits asynchronous
writes while a process is waiting for I/O on this vnode.
Otherwise, vwaitforio may never return.
.Pp
(Vnode interlock??)
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn vwaitforio
function returns 0 on success.
See
.Xr tsleep 9
for possible error returns.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vnode 9 ,
.Xr tsleep 9

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

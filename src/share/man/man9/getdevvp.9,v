.Ft int
.Fn getdevvp "dev_t dev" "struct vnode **vpp" "enum vtype type"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getdevvp
function creates a vnode for a device of type
.Fa type
with a device number of
.Fa dev ,
and returns a pointer to it in
.Fa vpp .

Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fa rootrefs"
.It Fa dev
The device number of the desired device.
.It Fa vpp
Where the vnode will be returned on success.
.It Fa type
The type of device, either:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv VBLK"
.It Dv VBLK
For a block device, or
.It Dv VCHR
for a character device.
.El

.Pp
.Fn bdevvp
and
.Fn cdevvp
use getdevvp internally, specifying the third argument.
.Fn bdevvp
will create a vnode for a block device, and is used for the root file system
and swap areas, among other things.
.Fn cdevvp
will create a vnode for a character device and is used in kernfs and in some
console handling.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
All functions return 0 on success.
If an error occurs, vpp will point to a NULLVP.
See
.Xr getnewvnode 9
for further return values.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed
stable enough.

.Sh NAME
.Nm radio
.Nd interface between low and high level radio drivers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The radio device driver is divided into a high level,
hardware independent layer, and a low level hardware
dependent layer.
The interface between these is the
.Va radio_hw_if
structure.
.Bd -literal
struct radio_hw_if {
	int	(*open)(void *, int, int, struct proc *);
	int	(*close)(void *, int, int, struct proc *);
	int     (*get_info)(void *, struct radio_info *);
	int     (*set_info)(void *, struct radio_info *);
	int     (*search)(void *, int);
};
.Ed
.Pp
The high level radio driver attaches to the low level driver
when the latter calls
.Va radio_attach_mi .
This call should be
.Bd -literal
.Ft void
.Fn radio_attach_mi "struct radio_hw_if *rhwp" "void *hdlp" \
                    "struct device * dev"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va radio_hw_if
struct is as shown above.
The
.Va hdlp
argument is a handle to some low level data structure.
It is sent as the first argument to all the functions in
.Va radio_hw_if
when the high level driver calls them.
.Va dev
is the device struct for the hardware device.
.Pp
The fields of
.Va radio_hw_if
are described in some more detail below.
.Bd -literal
.Ft int
.Fn open "void *" "int flags" "int fmt" "struct proc *p"
  Optional.
  Is called when the radio device is opened.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn close "void *" "int flags" "int fmt" "struct proc *p"
  Optional.
  Is called when the radio device is closed.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn get_info "void *" "struct radio_info *"
  Fill the radio_info struct.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn set_info "void *" "struct radio_info *"
  Set values from the radio_info struct.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

.Ft int
.Fn search "void *" "int"
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

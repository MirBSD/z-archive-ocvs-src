.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <bitstring.h>
.Ft bitstr_t *
.Fn bit_alloc "int nbits"
.Fn bit_clear "bit_str name" "int bit"
.Fn bit_decl "bit_str name" "int nbits"
.Fn bit_ffc "bit_str name" "int nbits" "int *value"
.Fn bit_ffs "bit_str name" "int nbits" "int *value"
.Fn bit_nclear "bit_str name" "int start" "int stop"
.Fn bit_nset "bit_str name" "int start" "int stop"
.Fn bit_set "bit_str name" "int bit"
.Fn bitstr_size "int nbits"
.Fn bit_test "bit_str name" "int bit"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These macros operate on strings of bits.
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_alloc
macro returns a pointer of type
.Li "bitstr_t *"
to sufficient space to store
.Fa nbits
bits, or
.Dv NULL
if no space is available.
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_decl
macro allocates sufficient space to store
.Fa nbits
bits on the stack.
.Pp
The
.Fn bitstr_size
macro returns the number of elements of type
.Li bitstr_t
necessary to store
.Fa nbits
bits.
This is useful for copying bit strings.
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_clear
and
.Fn bit_set
macros clear or set the zero-based numbered bit
.Fa bit ,
in the bit string
.Ar name .
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_nclear
and
.Fn bit_nset
macros clear or set the zero-based numbered bits from
.Fa start
to
.Fa stop
in the bit string
.Ar name .
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_test
macro evaluates to non-zero if the zero-based numbered bit
.Fa bit
of bit string
.Fa name
is set, and zero otherwise.
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_ffs
macro stores in the location referenced by
.Fa value
the zero-based number of the first bit set in the array of
.Fa nbits
bits referenced by
.Fa name .
If no bits are set, the location referenced by
.Fa value
is set to \-1.
.Pp
The
.Fn bit_ffc
macro stores in the location referenced by
.Fa value
the zero-based number of the first bit not set in the array of
.Fa nbits
bits referenced by
.Fa name .
If all bits are set, the location referenced by
.Fa value
is set to \-1.
.Pp
The arguments to these macros are evaluated only once and may safely
have side effects.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

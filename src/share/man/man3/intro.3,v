.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to the C libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cc
.Op Ar flags
.Ar file ...
.Op Fl llibrary
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The manual pages in section 3 provide an overview of the C library
functions, their error returns, and other common definitions and concepts.
Most of these functions are available from the C library,
.Em libc .
Other libraries, such as the math library,
.Em libm ,
must be indicated at compile time with the
.Fl l
option of the compiler.
.Pp
The various libraries (followed by the loader flag):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "libkvm" -compact
.It libbfd Pq Fl lbfd
GNU binary file descriptor library.
Allows applications to operate on object files,
regardless of the object file format.
See
.Sq info bfd .
.Pp
.It libc Pq Fl lc
Standard C library functions.
When using the C compiler
.Xr cc 1 ,
it is not necessary to supply the loader flag
.Fl lc
for these functions.
There are several
.Dq libraries
or groups of functions included inside of libc: the standard
.Tn I/O
routines,
database routines,
bit operators,
string operators,
character tests and character operators,
DES encryption routines,
storage allocation,
time functions,
signal handling,
and more.
.Pp
.It libcompat Pq Fl lcompat
Functions which are obsolete but are available for compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
In particular, a number of system call interfaces provided in previous
releases of
.Bx
have been included for source code compatibility.
Use of these routines should, for the most part, be avoided.
The manual page entry for each compatibility routine
indicates the proper interface to use.
.Pp
.It libcrypto Pq Fl lcrypto

.Sh LIBRARY TYPES
The system libraries are located in
.Pa /usr/lib .
Typically, a library will have a number of variants:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
libc.a
libc.so.30.1
libc_p.a
libc_pic.a
.Ed
.Pp
Libraries with an
.Sq .a
suffix are static.
When a program is linked against a library, all the library code
will be linked into the binary.
This means the binary can be run even when the libraries are unavailable.
However, it can be inefficient with memory usage.
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to link statically by specifying the
.Fl static
flag.
.Pp
Libraries with a
.Sq .so.X.Y
suffix are dynamic libraries.
When code is compiled dynamically, the library code that the application needs
is not linked into the binary.
Instead, data structures are added containing information about which dynamic
libraries to link with.
When the binary is executed, the run-time linker
.Xr ld.so 1
reads these data structures, and loads them at a virtual address using the
.Xr mmap 2
system call.
.Pp
.Sq X
represents the major number of the library, and
.Sq Y
represents the minor number.
In general, a binary will be able to use a dynamic library with a differing
minor number, but the major numbers must match.
In the example above, a binary linked with minor number
.Sq 3
would be linkable against libc.so.30.1,
while a binary linked with major number
.Sq 31
would not.
.Pp
The advantages of dynamic libraries are that multiple instances of the same
program can share address space, and the physical size of the binary is
smaller.
The disadvantage is the added complexity that comes with loading the
libraries dynamically, and the extra time taken to load the libraries.
Of course, if the libraries are not available, the binary will be unable
to execute.
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to link dynamically by specifying the
.Fl shared
flag, although on systems that support it, this will be the default and
need not be specified.
.Pp
Libraries with a
.Sq _p.a
suffix are profiling libraries.
They contain extra information suitable for analysing programs,
such as execution speed and call counts.
This in turn can be interpreted by utilities such as
.Xr gprof 1 .
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to generate profiling code,
or to link with profiling libraries, by specifying the
.Fl pg
flag.
.Pp
Libraries with a
.Sq _pic.a
suffix contain position-independent code
.Pq PIC .
Normally, compilers produce relocatable code.
Relocatable code needs to be modified at run-time, depending on where in
memory it is to be run.
PIC code does not need to be modified at run-time, but is less efficient than
relocatable code.
PIC code is used by shared libraries, which can make them slower.
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to generate PIC code,
or to link with PIC libraries, by specifying the
.Fl fpic
or
.Fl fPIC
flags.
.Pp
With the exception of dynamic libraries, libraries are generated using the
.Xr ar 1
utility.
The libraries contain an index to the contents of the library,
stored within the library itself.
The index lists each symbol defined by a member of a library that is a
relocatable object file.
This speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in the library
to call each other regardless of their placement within the library.
The index is created by
.Xr ranlib 1
and can be viewed using
.Xr nm 1 .
.Pp
The building of PIC versions of libraries and dynamic libraries can be
prevented by setting the variable
.Dv NOPIC
to yes in
.Pa /etc/mk.conf .
See
.Xr mk.conf 5
for more details.

* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

.Sh LIBRARY TYPES
The system libraries are located in
.Pa /usr/lib .
Typically, a library will have a number of variants:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
libc.a
libc.so.30.1
libc_p.a
libc_pic.a
.Ed
.Pp
Libraries with an
.Sq .a
suffix are static.
When a program is linked against a library, all the library code
will be linked into the binary.
This means the binary can be run even when the libraries are unavailable.
However, it can be inefficient with memory usage.
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to link statically by specifying the
.Fl static
flag.
.Pp
Libraries with a
.Sq .so.X.Y
suffix are dynamic libraries.
When code is compiled dynamically, the library code that the application needs
is not linked into the binary.
Instead, data structures are added containing information about which dynamic
libraries to link with.
When the binary is executed, the run-time linker
.Xr ld.so 1
reads these data structures, and loads them at a virtual address using the
.Xr mmap 2
system call.
.Pp
.Sq X
represents the major number of the library, and
.Sq Y
represents the minor number.
In general, a binary will be able to use a dynamic library with a differing
minor number, but the major numbers must match.
In the example above, a binary linked with minor number
.Sq 3
would be linkable against libc.so.30.1,
while a binary linked with major number
.Sq 31
would not.
.Pp
The advantages of dynamic libraries are that multiple instances of the same
program can share address space, and the physical size of the binary is
smaller.
The disadvantage is the added complexity that comes with loading the
libraries dynamically, and the extra time taken to load the libraries.
Of course, if the libraries are not available, the binary will be unable
to execute.
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to link dynamically by specifying the
.Fl shared
flag, although on systems that support it, this will be the default and
need not be specified.
.Pp
Libraries with a
.Sq _p.a
suffix are profiling libraries.
They contain extra information suitable for analysing programs,
such as execution speed and call counts.
This in turn can be interpreted by utilities such as
.Xr gprof 1 .
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to generate profiling code,
or to link with profiling libraries, by specifying the
.Fl pg
flag.
.Pp
Libraries with a
.Sq _pic.a
suffix contain position-independant code
.Pq PIC .
Normally, compilers produce relocatable code.
Relocatable code needs to be modified at run-time, depending on where in
memory it is to be run.
PIC code does not need to be modified at run-time, but is less efficient than
relocatable code.
PIC code is used by shared libraries, which can make them slower.
The C compiler,
.Xr cc 1 ,
can be instructed to generate PIC code,
or to link with PIC libraries, by specifying the
.Fl fpic
or
.Fl fPIC
flags.
.Pp
With the exception of dynamic libraries, libraries are generated using the
.Xr ar 1
utility.
The libraries contain an index to the contents of the library,
stored within the library itself.
The index lists each symbol defined by a member of a library that is a
relocatable object file.
This speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in the library
to call each other regardless of their placement within the library.
The index is created by
.Xr ranlib 1
and can be viewed using
.Xr nm 1 .
.Pp
The building of PIC versions of libraries and dynamic libraries can be
prevented by setting the variable
.Dv NOPIC
in
.Pa /etc/mk.conf .
The building of profiling versions of libraries and/or dynamic libraries can
be prevented by setting the variable
.Dv NOPROFILE
in
.Pa /etc/mk.conf .
See
.Xr mk.conf 5
for more details.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

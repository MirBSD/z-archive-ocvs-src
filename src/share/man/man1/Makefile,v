@bundle the gcc 2.95 manpage for good (even if there is no pgcc),
and remove most 2.95 specific stuff from gcc-local(1).
XXX gcc-local(1) still tells a bunch of lies
XXX not to speak of pgcc(1) and cccp(1), whose names too are crap

log
@* regenerate generated files (MAKEDEV, syscalls)
* regenerate i386->FLOPPY and sparc->GENERIC manually
* remove sun4 support from sparc kernel, because our CFLAGS
  prevent v7 from working anyways
* patch in Claudio Jeker's tap-for-tun diff, and fix his
  spelling and whitespace-at-eol (he delivers good KNF tho)
* move cccp.1 manpage to where gcc-local.1 landed as well
  (the FSF COPYING is a bit more restrictive, but easy enough;
  we have worse things in usr.sbin/?????/)
* bcopy, bcmp, bzero removal
* memcpy -> memmove where memcpy() is not available
* overhaul of headers (bcopy, too)
* a bunch more NULL and time_t fixes

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

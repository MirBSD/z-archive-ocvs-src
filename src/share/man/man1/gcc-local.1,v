@bundle the gcc 2.95 manpage for good (even if there is no pgcc),
and remove most 2.95 specific stuff from gcc-local(1).
XXX gcc-local(1) still tells a bunch of lies
XXX not to speak of pgcc(1) and cccp(1), whose names too are crap

.Sh NAME
.Nm gcc-local
.Nd local modifications to gcc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The GNU Compiler Collections come with special modifications for
.Mx .
.br
There is a compiler for the C language and assorted utilities available.
.Mx
currently delivers
.Sy GCC 3.2.3 .
.Bl -dash
.It
.Nm gcc
is the executable name for the gcc 3.x version which
currently comes with a
.Mx
base installation.
You might want to invoke
.Nm cc
for the C compiler instead.
.It
.Nm cpp ,
the C Preprocessor (refer to
.Xr cccp 1
for details) is the cpp version coming with gcc3.
.It
.Nm gcc
does not search under
.Pa /usr/local
for include files nor for libraries:
as a system compiler, it only searches the system paths by default.
.It
On
.Mx ,
the
.Fl pthread
option should be used to link threaded code, isolating the program from
operating system details.
.It
On most architectures,
trampoline code marks the smallest possible area around the trampoline stub
executable using
.Xr mprotect 2 ,
since the stack area is by default non-executable.
.It
The
.Fl O2
option does not include
.Fl fstrict-aliasing ,
as this option causes issues on some legacy code.
.Fl fstrict-aliasing
is very unsafe with code that plays tricks with casts, bypassing the
already weak type system of C.
.It
.Nm gcc
recognizes the extra format attribute syslog, to better match
the definition of
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and silence erroneous warnings when used with
.Fl pedantic .
.It
.Nm gcc
recognizes the extra attribute
.Dv __sentinel__ ,
which can be used to mark varargs function that need a
.Dv NULL
pointer to mark argument termination, like
.Xr execl 3 .
This exposes latent bugs for 64-bit architectures,
where a terminating 0 will expand to a 32-bit int, and not a full-fledged
64-bits pointer.
.It
On
.Mx ,
.Nm gcc
comes with the
.Dq propolice
stack protection extension (SSP), which is enabled by default.
This extension reorders local variable declarations and adds stack consistency
checks at run time, in order to detect stack overflows, and will attempt to
report the problem in the system logs, and abort the faulting process.
It can be turned off using the
.Fl fno-stack-protector
commandline option.
By default, all functions are protected, which unveils some code
generation bugs in the compiler; for more conservative code, use
.Fl fno-stack-protector-all .
Note that the stack protector relies on some support code in libc.
Stand-alone programs not linked against libc must either provide their own
support bits, or use the
.Fl fno-stack-protector
option.
.It
.Nm pgcc
recognizes a new flag,
.Fl Wbounded ,
to perform basic checks on functions which accept buffers and sizes.
An extra attribute,
.Dv __bounded__ ,
has been added to mark functions that can be
checked this way.
.It
.Nm gcc
recognizes a new format attribute, kprintf, to deal with the extra format
arguments
.Ql %b ,
.Ql %r ,
and
.Ql %z
used in the kernel.
.It
.Nm gcc
does not store its version string in objects.
This behavior can be restored with
.Fl fident .
.It
.Nm gcc
has been adjusted for the new
.Pa src/lib/csu/
layout in
.Mx 6 ,
including update of the specs for
.Pa /usr/lib/crti.o
and
.Pa /usr/lib/crtn.o
(from
.Nx ,
idea from defaults of other compilers).
.Mx
uses the
.Pa /usr/lib/crtbegin.o ,
.Pa /usr/lib/crtbeginS.o ,
.Pa /usr/lib/crtend.o
and
.Pa /usr/lib/crtendS.o
files from gcc3.
.It
The
.Nm cccp
manual page does not get installed as
.Nm cpp .
.It
A new option,
.Fl femit-memmove ,
has been added to
.Nm gcc
in
.Mx 8 .
If set, library calls to
.Xr memcpy 3
which can be emitted under certain circumstances
will be replaced with calls to
.Xr memmove 3 .
This is being used in the bootloader.
.El
.Sh ATTRIBUTES
The
.Dv __bounded__
attribute is used to type-check functions whose parameters pass fixed-length
buffers and their sizes.
The syntax for normal buffers is:
.Pp
.Li __attribute__ ((__bounded__ (
.Dv __buffer__ ,
.Va buffer ,
.Va length
.Li )))
.Pp
where
.Fa buffer
contains the parameter number (starting from 1) of the pointer to the buffer,
and
.Fa length
contains the parameter number of the buffer length argument.
.Pp
.Nm gcc
will emit a warning if the length argument is a constant larger than the
actual size of the buffer.
If the buffer is not a statically declared array of fixed length, no warnings
will be generated.
Refer to
.Xr memcpy 3
for an example of a function with this check.
.Pp
For checking strings, just use
.Dv __string__
instead of
.Dv __buffer__ :
.Pp
.Li __attribute__ ((__bounded__ (
.Dv __string__ ,
.Va buffer ,
.Va length
.Li )))
.Pp
In addition to the checks described above, this also tests if the
.Va length
argument was wrongly derived from a
.Fn sizeof "void *"
operation.
.Xr strlcpy 3
is a good example of a string function with this check.
.Pp
Some functions specify the length as two arguments:
the number of elements and the size of each element.
In this case, use the
.Dv __size__
attribute:
.Pp
.Li __attribute__ ((__bounded__ (
.Dv __size__ ,
.Va buffer ,
.Va nmemb ,
.Va size
.Li )))
.Pp
where
.Va buffer
contains the parameter number of the pointer to the buffer,
.Va nmemb
contains the parameter number of the number of members, and
.Va size
has the parameter number of the size of each element.
The type checks performed by
.Dv __size__
are the same as the
.Dv __buffer__
attribute.
See
.Xr fread 3
for an example of this type of function.
.Pp
If a function accepts a buffer parameter and specifies that it has to be of a
minimum length, the __minbytes__ attribute can be used:
.Pp
.Li __attribute__ ((__bounded__ (
.Dv __minbytes__ ,
.Va buffer ,
.Va minsize
.Li )))
.Pp
where
.Va buffer
contains the parameter number of the pointer to the buffer, and
.Va minsize
specifies the minimum number of bytes that the buffer should be.
.Xr ctime_r 3
is an example of this type of function.
.Pp
If
.Fl Wbounded
is specified with
.Fl Wformat ,
additional checks are performed on
.Xr sscanf 3
format strings.
The
.Ql %s
fields are checked for incorrect bound lengths by checking the size of the
buffer associated with the format argument.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cccp 1 ,
.Xr pgcc 1 ,
.Xr cpp 1 ,
.Xr gcc 1
.Pp
.Pa http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Fl Wbounded
flag only works with statically allocated fixed-size buffers.
Since it is applied at compile-time, dynamically allocated memory buffers
and non-constant arguments are ignored.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Dv __sentinel__
attribute is not yet fully implemented for
.Nm gcc 3.3.2 .
.Pp
The propolice stack protector, especially in
.Nm gcc
version 3.2.3, is still buggy, which can lead to strange effects.
For example, the Ada compiler has to be compiled with disabled
stack protection on eight (out of ca. 1300) files.
.Pp
Neither the
.Fl Wbounded
nor
.Fl Wnonnull
options have been ported to
.Nm gcc
3.2.3 yet.
Worse, the latter option generates a syntax error,
and null pointer warnings are silently discarded in
favour of a well-building base system.
.Pp
The
.Xr cpp 1
and
.Xr gcc 1
manual pages are part of GCC 3, and cannot be included in the
.Mx
operating system due to licence issues.
If you rely on these manual pages and the associated texinfo
documents, please install the
.Em books/gfdl-doc
package from MirPorts.
Alternatively, refer to the
.Xr cccp 1
and
.Xr pgcc 1
manual pages for simple usage information;
these are the gcc 2.95 versions.

There are two compilers for the C language and assorted utilities available.
a43 2
.Sy GCC 2.95.x
and
a44 6
On some architectures, both compilers are available, on others, only one
of these.
.Sy GCC 2.95
only comes with a C compiler, whereas
.Sy GCC 3.x
also delivers at least a C++ compiler.

.Nm pgcc
is installed as
.Pa /usr/bin/pgcc
in
.Mx ,
and the only language supported is C.
This is a heavily modified
.Sy GCC 2.95 .
This compiler is recommended to be used in order to check
for errors in software.
.It
.Nm gcc ,
if installed, is gcc3 which should support at least
C, C++, protoize, gcov, and in addition to that, can
support Ada, Pascal, Objective C.
Most of the extensions have been brought to both, and
gcc3 is believed to be the better compiler in general.
However, it has its shortcomings, thus
.Nm pgcc
is still left in as fall-back compiler.
d59 1
a59 2
for details) is always the version which comes with
gcc 2, unless only gcc 3 is available (for example on AMD64).
a60 3
Neither
.Nm pgcc
nor
d62 1

searches under
a88 9
The option
.Fl fno-builtin-<function>
was backported from
.Nm gcc 3.3.2 ,
to
.Nm gcc 2.95.3 ,
and can be used without having to differentiate between
both compilers.
.It
d90 1
a90 3
and
.Nm pgcc
recognize the extra format attribute syslog, to better match
a95 16
Even in 2.95.3,
.Nm pgcc
recognizes the attribute
.Dv __nonnull__ ,
which can be used to mark arguments that can't be
.Dv NULL .
This support is not ported to
.Nm gcc
version 3.2.3, but will be available in later versions.
The printf format attribute does not imply
.Dv __nonnull__
for the format.
This allows for correct format checking on the
.Xr err 3
function family.
.It
d97 1
a97 3
and
.Nm pgcc
recognize the extra attribute
a106 22
On some platforms,
.Nm pgcc
still uses
.Xr setjmp 3 /
.Xr longjmp 3 -
style exceptions, and so needs extra fixes beyond the pure 2.95.3 release.
.It
On a few
platforms (mostly a.out),
.Nm pgcc
uses a linker wrapper to write stubs that call global constructors and
destructors.
Those calls can be traced using
.Fl Wl,-trace-ctors-dtors ,
using
.Xr syslog_r 3 .
.It
On i386, the optimizer for
.Nm pgcc
features an extra peephole which reduces the function
prologues enough to allow for the ramdisk to fit on one floppy.
.It
a108 2
.Nm pgcc
and
d110 1
a110 1
come with the
d112 1
a112 1
stack protection extension, which is enabled by default.
d119 3

and
.Nm pgcc
recognize a new format attribute, kprintf, to deal with the extra format
d147 1
a147 3
and
.Nm pgcc
do not store their version string in objects.
d152 1

and

have been adjusted for the new
d163 8
d175 1

.Nm cpp
any longer since

a180 2
has been added to both

Thus, if you want to really check code on
.Mx ,
use

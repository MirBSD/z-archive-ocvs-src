.Dt ADB 4 mac68k
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm adb
.Nd Apple Desktop Bus event interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "adb0 at obio?"
.Cd "#option MRG_ADB" Pq "use ROM-based ADB driver"
.Fd #include <machine/adbsys.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Apple Desktop Bus
.Pq Tn ADB
is the single-master, multiple-slave, low-speed serial bus
interface used by Macintosh computers to connect input devices
such as keyboards, mice, trackballs, and graphics tablets
to the machine.
.Pp
The
.Nm
device is the sole interface to user input.
It combines both keyboard and mouse drivers into one event driver.
All user input is obtained by doing a
.Xr read 2
on the
.Nm
device.
Since most Macintosh mice have only one button, the
.Nm
driver will emulate a second and third mouse button with
the keyboard.
The
.Nm
device only supports being opened by one process at a time.
.Pp
There are two interfaces to the
.Tn ADB
hardware supported by the
.Nm
driver.
The older of the two relies on information in the Macintosh
.Tn ROM
to interface with the hardware.
This method is only available if the
.Dv MRG_ADB
option is defined in the kernel configuration file.
The newer method interfaces directly with the
.Tn VIA
hardware and with the Power Manager hardware if it is
present
.Pq e.g. on the PowerBooks .
The default configuration currently uses the
Macintosh
.Tn ROM
Glue
.Pq Tn MRG
method.
.Pp
The
.Xr ioctl 2
call is used to control the
.Tn ADB
event device.
The following is a list of available
.Xr ioctl 2
commands:
.Bl -tag -width ADBIOC_GETREPEAT
.It Dv ADBIOC_DEVSINFO
Get
.Tn ADB
Device Info
.Pp
The
.Nm
event device will return an array of information containing an entry
for each device connected to the bus.
Each entry contains the current address, default address, and handler ID for
the corresponding
.Tn ADB
device.
.It Dv ADBIOC_GETREPEAT
Get Keyboard Repeat Info
.Pp
Returns a structure containing the current keyboard repeat delay
and keyboard repeat interval.
.It Dv ADBIOC_SETREPEAT
Set Keyboard Repeat Rate
.Pp
Sets the keyboard repeat delay and interval to the values specified
by
.Ar argp .
.It Dv ADBIOC_RESET
.Tn ADB
Reset
.Pp
Perform a reset of the
.Tn ADB
which will reinitialize all of the devices attached to the bus.
.It Dv ADBIOC_LISTENCMD
ADB Listen Command
.Pp
Send data to the register of the
.Tn ADB
device specified by
.Ar argp .
This command is not fully implemented at this time.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
device supports the ADB hardware of most m68k-based
Macintosh models,
including the II-series, Centris- and Quadra-series, PowerBook-
and Duo-series, LC-series, and Performa-series models.
.Pp
Most standard
.Tn ADB
devices are supported by the
.Nm
driver, including mice which follow Apple's
Extended Mouse Protocol.
Many multi-button mice which follow a proprietary protocol are
not currently supported in multi-button mode.
The following is a partial list of supported
.Tn ADB
devices:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Apple Standard Keyboard
.It
Apple Extended Keyboard
.It
Apple Adjustable Keyboard
.It
Apple Desktop Bus Mouse

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag -compact
.It adb0 at obio0 (ADB event device).
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the presence of the
.Nm
event device.
.It adb: bus subsystem.
A standard autoconfiguration message indicating the initialization
of the
.Tn ADB
subsystem.
.It adb: no devices found.
No
.Tn ADB
devices were found to be connected to the bus during autoconfiguration.
.It adb: using %s series hardware support.
Indicates the class of
.Tn ADB
hardware support the machine uses.
.It adb: hardware type unknown for this machine.
The
.Tn ADB
hardware in this machine is currently unsupported.
.It "adb: no ROM ADB driver in this kernel for this machine."
The kernel lacks the necessary Macintosh ROM Glue
.Pq Tn MRG
support for accessing the
.Tn ADB
hardware on this machine.
.It adb: using serial console.
A serial console will be used for user input rather than the
.Tn ADB
event device.
.It adb: %s at %d.
An
.Tn ADB
device of the type specified by
.Em %s
has been found at location
.Em %d .
.El
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENXIO
No such
.Tn ADB
event device.
.It Bq Er EBUSY
Another process has the device open.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Invalid
.Xr ioctl 2
specification.
.It Bq Er EMSGSIZE
The size of the
.Tn ADB
event being read is too large to fit into the buffer
allocated to it.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/adb -compact
.It Pa /dev/adb

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 0.9 .
It is
.Ud .
.Sh AUTHORS
Bradley A. Grantham wrote the original
.Nm
driver, including the
.Tn MRG
support.
The hardware direct interface was written by
John P. Wittkowski.
The PowerManager interface was written by Takashi Hamada.
.Sh BUGS
.Bl -bullet
.It
Not every class of
.Tn ADB
hardware is supported yet.
.It
The talk command is currently unimplemented.
.It
The listen command is not implemented yet.
.It
Not all multi-button mice are currently supported.
.It
Only mapped and relative-position
.Tn ADB
devices
.Pq i.e. keyboards and mice
are supported.
Thus absolute-position and other exotic devices will not work.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm sn
.Nd Ethernet driver for SONIC-based ethernet adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sn* at obio?"
.Cd "sn* at nubus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
National Semiconductor DP83932 (SONIC) Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the
local network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface is currently known to support the following NuBus cards:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Cayman Gatorcard PDS
.It
Dayna DaynaPort/E30
.El
.Ed
.Pp
In addition, the
.Nm
interface supports on-board ethernet for 500-series PowerBooks and
non-AV Quadras.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ae 4 ,
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mc 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Ox 2.1 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm de
.Nd
.Tn DEC DEUNA
10 Mb/s Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "de0 at uba? csr 0174510"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm de
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through
a Digital Equipment
.Tn UNIBUS
Network Adapter
.Pq Tn DEUNA .
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm de
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
The interface normally tries to use a
.Dq trailer
encapsulation
to minimize copying data on input and output.
The use of trailers is negotiated with
.Tn ARP .
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the
.Dv IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an
.Dv SIOCSIFFLAGS
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It de%d: hardware address %s.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
ethernet address of the adapter.
.Pp
.It de%d: oerror, flags=%b tdrerr=%b (len=%d).
The hardware indicated an error
in transmitting a packet to the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.Pp
.It de%d: ierror, flags=%b lenerr=%b (len=%d).
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet from the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.Pp
.It de%d: can't handle af%d.
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
.Pp
.It de%d: buffer unavailable.
The interface received more packets
than it had buffers allocated to receive them.
.Pp
.It de%d: address change failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
The interface was unable to reprogram
its physical ethernet address.
This may happen with very early models of the interface.
This facility is used only when
the controller is not the first network interface configured for
.Tn XNS .
.El
.Pp
The following messages indicate a probable hardware error performing
the indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.
The two control and status registers
should indicate the nature of the failure.
See the hardware manual for details.
.Pp
.Bl -diag
.It de%d: reset failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: ppcb failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: read addr failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: wtring failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: wtmode failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

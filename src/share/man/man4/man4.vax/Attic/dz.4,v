.Sh NAME
.Nm dz
.Nd
.Tn DZ-11
multiplexer device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dz0 at uba0 csr 0160100"
.Cd "dz0 at vsbus0 csr 0x200a0000" Pq "DC-367"
.Cd "dz0 at vsbus0 csr 0x25000000" Pq "VS4000/90 4000/10x MV3100/9x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Tn DZ-11
provides 4 or 8 communication lines with partial modem control,
adequate for
.Ox
dialup use.
.Pp
An optional argument
.Ar flags
may be supplied with the device specification
in the config file indicating
that the line corresponding to
bit number
.Ar i
is not properly
connected, and should be treated as hard-wired with carrier
always present.
Thus specifying
.Ql flags 0x04
for
.Li dz0
would cause line
.Pa tty02
to be treated in this way.
.Pp
Normal I/O
control parameters for individual lines are managed by
.Xr ioctl 2
calls.
Line speeds may be initiated via
the
.Xr ttys 5
file or
.Xr stty 1 ,
see
.Xr tty 4 .
.Pp
The
.Nm dz
driver monitors the rate of input on each board,
and switches between the use of character-at-a-time interrupts
and input silos.
While the silo is enabled during periods of high-speed input,
the driver polls for input 30 times per second.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/tty[0-9][0-9]xx -compact

dialups
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It dz%d: silo overflow.
The 64 character input silo overflowed
before it could be serviced.
This can happen if a hard error occurs when the
.Tn CPU
is running with elevated priority, as the system will
then print a message on the console with interrupts disabled.
It is not serious.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

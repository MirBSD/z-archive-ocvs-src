.Dt OPTIONS 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm options
.Nd miscellaneous kernel configuration options
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd option ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes a number of miscellaneous kernel
configuration options that may be specified in a kernel config file.
See
.Xr config 8
for information on how to configure and build kernels.
.Em Note:
options are passed to the compile process as
.Fl D
flags to the C compiler.
.Ss Compatibility Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option COMPAT_BSDOS
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Em BSD/OS
applications.
This option is supported on the i386 architecture.
See
.Xr compat_bsdos 8 .
.It Cd option COMPAT_LINUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Em Linux
ELF and a.out
applications built for the same architecture.
This option is supported on the i386 architecture.
See
.Xr compat_linux 8 .
.It Cd option COMPAT_FREEBSD
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Em FreeBSD
applications built for the same architecture.
This option is available on the i386 architecture.
See
.Xr compat_freebsd 8 .
.El
.Ss Debugging Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option DDB
Compiles in a kernel debugger for diagnosing kernel problems.
See
.Xr ddb 4
for details.
.Em Note:
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd option DDB_SAFE_CONSOLE
Allows a break into the kernel debugger during boot.
Useful when debugging problems that can cause init(8) to fail.
.It Cd option KGDB
Compiles in a remote kernel debugger stub for diagnosing kernel problems
using the
.Dq remote target
feature of gdb.
See
.Xr kgdb 7
for details.
.Em Note:
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd makeoptions DEBUG="-g"
The
.Fl g
flag causes
.Pa bsd.gdb
to be built in addition to
.Pa bsd .
.Pa bsd.gdb
is useful for debugging kernels and their crash dumps with gdb.
Note that
.Xr gdb 1 Ns 's
.Fl k
flag is obsolete and should not be used.
Instead, a crash dump can be debugged by starting
.Xr gdb 1
with the kernel name as an argument (no core file) and then use the
.Xr gdb 1
command
.Dq target kcore COREFILE .
.It Cd option DEBUG
Turns on miscellaneous kernel debugging.
Since options are turned into preprocessor defines (see above),
.Cm option DEBUG
is equivalent to doing a
.Em #define DEBUG
throughout the kernel.
Much of the kernel has
.Em #ifdef DEBUG
conditional debugging code.
Note that many parts of the kernel (typically device drivers) include their own
.Em #ifdef XXX_DEBUG
conditionals instead.
This option also turns on certain other options, notably
.Cm option KMEMSTATS ,
which may decrease system performance.
.It Cd option DIAGNOSTIC
Adds code to the kernel that does internal consistency checks.
This code will cause the kernel to panic if corruption of internal data
structures is detected.
.It Cd option SMALL_KERNEL
Removes some optimizations from the kernel to reduce the size of the
resulting kernel binary.
This option can decrease system performance.
.It Cd option NO_PROPOLICE
Do not compile the kernel with the propolice stack protection.
See
.Xr gcc-local 1
for more information about propolice.
.It Cd option GPROF
Adds code to the kernel for kernel profiling with
.Xr kgmon 8 .
.It Cd makeoptions PROF="-pg"
The
.Fl pg
flag causes the kernel to be compiled with support for profiling.
The
.Cm option GPROF
is required for the kernel compile to succeed.
.It Cd option KTRACE
Adds hooks for the system call tracing facility, which allows users to
watch the system call invocation behavior of processes.
See
.Xr ktrace 1
for details.
.It Cd option PTRACE
Adds hooks for the process tracing facility, allowing a process to
control and observe another process.
See
.Xr ptrace 2
for details.
.It Cd option RAIDDEBUG
Be verbose on what RAIDframe does.
See
.Xr raid 4
for details.
.El
.Ss File Systems
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option FFS
Includes code implementing the Berkeley Fast File System
.Em ( FFS ) .
Most machines need this if they are not running diskless.
.It Cd option EXT2FS
Includes code implementing the Second Extended File System
.Em ( EXT2FS ) .
This is the most commonly used file system on the Linux operating system,
and is provided here for compatibility.
Some specific features of
.Em EXT2FS
like the "behavior on errors" are not implemented.
This file system
can't be used with
.Li uid_t
or
.Li gid_t
values greater than 65535.
Also, the filesystem will not function correctly on architectures with
differing byte-orders.
That is, a big-endian machine will not be able to read an
ext2fs filesystem created on an i386 or other little-endian machine.
See
.Xr mount_ext2fs 8
for details.
.It Cd option MFS
Include the memory file system
.Em ( MFS ) .
This file system stores files in swappable memory, and produces
notable performance improvements when it is used as the file store
for
.Pa /tmp
or similar mount points.
See
.Xr mount_mfs 8
for details.
.It Cd option NFSCLIENT
Include the client side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to work.
See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for details on NFS.
.It Cd option CD9660
Includes code for the ISO 9660 + Rock Ridge file system, which is the
standard file system used on many CD-ROMs.
It also supports Joliet extensions.
See
.Xr mount_cd9660 8
for details.
.It Cd option MSDOSFS
Includes support for the
.Tn MS-DOS
FAT file system.
The kernel also implements the
.Tn Windows 95
extensions which permit the use of longer, mixed-case file names.
See
.Xr mount_msdos 8
and
.Xr fsck_msdos 8
for details.
.It Cd option NTFS
Includes support for reading NTFS file systems.
Experimental and read only.
See
.Xr mount_ntfs 8
for details.
.It Cd option FDESC
Includes code for a file system which can be mounted on
.Pa /dev/fd .
This filesystem permits access to the per-process file descriptor
space via special files in the file system.
See
.Xr mount_fdesc 8
for details.
Note that this facility is redundant, and thus unneeded on most
.Ox
systems, since the
.Xr fd 4
pseudo-device driver already provides identical functionality.
On most systems, instances of
.Xr fd 4
are mknoded under
.Pa /dev/fd/
and on
.Pa /dev/stdin ,
.Pa /dev/stdout ,
and
.Pa /dev/stderr .
.It Cd option KERNFS
Includes code which permits the mounting of a special file system
(normally mounted on
.Pa /kern )
in which files representing various kernel variables and parameters
may be found.
See
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
for details.
.It Cd option NULLFS
Includes code for a loopback file system.
This permits portions of the file hierarchy to be re-mounted in other places.
The code really exists to provide an example of a stackable file system layer.
See
.Xr mount_null 8
for details.
.It Cd option PORTAL
Includes the (experimental) portal filesystem.
This permits interesting tricks like opening TCP sockets by opening files in
the file system.
The portal file system is conventionally mounted on
.Pa /p
and is partially implemented by a special daemon.
See
.Xr mount_portal 8
for details.
.It Cd option PROCFS
Includes code for a special file system (conventionally mounted on
.Pa /proc )
in which the process space becomes visible in the file system.
Among other things, the memory spaces of processes running on the system are
visible as files, and signals may be sent to processes by writing to
.Pa ctl
files in the procfs namespace.
See
.Xr mount_procfs 8
for details.
.It Cd option UMAPFS
Includes a loopback file system in which user and group IDs may be
remapped -- this can be useful when mounting alien file systems with
different uids and gids than the local system (eg, remote NFS).
See
.Xr mount_umap 8
for details.
.It Cd option UNION
Includes code for the union file system, which permits directories to
be mounted on top of each other in such a way that both file systems
remain visible -- this permits tricks like allowing writing (and the
deleting of files) on a read-only file system like a CD-ROM by
mounting a local writable file system on top of the read-only file
system.
This filesystem is still experimental and is known to be somewhat unstable.
See
.Xr mount_union 8
for details.
.El
.Ss File System Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option FFS_SOFTUPDATES
Enables a scheme that uses partial ordering of buffer cache operations
to allow metadata updates in FFS to happen asynchronously, increasing write
performance significantly.
Normally, the FFS filesystem writes metadata updates synchronously which exacts
a performance penalty in favor of filesystem integrity.
With soft updates, the performance of asynchronous writes is gained while
retaining the safety of synchronous metadata updates.
.Pp
Soft updates must be enabled on a per-filesystem basis.
See
.Xr mount 8
for details.
.Pp
Processors with a small kernel address space, such as the sun4 and sun4c, do
not have enough kernel memory to support soft updates.
Attempts to use this option with these CPUs will cause a kernel hang or panic
after a short period of use as the kernel will quickly run out of memory.
This is not related to the amount of physical memory present in the machine --
it is a limitation of the CPU architecture itself.
.It Cd option BUFCACHEPERCENT=integer
Percentage of RAM to use as a file system buffer.
It defaults to 5.
.It Cd option NFSSERVER
Include the server side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to
work.
See
.Xr mountd 8
and
.Xr nfsd 8
for details.
.It Cd option QUOTA
Enables kernel support for file system quotas.
See
.Xr quotaon 8 ,
.Xr edquota 8 ,
.Xr repquota 8 ,
and
.Xr quota 1
for details.
Note that quotas only work on
.Dq ffs
file systems, although
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
permits them to be accessed over
.Em NFS .
.It Cd option FIFO
Adds support for
.At V
style FIFOs (i.e.,
.Dq named pipes ) .
This option is recommended in almost all cases as many programs use these.
.It Cd option EXT2FS_SYSTEM_FLAGS
This option changes the behavior of the APPEND and IMMUTABLE flags
for a file on an
.Em EXT2FS
filesystem.
Without this option, the superuser or owner of the file can set and clear them.
With this option, only the superuser can set them, and they can't be cleared
if the securelevel is greater than 0.
See also
.Xr chflags 1 .
.It Cd option UFS_EXTATTR
This option enables Extended Attribute support for UFS filesystems.
.It Cd option UFS_EXTATTR_AUTOSTART
This option causes Extended Attributes to be started and enabled when each
UFS filesystem is mounted.
The attribute storage is expected to be (relative to mount point)
.Pa /.attribute/{system|user}/<attrname>
.It Cd option UFS_DIRHASH
This option enables using an in memory hash table to speed lookups
in large directories.
.El
.Ss Miscellaneous Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option PCIVERBOSE
Makes the boot process more verbose for PCI peripherals
(vendor names and other information is printed, etc.).
.It Cd option PCMCIAVERBOSE
Makes the boot process more verbose for PCMCIA peripherals.
.It Cd option MACOBIOVERBOSE
Makes the boot process more verbose for Mac OBIO peripherals.
.It Cd option APERTURE
Provide in-kernel support for controlling VGA framebuffer mapping
and PCI configuration registers by user-processes
(such as an X Window System server).
This option is supported on the
.Va alpha ,
.Va i386 ,
.Va macppc ,
and
.Va sparc64
architectures.
.It Cd option LKM
Enables support for loadable kernel modules.
See
.Xr lkm 4
for details.
.Em Note:
This option is not yet available on all architectures.
.It Cd option CRYPTO
Enables support for the kernel cryptographic framework.
See
.Xr crypto 9
for details.
While not IP specific, this option is usually used in conjunction with option
.Em IPSEC .
.It Cd option INSECURE
Hardwires the kernel security level at \-1.
This means that the system always runs in securelevel 0 mode, even when
running multiuser.
See
.Xr init 8
for details on the implications of this.
The kernel secure level may be manipulated by the superuser by altering the
.Em kern.securelevel
sysctl variable.
(It should be noted that the securelevel may only be lowered by a call from
process ID 1, i.e.,
.Xr init 8 . )
See also
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.It Cd option CCDNBUF=integer
The
.Xr ccd 4
device driver uses
.Dq component buffers
to distribute I/O requests to the components of a concatenated disk.
It keeps a freelist of buffer
headers in order to reduce use of the kernel memory allocator.
.Em CCDNBUF
is the number of buffer headers allocated on the freelist for
each component buffer.
It defaults to 8.
.It Cd option KMEMSTATS
The kernel memory allocator,
.Xr malloc 9 ,
will keep statistics on its performance if this option is enabled.
Unfortunately, this option therefore essentially disables
.Fn MALLOC
and
.Fn FREE
forms of the memory allocator, which are used to enhance the
performance of certain critical sections of code in the kernel.
This option therefore can lead to a significant decrease in the performance
of certain code in the kernel if enabled.
Examples of such code include the
.Fn namei
routine, the
.Xr ccd 4
driver,
the
.Xr ncr 4
driver, and much of the networking code.
Note that this option is silently turned on by the
.Em DEBUG
option.
.It Cd option BOOT_CONFIG
Adds support for the
.Fl c
boot option (User Kernel Config).
Allows modification of kernel settings (e.g., device parameters) before
booting the system.
.It Cd option RAID_AUTOCONFIG
Adds support for auto-configuring the RAIDframe devices during the kernel
initialization.
See
.Xr raid 4
and
.Xr raidctl 8
for details.
.It Cd option UVM_SWAP_ENCRYPT
Enables kernel support for encrypting pages that are written out to
swap storage.
Swap encryption prevents sensitive data from remaining
on the disk even after the operating system has been shut down.
This option should be turned on if cryptographic filesystems are used.
The sysctl variable
.Em vm.swapencrypt.enable
controls its behaviour.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd option USER_PCICONF
Enables the user level access to the PCI bus configuration space
through ioctls on the
.Pa /dev/pci
device.
It's used by the
.Xr XFree86 1
server on some architectures.
See
.Xr pci 4
for details.
.It Cd option PCIAGP
Enables
.Xr ioctl 2
access to the AGP GART on the supported chipsets.
It's used by the
.Xr XFree86 1
server on some architectures.
See
.Xr vga 4
for details.
.It Cd option INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE
Includes the configuration file given to
.Xr config 8
in the kernel image. It can be recovered later by executing
.Em strings -n4 /bsd | sed -n 's/^=CF=//p'
.El
.Ss Networking Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option IPFORWARDING
Enables IP routing behavior.
With this option enabled, the machine
will forward IP datagrams between its interfaces that are destined for
other machines.
Note that even without this option, the kernel will
still forward some packets (such as source routed packets) -- removing
.Em IPFORWARDING
is insufficient to stop all routing through a bastion host on a
firewall -- source routing is controlled independently.
Note that IP
forwarding may be turned on and off independently of the setting of the
.Em IPFORWARDING
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
is 1, IP forwarding is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd option MROUTING
Includes support for IP multicast routers.
.Em INET
should be set along with this.
Multicast routing is controlled by the
.Xr mrouted 8
daemon.
.It Cd option INET
Includes support for the TCP/IP protocol stack.
This option is currently required.
See
.Xr inet 4
for details.
.It Cd option INET6
Includes support for the
.Tn IPv6
protocol stack.
See
.Xr inet6 4
for details.
Unlike
.Em INET ,
.Em INET6
enables multicast routing code as well.
This option requires
.Em INET
at this moment, but it should not.
.It Cd option ND6_DEBUG
The option sets the default value of
.Em net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_debug
to 1,
for debugging IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol handling.
See
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd option IPX, IPXIP
Include support for Internetwork Packet Exchange protocol commonly in
use by
.Tn Novell NetWare .
.It Cd option NETATALK
Include kernel support for the AppleTalk family of protocols.
This suite of supporting code is sometimes called
.Em netatalk
support.
.It Cd option TCP_COMPAT_42
Use of this option is
.Em extremely
discouraged, so it should not be enabled.
If any other machines on the network require enabling this, it's
recommended that
.Em they
be disconnected from the network.
.Pp
TCP bug compatibility with
.Bx 4.2 .
In
.Bx 4.2 ,
TCP sequence numbers
were 32-bit signed values.
Modern implementations of TCP use unsigned values.
This option clamps the initial sequence number to start in
the range 2^31 rather than the full unsigned range of 2^32.
Also, under
.Bx 4.2 ,
keepalive packets must contain at least one byte or else
the remote end will not respond.
.It Cd option TCP_SACK
Turns on selective acknowledgements.
Additional information about
segments already received can be transmitted back to the sender,
thus indicating segments that have been lost and allowing for
a swifter recovery.
Both communication endpoints need to support
.Em SACK .
The fallback behaviour is NewReno fast recovery phase, which allows
one lost segment to be recovered per round trip time.
When more than one segment has been dropped per window, the transmission can
continue without waiting for a retransmission timeout.
.It Cd option TCP_FACK
Turns on forward acknowledgements allowing a more precise estimate of
outstanding data during the fast recovery phase by using
.Em SACK
information.
This option can only be used together with
.Em TCP_SACK .
.It Cd option TCP_ECN
Turns on Explicit Congestion Notification (RFC 3168).
.Em ECN
allows intermediate routers to use the Congestion Experienced
codepoint in the IP header as an indication of congestion, and allows
TCP to adjust the transmission rate using this signal.
Both communication endpoints negotiate enabling
.Em ECN
functionality at the TCP connection establishment.
.It Cd option TCP_SIGNATURE
Turns on support for the TCP MD5 Signature option (RFC 2385).
This is used by
Internet backbone routers to provide per-packet authentication for the TCP
packets used to communicate BGP routing information.
You will also need a
routing daemon that supports this option in order to actually use it.
.It Cd option PPP_FILTER
This option turns on
.Xr pcap 3
based filtering for ppp connections.
This option is used by
.Xr pppd 8
which needs to be compiled with
.Em PPP_FILTER
defined (the current default).
.It Cd option PPP_BSDCOMP
Enables BSD compressor for PPP connections.
.It Cd option PPP_DEFLATE
For use in conjunction with PPP_BSDCOMP; provides an interface to zlib for PPP
for deflate compression/decompression.
.It Cd option IPSEC
This option enables IP security protocol support.
See
.Xr ipsec 4
for more details.
.It Cd option ENCDEBUG
This option enables debugging information to be conditionally logged
in case IPSEC encounters errors.
The option
.Em IPSEC
is required along with this option.
Debug logging can be turned on/off through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.encdebug
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.ipsec.encap.encdebug
is 1, debug logging is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd option KEY
Enables PFKEYv2 (RFC 2367) support.
While not IP specific, this option is usually used in conjunction with option
.Em IPSEC .
.It Cd option ALTQ
Enables ALTQ (Alternate Queuing).
See
.Xr pfctl 8
and
.Xr pf.conf 5
to set up the interface transmission rate and queueing disciplines.
.Em ALTQ_CBQ ,
.Em ALTQ_RED ,
.Em ALTQ_PRIQ
and
.Em ALTQ_HFSC
are enabled by default with option
.Em ALTQ
in
.Ox .
See
.Xr altq 9
for details on ALTQ.
.It Cd option ALTQ_RIO
Enables ALTQ's RIO (RED with In/Out) module.
The original RIO has 2 sets of RED parameters; one for in-profile
packets and the other for out-of-profile packets.
At the ingress of the network, profile meters tag packets as IN or
OUT based on contracted profiles for customers.
Inside the network, IN packets receive preferential treatment by
the RIO dropper.
ALTQ/RIO has 3 drop precedence levels defined for the Assured Forwarding
PHB of DiffServ (RFC 2597).
.It Cd option ALTQ_NOPCC
Disables use of processor cycle counter (e.g., Pentium TSC on i386 and
PCC on alpha) to measure time in ALTQ.
This option should be defined for a non-Pentium i386 CPU which does not
have TSC, SMP (per-CPU counters are not in sync), or power management
which affects processor cycle counter.
.El
.Ss SCSI Subsystem Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option SCSITERSE
Terser SCSI error messages.
This omits the table for decoding ASC/ASCQ info, saving about 30KB.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG
Enable printing of SCSI subsystem debugging info to the console.
Each of
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL ,
.Em SCSIDEBUG_BUSES ,
.Em SCSIDEBUG_TARGETS
and
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LUNS
must have non-zero values for any debugging info to be printed.
Only
.Em SCSI_DEBUG_LEVEL
has a default value that is non-zero.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL=value
Define which of the four levels of debugging info are printed.
Each bit enables a level, and multiple levels are specified by setting multiple
bits.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0x0010	(SDEV_DB1) SCSI commands, errors, and data
0x0020	(SDEV_DB2) routine flow
0x0040	(SDEV_DB3) routine internals
0x0080	(SDEV_DB4) miscellaneous addition debugging
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL
is undefined, a value of 0x0030 (SDEV_DB1|SDEV_DB2) is used.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_BUSES=value
Define which SCSI buses will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding bus.
e.g. a value of 0x1 enables debug info for bus 0.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_TARGETS=value
Define which SCSI targets will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding target.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_LUNS=value
Define which SCSI luns will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding lun.
.It Cd option SCSIFORCELUN_BUSES=value
Define which SCSI buses will do full lun scanning.
.Em SCSIFORCELUN_TARGETS
must also be set to a non-zero value for this option to take effect.
Each bit enables a full lun scan for the corresponding SCSI bus.
The lun scan normally terminates if identical INQUIRY data is seen for
lun 0 and another lun, as this usually means the target cannot
distinguish between different luns.
But some devices (e.g. some external RAID devices) can legitimately
supply identical INQUIRY data for several luns.
.It Cd option SCSIFORCELUN_TARGETS=value
Define which SCSI targets will do full lun scanning.
.Em SCSIFORCELUN_BUSES
must also be set to a non-zero value for this option to have any
effect.
Each bit enables a full lun scan for the corresponding target on the
buses specified by
.Em SCSIFORCELUN_BUSES.
.El
.Ss System V IPC Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option SYSVMSG
Includes support for
.At V
style message queues.
See
.Xr msgctl 2 ,
.Xr msgget 2 ,
.Xr msgrcv 2 ,
.Xr msgsnd 2 .
.It Cd option SYSVSEM
Includes support for
.At V
style semaphores.
See
.Xr semctl 2 ,
.Xr semget 2 ,
.Xr semop 2 .
.It Cd option VFORK_SHM
Allows for evil things with
.Xr vfork 2 .
Normally, doing anything else after a vfork than
.Xr execve 2
family call or
.Xr _exit 2
is undefined.
With this option, the old-fashioned behaviour of the
child and parent sharing the memory until the lock is
released is restored.
This will break on some arches.
.It Cd option SYSVSHM
Includes support for
.At V
style shared memory.
See
.Xr shmat 2 ,
.Xr shmctl 2 ,
.Xr shmdt 2 ,
.Xr shmget 2 .
.It Cd option SHMMAXPGS=value
Sets the maximum number of
.At V
style shared memory pages that are available through the
.Xr shmget 2
system call.
Default value is 1024 on most architectures.
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the default.
.It Cd option SEMMNI=value
Number of semaphore identifiers (also called semaphore handles
and semaphore sets) available in the system.
Default value is 10.
The kernel allocates memory for the control structures at startup,
so arbitrarily large values should be avoided.
.It Cd option SEMMNS=value
Maximum number of semaphores in all sets in the system.
Default value is 60.
.It Cd option SEMMNU=value
Maximum number of semaphore undo structures in the system.
Default value is 30.
.It Cd option SEMUME=value
Maximum number of per-process undo operation entries in the
system.
Semaphore undo operations are invoked by the kernel when
.Xr semop 2
is called with the SEM_UNDO flag and the process holding
the semaphores terminates unexpectedly.
Default value is 10.
.El
.Ss Operation Related Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES=value
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES_MIN=value
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES_MAX=value
Size of kernel malloc area in PAGE_SIZE-sized logical pages.
This area is covered by the kernel submap
.Em kmem_map .
The kernel attempts to auto-size this map based on the amount of
physical memory in the system.
Platform-specific code may place bounds on this computed size,
which may be viewed with the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Em vm.nkmempages .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/param.h
for the default upper and lower bounds.
The related options
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MIN
and
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MAX
allow the bounds to be overridden in the kernel configuration file.
These options are provided in the event the computed value is
insufficient resulting in an
.Dq out of space in kmem_map
panic.
.It Cd option NBUF=value
.It Cd option BUFPAGES=value
These options set the number of pages available for the buffer cache.
Their default value is a machine dependent value, often calculated as
between 5% and 10% of total available RAM.
.It Cd option DUMMY_NOPS
This option is supported on the i386 architecture.
When enabled, it speeds up interrupt processing by removing delays
while accessing the interrupt controller.
Care should be taken when using this option.
.It Cd option APM_NOPRINT
This option is supported on the i386 architecture.
When enabled, kernel messages regarding the status of the automatic power
management system
.Tn ( APM )
are suppressed.
.Tn APM
status can still be obtained using
.Xr apm 8
and/or
.Xr apmd 8 .
.It Cd option \&"TIMEZONE=value\&"
.Ar value
indicates the timezone offset of hardware realtime clock device, in minutes,
from UTC.
It is useful when hardware realtime clock device is configured with local time,
when dual-booting
.Ox
with other operating systems on a single machine.
For instance, if hardware realtime clock is set to Tokyo time,
.Ar value
should be
.Li \&-540
as Tokyo local time is 9 hours ahead of UTC.
Double quotes are needed when specifying a negative
.Ar value .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

Each of

Only
.Em SCSI_DEBUG_LEVEL
has a default value that is non-zero.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL=value
Define which of the four levels of debugging info are printed.
Each bit enables a level, and multiple levels are specified by setting multiple
bits.

If
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL
is undefined, a value of 0x0030 (SDEV_DB1|SDEV_DB2) is used.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_BUSES=value
Define which SCSI buses will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding bus.
e.g. a value of 0x1 enables debug info for bus 0.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_TARGETS=value
Define which SCSI targets will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding target.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_LUNS=value
Define which SCSI luns will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding lun.
.It Cd option SCSIFORCELUN_BUSES=value
Define which SCSI buses will do full lun scanning.
.Em SCSIFORCELUN_TARGETS
must also be set to a non-zero value for this option to take effect.
Each bit enables a full lun scan for the corresponding SCSI bus.
The lun scan normally terminates if identical INQUIRY data is seen for
lun 0 and another lun, as this usually means the target cannot
distinguish between different luns.
But some devices (e.g. some external RAID devices) can legitimately
supply identical INQUIRY data for several luns.
.It Cd option SCSIFORCELUN_TARGETS=value
Define which SCSI targets will do full lun scanning.
.Em SCSIFORCELUN_BUSES
must also be set to a non-zero value for this option to have any
effect.
Each bit enables a full lun scan for the corresponding target on the
buses specified by
.Em SCSIFORCELUN_BUSES.

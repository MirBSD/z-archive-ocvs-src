@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

.Sh NAME
.Nm uk
.Nd SCSI user-level driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uk* at scsibus? target ? lun ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for a
process to address devices on the SCSI bus for which there is no configured
driver.
.Pp
A SCSI adapter must also be separately configured into the system
before this driver makes sense.
.Sh IOCTLS
The
.Nm
driver has no ioctls of its own but rather acts as a medium for the
generic
.Xr scsi 4
ioctls.
These are described in
.Aq Pa sys/scsiio.h .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/uk[0-255] -compact
.It Pa /dev/uk[0-255]
uk{x} is the 'xth' unknown device found.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
All
.Xr scsi 4
debug ioctls work on
.Nm
devices.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr ch 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr ss 4 ,
.Xr \&st 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in 386BSD 0.1

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.4
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

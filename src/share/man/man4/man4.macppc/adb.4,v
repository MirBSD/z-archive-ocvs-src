.Dt ADB 4 macppc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm adb
.Nd Apple Desktop Bus driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "adb at macobio?"
.Cd "abtn* at adb?"
.Cd "aed* at adb?"
.Cd "akbd* at adb ?"
.Cd "ams* at adb?"
.Cd "apm0 at adb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Apple Desktop Bus
.Pq Tn ADB
is the single-master, multiple-slave, low-speed serial bus
interface used by Macintosh computers to connect input devices
such as keyboards, mice, trackballs, and graphics tablets
to the machine.
.Pp
Originally developed for the Mac68K port, the
.Nm
driver was heavily modified when it was ported to the PowerPC architecture.
During this port it seems that the original
.Nm
event device was split into many smaller subsystems, namely:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Apple Event Device driver
.Pq Xr aed 4 .
.It
Apple Keyboard driver
.Pq Xr akbd 4 .
.It
Apple Mouse Support driver
.Pq Xr ams 4 .
.El
.Pp
New
.Nm
devices such as the Apple Brightness / Volume Control Button
.Pq Xr abtn 4
and some energy control
.Pq Xr apm 4
were added to the PowerPC port later to complement the ADB system.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr abtn 4 ,
.Xr aed 4 ,
.Xr akbd 4 ,
.Xr ams 4 ,
.Xr apm 4 ,
.Xr intro 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 0.9 .
It has been under development ever since.
The original
.Nm adb
manpage was written by Colin Wood for
.Nx
/ Mac68K.
.Sh AUTHORS
Original ADB support was written by Bradley A. Grantham.
The direct ADB routines were written by John P. Wittkoski.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

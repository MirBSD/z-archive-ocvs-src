.Sh NAME
.Nm sti
.Nd HP Standard Text Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sti*	at mainbus0 irq ?"
.\" .Cd "sti*	at pci? device ? function ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay*	at sti? console ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
was created by HP to provide uniform frame-buffer access operations
for their 9000/300 and 9000/700 series of workstations.
Implementation consists of a set of functions burnt in to the PROM
on the card and providing the following set of functions (see below
for PROM revision history on functions supported by particular PROM
revision):
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Initialize graphics.
.It
State management.
.It
Print a character onto the screen using currently selected font.
.It
Copy a region of the frame-buffer to another location.
.It
Self testing.
.It
Exception handling.
.It
Frame-buffer configuration enquiry.
.It
Setting colour-map entry.
.It
DMA parameters.
.It
Flow control.
.It
User timing.
.It
Processing management.
.It
Miscellaneous utility functions.
.El
.Pp
There are two modes for accessing the PROM:
.Dq byte
and
.Dq word
mode.
In
.Dq byte
mode each 4-byte word contains only the low-ordered big-endian
byte of data; i.e., to compose one word of data 4 words should be read
and low-ordered bytes of those should be shifted correspondingly.
In
.Dq word
mode each word contains all 4 bytes of valid data.
.Pp

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

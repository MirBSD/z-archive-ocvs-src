.Sh NAME
.Nm uperf
.Nd performance counters driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uperf* at ebus?"
.Cd "uperf* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some UltraSPARC host bridges provide performance counters on their host
bridges.
The counters are a part of the system controller chip (usc, dsc, or qsc).
On PCI machines the system controller shows up as a device on the EBUS, but
on SBUS machines the system controller exists in SBUS space.
The
.Nm
driver provides access to these counters via
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh IOCTLS
All of the ioctl calls supported by the
.Nm
driver take the following structure as an argument:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct uperf_io {
	int cnt_flags;
	int cnt_src0;
	int cnt_src1;
	u_int32_t cnt_val0;
	u_int32_t cnt_val1;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa cnt_flags
field specifies which counters are being operated on and is a bit mask
of
.Fa UPERF_CNT0
and/or
.Fa UPERF_CNT1 .
.Pp
The
.Fa cnt_src0
and
.Fa cnt_src1
fields specify the source for the counter.
Not all counters support monitoring all sources and specifying an invalid
source for a counter to monitor will result in an error.
The sources are specified below:
.Pp
.Bl -column "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "description" -offset indent
.It Em UPERFSRC_SYSCK Ta "system clock ticks"
.It Em UPERFSRC_PRALL Ta "all p-requests"

.El
.Pp
The
.Fa cnt_val0

Software using this interface should be prepared to handle the counters
rolling over.

device responds to the following

calls, which are defined in
.Aq Pa dev/sun/uperfio.h .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width UPIO_GCNTSRC
.It Dv UPIO_GCNTSRC
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Retrieve the source the counters are monitoring.
The
.Fa cnt_flags
is a bit mask for which of the counters is to be fetched.
The result is returned in
.Fa cnt_src0
and/or
.Fa cnt_src1 .
.It Dv UPIO_SCNTSRC
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Set the source the counters should monitor.
This call also clears the current value of the counters that are set.
The
.Fa cnt_flags
is a bit mask for which of the counters is to be set.
The
.Fa cnt_src0
and/or
.Fa cnt_src1
fields specify the source to be set for the respective counter.
.It Dv UPIO_CLRCNT
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Clear the counters specified in
.Fa cnt_flags .
.It Dv UPIO_GETCNT
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Retrieve the value for the counters specified in
.Fa cnt_flags .
The values are returned in
.Fa cnt_val0
and/or
.Fa cnt_val1 .

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

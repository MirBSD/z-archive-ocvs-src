.Sh NAME
.Nm magma
.Nd Magma Sp Serial/Parallel board device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "magma? at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "mtty? at magma?"
.Cd "mbpp? at magma?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to Magma LC2+1Sp, 2+1Sp, 4+1Sp, 8+2Sp,
4Sp, 8Sp, 12Sp, 16Sp, 1P, 2P, and 2+1HS boards.
These boards are based around the Cirrus Logic CD1400 serial/parallel
communications engine and the Cirrus Logic CD1190 parallel communications
engine.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---+---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   +-------------------> dialout (on tty ports)
      |   |   |
      |   |   +-----------------------> unused
      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
All tty ports have full automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control available
and a 12 byte FIFO on the chip in each direction so errors should be minimal.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "mtty%d%x: ring buffer overflow"
Incoming characters have been discarded due to a buffer overflow.
This is caused by the process in control of the device not reading characters
fast enough.
If need be you can make the ring buffer bigger by changing the
\fIMAGMA_RBUF_SIZE\fR #define to something bigger, but it should be a multiple
of two.
.It "mtty%d%x: fifo overflow"
Incoming characters have been discarded due to a CD1400 channel overrun.
This is caused by interrupts not being serviced sufficiently quickly to prevent
the 12 byte receive FIFO on a serial channel from overflowing.
Reducing the value of either the \fIMTTY_RX_FIFO_THRESHOLD\fR or
\fIMTTY_RX_DTR_THRESHOLD\fR #define's to something smaller may help slow
machines avoid this problem.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/bpp[0-3][0-1] -compact
.It /dev/tty[mno][0-f]
Serial ports
.It /dev/bpp[mno][0-1]
Parallel ports
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by
.An Iain Hibbert Aq plunky@@skate.demon.co.uk
.Sh HISTORY
The driver was loosely based upon the
.Xr cy 4
Cyclades Cyclom device driver written
by Andrew Herbert and Timo Rossi.
.Sh TODO
CD1190 parallel support
.Pp
bpp input
.Pp
Dialout (cua) devices are not yet supported.
.Pp
mdmbuf is unsupported
.Pp
automatic XON/XOFF handshaking could be implemented fairly easily.
.Pp
it would be good if the tty port waited for the FIFO to empty before allowing
a close, so that I could turn off the channel interrupts at that time.
It can be done.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

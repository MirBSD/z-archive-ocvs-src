.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SBus (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "stty* at spif?"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931)
based around the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the
Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   |   +---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---------------> unused
      |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   +-------------------> dialout (on tty ports)
      |   |   |
      |   |   +-----------------------> unused
      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif%d: ccr timeout"
A timeout occurred while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty%d-%d: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.
.El
.Sh FILES

.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by 
.An Jason Wright Aq jason@@thought.net ,
and is heavily based on the
.Xr magma 4
driver written by
.An Iain Hibbert Aq plunky@@skate.demon.co.uk .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was first supported in
.Ox 3.1 .
.Sh TODO
The parallel port is not supported yet.
.Pp
Dialout (cua) devices are not yet supported.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

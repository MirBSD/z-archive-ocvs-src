.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm creator
.Nd accelerated color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "creator* at mainbus0 flags 0x0"
.Cd "creator* at upa0 flags 0x0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at creator?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Creator, Creator 3D and Elite 3D UPA
are color frame buffers, with graphics acceleration, available for most
of the UltraSPARC workstations with UPA or PCI slots.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces those frame buffers with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points but makes its functions
available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
By default hardware acceleration is used to erase the screen and
scroll text.  
By setting 
.Ar flags
to 
.Ar 1
(via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 )
this acceleration can be disabled.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

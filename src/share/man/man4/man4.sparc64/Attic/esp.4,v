.Sh NAME
.Nm esp
.Nd ESP NCR 53c94 on-board or SBus SCSI controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dma* at sbus? slot ? offset ?             " Pq "SBus SCSI"
.Cd "esp* at dma? flags 0x0000                 " Pq "two flavours"
.Cd "esp* at sbus? slot ? offset ? flags 0x0000" Pq "depending on model"
.Cd "scsibus* at esp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is an on-board or SBus SCSI controller based on the NCR 53c94 chip, found
on some
.Tn Sun
ULTRAsparc workstations.
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width "Bits XX-XX" -compact
.It Bits 0-7
Disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It Bits 8-15
Disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.
Targets 4 through 7 typically have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
that tape devices normally have one of these targets.
Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus to operate
acceptably.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm iy
.Nd Intel i82595 Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iy0 at isa? port 0x360 irq 7"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm iy
device driver supports the Ether-Express PRO/10 card, and might support
other ISA cards using the same chip.
.Pp
Other models of Intel network cards are supported by the
.Xr fxp 4
and
.Xr ie 4
drivers.
.Pp
Various models of these cards come with a different assortment of
connectors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It AUI/DIX
Standard 15 pin connector
.It 10Base2
BNC, also known as thin-net
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The default port to use is the port the card autodetects at
.Em ifconfig up
time.
To choose an alternative port, use the following flag combinations with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It -link0 -link1
Use the autodetected port (default).
.It -link0 \ link1
Use the BNC port.
.It \ link0 -link1
Use the AUI port.
.It \ link0 \ link1
Use the UTP port.
.El
.Sh NOTES
The EtherExpress PRO card has no jumpers to set the address.
Intel supplies software to set the address of the card in software.
You have to hardwire this address in your kernel configuration file.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

.Sh NAME
.Nm osiop
.Nd Symbios/NCR 53C710 SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "osiop* at gsc? irq 9                  " Pq "hppa"
.Cd "osiop0 at pcctwo0 offset 0x47000 ipl 2" Pq "mvme88k"
.Cd "scsibus* at osiop?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C710
.Tn SCSI
controller chip.
.Pp
The
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C700
.Tn SCSI
controller is handled by the
.Xr oosiop 4
driver, while the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C8xx
.Tn PCI
.Tn SCSI
host adapters are handled by the
.Xr siop 4
driver.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Sy flags
for use in
.Xr config 8
files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "bits 8-15:"
.It bits 0-7 :
disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 8-15 :
disable synchronous negotiation for
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 16 :
disable DMA interrupts
.El
.Pp
.Qq Target
is synonymous with
.Tn SCSI
ID number.
.Pp
Note that
.Tn SCSI
tape drives should be allowed to perform disconnect/reselect or performance
will suffer.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
The original
.Tn NCR
53C710
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.0
amiga port, and
.An Izumi Tsutsui Aq tsutsui@@ceres.dti.ne.jp
modified the driver and made it machine-independent.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

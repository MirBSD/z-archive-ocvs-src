.Sh NAME
.Nm sk ,
.Nm skc
.Nd SysKonnect SK-984x PCI Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "skc* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "sk* at skc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm sk
driver provides support for the SysKonnect SK-984x series PCI
Gigabit Ethernet adapters, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
SK-9821 SK-NET GE-T single port, copper adapter
.It
SK-9822 SK-NET GE-T dual port, copper adapter
.It
SK-9841 SK-NET GE-LX single port, single mode fiber adapter
.It
SK-9842 SK-NET GE-LX dual port, single mode fiber adapter
.It
SK-9843 SK-NET GE-SX single port, multimode fiber adapter
.It
SK-9844 SK-NET GE-SX dual port, multimode fiber adapter
.El
.Pp
The SysKonnect adapters consist of two main components: the XaQti Corp.
XMAC II Gigabit MAC (sk) and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC (skc).
The XMAC provides the Gigabit MAC and PHY support while the GEnesis
provides an interface to the PCI bus, DMA support, packet buffering
and arbitration.
The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously,
allowing dual-port NIC configurations.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver configures dual port SysKonnect adapters such that each XMAC
is treated as a separate logical network interface.
Both ports can operate independently of each other and can be connected
to separate networks.
The SysKonnect driver software currently only uses the second port on
dual port adapters for failover purposes: if the link
on the primary port fails, the SysKonnect driver will automatically
switch traffic onto the second port.
.Pp
The XaQti XMAC II supports full and half duplex operation with
autonegotiation.
The XMAC also supports unlimited frame sizes.
Support for jumbo frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
Hardware TCP/IP checksum offloading for IPv4 is supported.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseT Cm mediaopt
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by your card try
.Ic ifconfig -m <device> .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig -m sk0 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sk%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "sk%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "sk%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm lm
.Nd National Semiconductor LM78, LM79 and compatible hardware monitors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lm0 at isa? port 0x290"
.Cd "lm1 at isa? port 0x280"
.Cd "lm2 at isa? port 0x310"
.\" .Cd "lm0 at pnpbios0 index ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn National Semiconductor
LM series hardware monitors and register compatible chips to be used with
the
.Xr sysctl 3
interface.
.Pp
Most supported devices possess 11 sensors:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "IN0" Ta "uV DC" Ta "Core voltage"
.It Li "IN1" Ta "uV DC" Ta "Unknown"
.It Li "IN2" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+3.3V"
.It Li "IN3" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+5V"
.It Li "IN4" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+12V"
.It Li "IN5" Ta "uV DC" Ta "-12V"
.It Li "IN6" Ta "uV DC" Ta "-5V"
.It Li "Temp" Ta "uK" Ta "Motherboard Temperature"
.It Li "Fan0" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan"
.It Li "Fan1" Ta "RPM" Ta "Chassis Fan"
.It Li "Fan2" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan"
.El
.Pp
For some devices (most Winbond devices) sensors names and numbers will be
different.
.Pp
Due to hardware limitations, fresh sensor data is only available every
1.5 seconds.
.Sh HARDWARE
Chips supported by the
.Nm
driver include:

.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 ,
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 3.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Squier
and ported to
.Ox 3.4
by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq grange@@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
Interrupt support is unimplemented.
.Pp
There are currently no known pnpbios IDs assigned to LM chips.

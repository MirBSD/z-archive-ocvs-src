@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Cd "yds* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"

.Pp
The flags can be used to pass additional information
to the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
A value of 0x1000 forces the driver to disable the Sound Blaster
legacy mode.
This is needed to make the floppy work on some machines
but is disabled by default because it is known to break
.Xr apm 4
support.

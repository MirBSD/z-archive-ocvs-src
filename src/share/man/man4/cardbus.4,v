.Sh NAME
.Nm cardbus ,
.Nm cbb
.Nd introduction to CardBus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cbb*      at pci? dev? function ?"
.Cd "cardslot* at cbb? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "cardbus*  at cardslot?"
.Cd "pcmcia*   at cardslot?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
provides machine-independent bus support and drivers for CardBus devices.
.Pp
The flags are used with cardslot definition.
The lowest order (rightmost)
bit of flags defines the PC Card attach sequence at
boot-time.
When the bit is set, a PC Card in the slot is probed and
attached immediately.
However, the PC Card is probed after the kernel thread wakes up.
If a PC Card is used as a boot device (e.g., CF
card or network card), this bit should be set to 1.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Ox
includes the following machine-independent CardBus
drivers, sorted by function and driver name:
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset ind -compact
.It Xr dc 4
Intel 21143 and Xircom X3201-based Ethernet interfaces.
.It Xr fxp 4
Intel PRO/100 CardBus II Ethernet interfaces.
.It Xr rl 4
RealTek 8129/8139-based Ethernet interfaces.
.It Xr xl 4
3Com 3c575 and 3c656-based Ethernet interfaces.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm bha
.Nd Buslogic SCSI adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bha0 at isa? port 0x330 irq ? drq ?"
.Cd "bha1 at isa? port 0x334 irq ? drq ?"
.Cd "bha* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at bha?"
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm bha
driver supports the following
.Tn Buslogic
.Tn SCSI
adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Tn Buslogic ISA BT-445
.It Tn Buslogic EISA BT-74x
(supported in ISA compatibility mode only)
.It Tn Buslogic PCI BT-9[45][68]

.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr ss 4 ,
.Xr \&st 4 ,
.Xr uk 4
.Sh HISTORY
In
.Ox 3.0
and earlier, this driver was named
.Nm bt
but was renamed to
.Nm bha
in later releases.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Tn Buslogic
BT-930 is not supported in this driver.
.Pp
The
.Tn Buslogic
BT-445S has a problem in early hardware and firmware revisions
which prevents proper operation on a system with more than 16MB of RAM.
Hardware revision D and firmware revision 3.37 should be considered minimum
requirements for using this board on systems configured in this manner.

@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

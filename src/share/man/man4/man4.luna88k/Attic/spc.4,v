@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

1.1.1.1
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

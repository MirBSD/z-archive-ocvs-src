@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

.Sh NAME
.Nm power
.Nd Power button and power fail support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "power0 at mainbus?"
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Tn HP PA-RISC
machines support power failure detection in different forms:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Dq soft
power button;
.It
power failure interrupt.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver tries it's best at determining the power failure condition
that is a result of power button being depressed or a power supply
system failure or a similar condition.
Upon detection of any of the beforementioned conditions it tries to
gracefully (if possible) shutdown the system through a call to
.Xr boot 9
function.
.Pp
On systems equipped with
.Xr lasi 4
bus adapter we find a
.Dq soft
power buttun which upon depression gives us a signal in the
.Dq power register
and thus polling periodically we detect the event.
Since that bit comes directly from the power button without any
dampenning we perform a second long delay thus
quick transitions off and on will
.Em not
result in a shutdown.
.Pp
On modern systems an interruption is signalled upon the power
button depression and thus this avoids polling and does not
require (as being implemented in hardware) dampenning.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr lasi 4 ,
.Xr boot 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Ox 3.4 .

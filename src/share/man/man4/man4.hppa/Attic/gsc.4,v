.Sh NAME
.Nm gsc
.Nd General System Connect bus on HP9000 series 700 workstations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gsc* at lasi?"
.Cd "gsc* at asp?"
.Cd "gsc* at wax?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the core I/O bus for all HP9000/700 series workstations.
All I/O subsystems connect to this bus.
The devices can be either on separate chips, expansion
cards or on an integrated megacell, like the LASI MBA.
.Pp
The
.Tn GSC
bus is a 32-bit wide, address and data multiplexed bus.
In its "standard" implementation it has a maximum throughput of 160MB/s,
the "2x" implementation reaches up to 250MB/s.
Some HPPA CPUs directly attach to this bus, namely the PA7100LC and PA7300LC.
.Pp
As for the expansion cards, there are different form-factors, depending on
bus-speed (standard or 2x) and specific models.
The standard formfactor is the "EISA form-factor"; cards that look like
typical EISA cards with a different connector (100-pin female EBBL).
The Series 712 have their own special type
of GSC expansion cards, called the "GIO form-factor", which is quite small and
mostly has only one VLSI chip on it (in most cases LASI/WAX).
Newer systems sometimes feature the "HSC formfactor", which is a 1U-VME
card-like expansion card with a 100-pin male pin+socket connector.
Mixing cards with different speeds is supported but downgrades
the performance of the whole I/O-subsystem. 
.Pp
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
The system includes machine-dependent
.Tn GSC
drivers, sorted by driver name:
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It Xr com 4
RS-232 ports.
.It Xr gsckbc 4
PC-style keyboard controller.
.It Xr harmony 4
CS4215/AD1849 audio.
.It Xr hil 4

.It Xr ie 4
Intel i82596 DX/CA 32-bit LAN coprocessor.
.It Xr lpt 4

.It Xr osiop 4

.El
.Pp
Some of these 
.Tn GSC
devices also have
.Tn PCI
,
.Tn EISA 
or
.Tn ISA 
equivalents.
These are listed in
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr eisa 4 ,
or
.Xr isa 4 ,

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

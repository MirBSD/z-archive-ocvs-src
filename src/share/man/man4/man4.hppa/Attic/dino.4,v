.Sh BUGS
.Nm
bridges of revision earlier than three may exhibit data corruption on DMA.
This hardware bug does not affect
.Nm cujo

See HP Service Note Numbers A4190A-01 and A4191A-01 for more details.
Systems affected are those shipped before Aug 20, 1997 and
of models: B132L, B160L, C160, C180, C200, C240.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

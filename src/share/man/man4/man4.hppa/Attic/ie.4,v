.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd Intel i82596 DX/CA LAN coprocessor as found in HP9000 workstations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ie0 at gsc? irq 8"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the 
.Tn Intel
i82596 DX/CA 32-bit
Local Area Network Coprocessor for Ethernet.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Pp
The i82596 comes basically in two different flavors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width i82596DXxxx
.It i82596DX
Systems with an ASP or WAX Main Bus Adapter (MBA), e.g. 720, 735 etc.
These types of systems generally have only AUI or BNC and AUI connectors at
the back.
On the models with both you usually have to switch a big
jumper-block on the mainboard to choose which one to activate.
.It i82596CA
Systems with LASI MBA, e.g. 712/*, 715/100 have the i82596CA 
integrated on the LASI macrochip.
They usually have TP and AUI 
connectors and autodetect to which one the network is connected to.
.El
.Pp
By default, the system will select the media type automatically, but the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command can be used to force the media selection.
The media types are shown below:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxx -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 10base5
Use the AUI connector
.It media 10baseT
Use the twisted pair connector
.It media 10base2
Use the BNC connector
.El

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any

.Dt KSYMS 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksyms
.Nd kernel symbol table device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy pseudo-device Nm ksyms 1
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /dev/ksyms
device masquerades as an
.Em a.out
executable with the symbols from the running kernel as its
symbol segment.
Use of
.Pa /dev/ksyms
requires that the boot loader preserve the kernel symbols and place
them at the end of the kernel's address space.
.Pp
The
.Pa /dev/ksyms
device is used to look up the symbol table name list from the running
kernel.
Because it represents the running kernel it is guaranteed
to always be up to date even if the kernel file has been changed (or
is even non-existent).
It is most useful when used in conjunction with
.Xr nlist 3
or the
.Xr kvm 3
routines (note that
.Xr kvm_open 3
and
.Xr kvm_openfiles 3
will try
.Pa /dev/ksyms
automatically if the first parameter to them is the
.Dv NULL
pointer).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /dev/ksyms
.El
.Sh ERRORS
An open of
.Pa /dev/ksyms
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
An open was attempted with write permissions.
.It Bq Er ENXIO
No kernel symbols were saved by the boot loader (usually because
they were removed with
.Xr strip 1 ) .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kvm 3 ,
.Xr nlist 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa /dev/ksyms
device appeared in
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh BUGS
It is not possible to
.Xr mmap 2
.Pa /dev/ksyms
because the boot loader does not load the symbol table onto a page
boundary (so it is not page aligned).
If all the boot loaders were fixed,
.Xr mmap 2
support would be trivial.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.4
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

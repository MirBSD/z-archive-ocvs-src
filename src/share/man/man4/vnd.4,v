.Sh NAME
.Nm vnd
.Nd Vnode Disk Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device vnd 4"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a disk-like interface to a file.
This is useful for a variety of applications, including swap files and
building miniroot or floppy disk images.
There are two variants, the traditional
.Nm
that bypasses the buffercache and thus is suitable for swap on files, but
not for building disk-images, and the
.Nm svnd
("safe"
.Nm
) variant that goes
through the buffercache, thereby maintaining cache-coherency after the
block-device is closed which makes it suitable for creating disk images.
The latter is not good for swapping on, though.
.Pp
This document assumes that you're familiar with how to generate kernels,
how to properly configure disks and pseudo-devices in a kernel
configuration file.
.Pp
In order to compile in support for the
.Nm
, you must add a line similar
to the following to your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
pseudo-device	vnd	4	# vnode disk driver
.Ed
.Pp
The count argument is how many
.Nm vnds
memory is allocated for a boot time.
In this example, no more than 4
.Nm vnds
may be configured.
.Pp
There is a run-time utility that is used for configuring
.Nm vnds .
See
.Xr vnconfig 8
for more information.
.Sh FILES
/dev/{,r}{,s}vnd* - vnd device special files.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 5 ,
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
.Xr config 8 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr fdisk 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr vnconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The vnode disk driver was originally written at the University of
Utah.
The svnd variant was first seen in
.Ox 2.1 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not work if the file does not reside in a local filesystem.
However the
.Nm svnd
variant does.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

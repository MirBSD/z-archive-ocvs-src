.Nd 3Com EtherLink XL and Fast EtherLink XL Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xl* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "xl* at cardbus? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the 3Com EtherLink XL and Fast EtherLink XL family
of Ethernet cards, and embedded controllers based on the 3Com
.Dq boomerang
and
.Dq cyclone
bus master EtherLink XL chips.
This includes, among others, the following models:

.It 3C905C

.It 3C980
Fast EtherLink Server NIC
.It 3CSOHO
OfficeConnect Fast Ethernet NIC
.It 9201
NVidia nForce2 integrated 3Com 9201 (nForce2-ST, nForce2-GT)
.El
.Pp
It also supports embedded 3C905-TX and 3C905B-TX Ethernet hardware found
in certain Dell OptiPlex and Dell Precision desktop machines, as well as
some Dell Latitude laptop docking stations.
Other models of 3Com network cards are supported by the
.Xr ec 4 ,
.Xr eg 4 ,
.Xr el 4 ,
.Xr ep 4 ,
and
.Xr ie 4
drivers.
.Pp
Category 3, 4 or 5 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable should be used for
RJ-45 (10baseT), thick Ethernet coaxial (RG59 B/U, 50 ohm) for AUI/DIX,
and thin Ethernet coaxial (RG58 A/U or C/U, 50 ohm +/- 4) for BNC (10base2).
Some 3Com NICs also support MII connectors (switchable 10/100Mbps UTP).
The 3C905B-FX and other similar cards are capable of 100Mbps over fiber.
.Pp
The 3C985 series of Gigabit cards are supported by the
.Xr ti 4
driver.
.Pp
Hardware TCP/IP checksum offloading for IPv4 is supported on the 3C905B.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of media type and options.
Note that this media type is only available with
adapters that have external PHYs or built-in autonegotiation logic.
For 3C900 and 3C900B adapters, the driver
will choose the mode specified in the EEPROM.
You can change this by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm media No 100baseFX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
For those cards that support it, force full-duplex 100Mbps operation over fiber.
.It Cm media No 100baseFX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
For those cards that support it, force half-duplex 100Mbps operation over fiber.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10baseT (UTP) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10baseT (UTP) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10base5
Set 10base5 (thick-net) operation (half-duplex only).
.It Cm media No 10base2
Set 10base2 (thin-net) operation (half-duplex only).
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by your card try
.Ic ifconfig -m <device> .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig -m xl0 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "xl%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "xl%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "xl%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "xl%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "xl%d: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
.It "xl%d: command never completed!"
Some commands issued to the 3C90x ASIC take time to complete: the
driver is supposed to wait until the
.Dq command in progress
bit in the status register clears before continuing.
In rare instances, this bit may not clear.
To avoid getting caught in an infinite wait loop,
the driver only polls the bit a finite number of times before
giving up, at which point it issues this message.
This message may be printed during driver initialization on slower machines.
If you see this message but the driver continues to function normally, the
message can probably be ignored.
.It "xl%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to 3C905B adapters, which support power management.
Some operating systems place the 3C905B in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSs fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The 3C905B loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the
BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time,
it won't be able to configure it correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, you will have to perform second
warm boot to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If you power down your system prior to booting
.Ox ,
the card should be configured correctly.
.It "xl%d: WARNING: no media options bits set in the media options register!"
This warning may appear when using the driver on some Dell Latitude
docking stations with built-in 3C905-TX adapters.
For whatever the reason, the
.Dq MII available
bit in the media options register on
this particular equipment is not set, even though it should be (the
3C905-TX always uses an external PHY transceiver).
The driver will
attempt to guess the proper media type based on the PCI device ID word.
The driver makes a lot of noise about this condition because
the author considers it a manufacturing defect.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ioprbs
.Nd I2O random block storage
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ioprbs* at iop? tid ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at ioprbs?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for I2O random block storages, like RAID-sets.
So far only the following adapters has been tested:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
.Tn Adaptec 2100S
.It
.Tn Adaptec 2110S
.It
.Tn Adaptec 3200S
.El
.Pp
Although only those two adapters have been tested, the I2O interface is
a generic one, and the driver should cope with all I2O random block
storages with no further adaptions.
.Pp
The storage is presented to the system as SCSI disks for uniformity
with other RAID controllers we support.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Niklas Hallqvist Aq niklas@@openbsd.org ,
inspired by the
.Nx
ld_iop driver by
.An Andrew Doran Aq ad@@netbsd.org .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

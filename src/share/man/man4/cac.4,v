.Sh NAME
.Nm cac
.Nd Compaq Smart ARRAY RAID controllers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cac* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at cac?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following RAID controllers:
.Tn Compaq Integrated Array ,
.Tn Compaq IAES ,
.Tn Compaq IDA ,
.Tn Compaq IDA-2 ,
.Tn Compaq RAID LC2 ,
.Tn Compaq Smart Array 221 ,
.Tn Compaq Smart Array 3100ES ,
.Tn Compaq Smart Array 3200 ,
.Tn Compaq Smart Array 4200 ,
.Tn Compaq Smart Array 4250ES ,
.Tn Compaq Smart Array 431 ,
.Tn Compaq SMART ,
.Tn Compaq SMART-2/E ,
.Tn Compaq SMART-2/P ,
.Tn Compaq SMART-2DH ,
.Tn Compaq SMART-2SL .
.Pp
All the RAID set volume management is done via the card BIOS.
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers the driver makes them
look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr sd 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq mickey@@openbsd.org ,
inspired by the
.Nx
driver by
.An Andrew Doran Aq ad@@netbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The card provides a mechanism to receive asynchronous notifications
about RAID set status change and so forth, unfortunately this
information is not public.
.Pp
Only a few PCI cards were tested, but others should work.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm com
and
.Nm pccom
drivers provide support for NS8250-, NS16450-, NS16550-, ST16650-, and
TI16750-based
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
The
.Nm pccom
driver (i386-only) also supports the XR16850 UART.
.Pp
The NS8250 and NS16450 have single
character buffers, the NS16550 has a 16 character buffer, while
the ST16650 has a 32 character buffer, and the TI16750 has a 64 character
buffer.
The XR16850 has a 128 character buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm com
and
.Nm pccom
drivers are mutually exclusive; both may not be present in the same system at
the same time.
Attempting to compile such a system will fail.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200, or any other baud rate which is a factor
of 115200.

The

driver was originally derived from the

.Nm dca
driver and is

.Sh BUGS
Data loss is possible on busy systems with unbuffered UARTs at high speed.

The name of this driver and the constants which define the locations
of the various serial ports are holdovers from

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.4
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

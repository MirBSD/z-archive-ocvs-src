.Sh NAME
.Nm random ,
.Nm srandom ,
.Nm urandom ,
.Nm prandom ,
.Nm arandom
.Nd random data source devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <dev/rndvar.h>
.Fd #include <dev/rndioctl.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The various
.Nm
devices produce random output data with different random qualities.
Entropy data is collected from system activity (like disk and
network device interrupts and such), and then run through various
hash or message digest functions to generate the output.
.Bl -hang -width /dev/srandomX
.It Pa /dev/random
This device is reserved for future support of hardware
random generators.
.It Pa /dev/srandom
Strong random data.
This device returns reliable random data.
If sufficient entropy is not currently available (i.e., the entropy
pool quality starts to run low), the driver pauses while more of
such data is collected.
The entropy pool data is converted into output data using MD5.
.It Pa /dev/urandom
Same as above, but does not guarantee the data to be strong.
The entropy pool data is converted into output data using MD5.
When the entropy pool quality runs low, the driver will continue
to output data.
.It Pa /dev/prandom
Simple pseudo-random generator.
.It Pa /dev/arandom
As required, entropy pool data re-seeds an ARC4 generator,
which then generates high-quality pseudo-random output data.
.Pp
The
.Xr arc4random 3
function in userland libraries seeds itself from this device,
providing a second level of ARC4 hashed data.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr arc4random_push 3
function, writes to the
.Dv KERN_ARND
.Xr sysctl 3
and writes to
.Pa /dev/prandom
feed data back into a buffer of int[16] into the kernel.
This can be disabled if you fear it reduces the entropy level by
setting the
.Dv KERN_PUSHRAND
.Xr sysctl 3 .

A

device first appeared in Linux operating system.
This is a cloned interface.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

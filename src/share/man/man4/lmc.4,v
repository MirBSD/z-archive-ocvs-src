.Sh NAME
.Nm lmc
.Nd Lan Media Corporation SSI/DS1/HSSI/DS3 card device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lmc* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "pseudo-device sppp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Lan Media Corporation SSI, DS1, HSSI, and DS3
PCI WAN adapters based on the DEC 21140 Ethernet chip.
The adapters use a DEC 21140 Ethernet chip for the PCI bus interface.
Leaving the bus interface chip, the data path goes through a field programmable
gate array, where HDLC processing is accomplished.
Leaving the FPGA, there are FIFO buffers and the DS1, DS3, and V.35 drive
circuitry.
.Pp
The intent is to provide a synchronous serial link with HDLC framing at speeds
of up to 10Mbps (for the SSI card), 52Mbps (for the HSSI card), BNC connectors
for 45Mbps operation without a CSU/DSU (DS3 card), and an RJ45 jack for
T1/E1 operation without a CSU/DSU (DS1 card).
.Pp
The card will automatically use HDLC framing and defaults to external clock
source.
For the DS1 and DS3 cards with built in CSU/DSU functionality,
the clock source is always external (from CSU/DSU).
The ability to set cable length is not currently implemented.
.Pp
Using the
.Xr sppp 4
driver, you can also use the ppp protocol.
In either case, the
.Nm
interface should be configured as a point-to-point
link.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "lmc%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lmc%d: couldn't establish interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lmc%d: enabling keepalive"
Cisco HDLC keepalive packets will be transmitted.
.It "lmc%d: disabling keepalive"
Cisco HDLC keepalive packets will not be transmitted.
.It "lmc%d: clock internal"
The card is using internal clocking for the line.
.It "lmc%d: clock external"
The card is using external clocking for the line.
.It "lmc%d: asserting DTR and RTS"
The card is sending DTR and RTS signals on the line.
.It "lmc%d: deasserting DTR and RTS"
The card is not sending DTR and RTS signals on the line.
.It "lmc%d: Abnormal interrupt"
The card received an incomplete request.
This may be a sign of a hardware fault.
.It "lmc%d: tx_intr: failed to dequeue mbuf?!?"
Only available if compiled with LMC_DEBUG.
.It "lmc%d: txput: tx not running"
Problem from tulip.
Only available if compiled with LMC_DEBUG.

Lan Media Corporation has a web site with data, descriptions, and pictures
of their cards at www.lanmedia.com.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
device driver was written by Michael Graff, and was derived in part from
Matt Thomas'
.Xr de 4
driver.
The
.Ox
port and manual page are from Chris Cappuccio.
Later enhancements to support the LMC1200 card are based on LMC's
Linux driver.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed
stable enough.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

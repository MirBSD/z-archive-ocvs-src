.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tga
.Nd TGA graphics driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tga* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tga?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver handles TGA graphics hardware within the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
On TGA adapters, the resolution is set on the card and is not changed
at runtime.
On some TGA models, there are four dip switches.
On other models, there is a rotary switch with positions 0-F.
There are also some that use jumpers.
.Ss TGA Switch Settings:
.Bl -column "Setting" "Pixel Freq" "Resolution" "Refresh Rate"
.It Li Switch Ta Pixel Ta Monitor Ta Refresh
.It Em "Setting	Freq (MHz)	Resolution	Rate (MHz)"
.It " "
.It Li 0 Ta 130 Ta 1280x1024 Ta 72
.It Li 1 Ta 119 Ta 1280x1024 Ta 66
.It Li 2 Ta 108 Ta 1280x1024 Ta 60
.It Li 3 Ta 104 Ta 1152x900 Ta 72
.It Li 4 Ta 93 Ta 1152x900 Ta 66
.It Li 5 Ta 75 Ta 1024x768 Ta 70
.It Li 6 Ta 74 Ta 1024x768 Ta 72
.It Li 7 Ta 69 Ta 1024x864 Ta 60
.It Li 8 Ta 65 Ta 1024x768 Ta 60
.It Li 9 Ta 50 Ta 800x600 Ta 72
.It Li A Ta 40 Ta 800x600 Ta 60
.It Li B Ta 32 Ta 640x480 Ta 72
.It Li C Ta 25 Ta 640x480 Ta 60
.El
.Pp
The settings for D, E, and F are for 1600x1200 on some cards, but
there are no guarantees.
.Pp
N.B.: The resolution selected is the resolution used in X windows.
.Pp
There are also a couple of extra jumpers on some cards.
One of these jumpers often selects the card to be the primary display.
Exactly one of the cards in your machine should have that jumper on.
If you have extra cards, they should have the jumper off.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4 ,
.Xr wsconscfg 8
.Sh BUGS
There are some problems with the background randomly switching between
black and blue.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed
stable enough.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

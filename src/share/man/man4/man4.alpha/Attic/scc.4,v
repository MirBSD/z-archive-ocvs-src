.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm scc
.Nd Zilog serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "scc0 at ioasic? offset ?"
.Cd "scc1 at ioasic? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Zilog 8530 Serial Communications
Controller (SCC) via the IOCTL asic on TURBOchannel-based alphas
(the DEC 3000 series).
Each scc device has two serial ports.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, or 57600.
Speeds up to 230400 are supported by the chip and the motherboard,
but speeds higher than 57600 do not work reliably without an external
clock signal.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/ttyB0
.It Pa /dev/ttyB1
.El
.Pp
The mapping from units to serial-hardware outlets is idiosyncratic.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The IOCTL asic provides internal DMA channels that can be programmed
to transfer up to 4096 bytes of data into, or out, of an SCC without
further software intervention.
This feature of the ioctl asic is not yet supported.
.Pp
The mapping from device-special files (major and minor number) to chip
and port is arguably backwards.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

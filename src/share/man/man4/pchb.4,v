.Sh NAME
.Nm pchb
.Nd PCI-Host Bridge
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pchb* at pci? dev ? function?"
.Cd "pci* at pchb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI-Host adapter-specific functions for
the following devices:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It i450 PCIset (Orion)
Supports additional PCI busses.
.It Reliance Computer ROSB4, CNB20HE, CNB20LE
Supports additional PCI busses.
.It i82424ZX (Saturn)
Disables CPU-PCI write posting.
.It i82443BX
Provides workaround for the following errata:
"An incorrect address may be driven on the
DRAM bus, resulting in memory data being
fetched from the wrong location."
.It i82810/810E, i82815/815E, i82820, i82840
Supports the random numbers generator,
supplying random bytes from the system's thermal noise.
Driven by periodic checks for available data from the generator,
it supplies entropy to the
.Xr random 4
driver for common usage.
.El
.Pp
On i386 systems all other PCI devices of class
.Nm Bridge
and sub-class
.Nm Bridge Host
are supported just as PCI attachment point.
.Pp
The macppc port supports several Apple and Motorola bridges.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4
.Sh HISTORY
Random number generator support first appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
Support for true RNG present on i82810 chips was added by
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq mickey@@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
Real RNG probe should fix the PCI scanning loop so it would find the Firmware
Hub (i82802) which actually contains the RNG device and
probe it as a real PCI device (i.e., common PCI registers are there).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

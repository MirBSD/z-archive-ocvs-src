.Dt ICMP6 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm icmp6
.Nd Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/in.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/icmp6.h>
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET6 SOCK_RAW proto
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn ICMPv6
is the error and control message protocol used
by
.Tn IPv6
and the Internet protocol family.
It may be accessed through a
.Dq raw socket
for network monitoring and diagnostic functions.
The
.Fa proto
parameter to the socket call to create an
.Tn ICMPv6
socket is obtained from
.Xr getprotobyname 3 ,
or you can use
.Dv IPPROTO_ICMPV6 .
.Tn ICMPv6
sockets are connectionless, and are normally used with the
.Xr sendto 2
and
.Xr recvfrom 2
calls, though the
.Xr connect 2
call may also be used to fix the destination for future packets
(in which case the
.Xr read 2
or
.Xr recv 2
and
.Xr write 2
or
.Xr send 2
system calls may be used).
.Pp
Outgoing packets automatically have an
.Tn IPv6
header prepended to them
.Pq based on the destination address .
The
.Tn ICMPv6
pseudo-header checksum field
.Pq Li icmp6_cksum
is filled automatically by the kernel.
Incoming packets are received without the
.Tn IPv6
header or IPv6 extension headers.
Notice that this behavior is opposite to that of
.Tn IPv4
raw sockets and
.Tn ICMPv4
sockets.
.Ss ICMPv6 type/code filter
Each
.Tn ICMPv6
raw socket has an associated filter whose datatype is defined as
.Li struct icmp6_filter ;
.Pp
This structure, along with the macros and constants defined later in
this section, are defined as a result of including the
.Aq Li netinet/icmp6.h
header.
.Pp
The current filter is fetched and stored using
.Xr getsockopt 2
and
.Xr setsockopt 2
with a level of
.Dv IPPROTO_ICMPV6
and an option name of
.Dv ICMP6_FILTER .
.Pp
Six macros operate on an icmp6_filter structure:
.\" is "Fn" legal for macros?
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It Ft void
.Fn ICMP6_FILTER_SETPASSALL "struct icmp6_filter *"
.It Ft void
.Fn ICMP6_FILTER_SETBLOCKALL "struct icmp6_filter *"
.It Ft void
.Fn ICMP6_FILTER_SETPASS "int" "struct icmp6_filter *"
.It Ft void
.Fn ICMP6_FILTER_SETBLOCK "int" "struct icmp6_filter *"
.It Ft int
.Fn ICMP6_FILTER_WILLPASS "int" "const struct icmp6_filter *"
.It Ft int
.Fn ICMP6_FILTER_WILLBLOCK "int" "const struct icmp6_filter *"
.El
.Pp
The first argument to the last four macros
.Pq an integer
is an
.Tn ICMPv6
message type, between 0 and 255.
The pointer argument to all six
macros is a pointer to a filter that is modified by the first four
macros examined by the last two macros.
.Pp
The first two macros,
.Dv SETPASSALL
and
.Dv SETBLOCKALL ,
specify that all
.Tn ICMPv6 messages are passed to the application or that all
.Tn ICMPv6
messages are blocked from being passed to the application.
.Pp
The next two macros,
.Dv SETPASS
and
.Dv SETBLOCK ,
specify that messages of a given
.Tn ICMPv6
type should be passed to the application
or not passed to the application
.Pq blocked .
.Pp
The final two macros,
.Dv WILLPASS
and
.Dv WILLBLOCK ,
return true or false
depending on whether the specified message type is passed to the
application or blocked from being passed to the application by the
filter pointed to by the second argument.
.Pp
When an
.Tn ICMPv6
raw socket is created, it will by default pass all
.Tn ICMPv6
message types to the application.
.Pp
For further discussions see RFC2292.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:
.Bl -tag -width [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
.It Bq Er EISCONN
when trying to establish a connection on a socket which
already has one, or when trying to send a datagram with the destination
address specified and the socket is already connected.
.It Bq Er ENOTCONN
when trying to send a datagram, but
no destination address is specified, and the socket hasn't been
connected.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
when the system runs out of memory for
an internal data structure.
.It Bq Er EADDRNOTAVAIL
when an attempt is made to create a
socket with a network address for which no network interface exists.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

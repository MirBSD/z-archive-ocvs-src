.Sh NAME
.Nm sf
.Nd Adaptec AIC-6915 "Starfire" PCI Fast Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sf* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Adaptec Duralink Fast Ethernet adapters
based on the Adaptec AIC-6915 "Starfire" chipset.
This includes the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
ANA-62011 64-bit single port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-62022 64-bit dual port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-62044 64-bit quad port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-69011 32-bit single port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-62020 64-bit single port 100baseFX
.El
.Pp
The AIC-6915 is a bus master controller with an MII interface.
It supports high and low priority transmit and receive queues, TCP/IP
checksum offload, multiple DMA descriptor formats and both polling
and producer/consumer DMA models.
The AIC-6915 receive filtering options include a 16 entry perfect
filter, a 512-bit hash table for multicast addresses, a 512-bit hash
table for priority address matching and VLAN filtering.
An external MII-compliant transceiver is required for media interfacing.
.Pp
Multiport adapters consist of several AIC-6915 controllers connected
via a PCI to PCI bridge.
Each controller is treated as a separate interface by the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sf%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
This may happen if the PCI BIOS did not configure the device, which can occur
when the BIOS has been configured for a "Plug and Play" operating system.
The "Plug and Play OS" setting in the BIOS should be set to "no" or
"off" in order for PCI devices to work properly with
.Ox .
.It "sf%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
This may happen if the PCI BIOS did not configure the device, which can occur
when the BIOS has been configured for a "Plug and Play" operating system.
The "Plug and Play OS" setting in the BIOS should be set to "no" or
"off" in order for PCI devices to work properly with
.Ox .
.It "sf%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sf%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "sf%d: failed to enable I/O ports/memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI I/O port or shared memory access.
This might happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "sf%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

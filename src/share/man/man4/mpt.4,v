.Sh NAME
.Nm mpt
.Nd LSI Fusion-MPT SCSI and FibreChannel host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mpt* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at mpt?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support
for the LSI Logic Fusion-MPT family of
.Tn SCSI
and
.Tn Fibre Channel
controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
53c1020
.Pq Single Ultra320 Tn SCSI

.Pq Dual Ultra320 Tn SCSI

.Pq Dual 1Gb/s Tn Fibre Channel
.It

.Pq 2Gb/s Tn Fibre Channel
.It

.Pq Dual 2Gb/s Tn Fibre Channel
.It
Emulated in VMWare ESX Server 2
.El
.Pp
The LSI Logic SCSI and Fibre Channel controllers contain firmware that presents
a multiprotocol service layer based on the LSI Logic Fusion-MPT architecture.
The firmware isolates the host drivers from the hardware and controls the
device side of the message passing interface to the host device drivers.
The firmware manages all phases of an I/O request and optimizes the interrupt
management for the system.
For Fibre Channel, the firmware also manages all FC-2 through FC-4 services,
which minimizes the amount of Fibre Channel unique services required with the
host driver.
.Pp
The MPI (Message Passing Interface) defintion includes a register-level
transport mechanism and a messaging protocol.
A system doorbell and message queues define the MPI transport interface.
Inbound Message Frames (MF), allocated in host memory, indentify I/O operations
to be performed by the IO Controller (IOC).
These operations are queued on the Request Queue by the host driver.
Outbound Message Frames, also in host memory, track I/O operations as they
complete.
These frames are queued on the Reply Queue by the IOC.
A doorbell mechanism is provided for IOC configuration, reset management,
and IOC status.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Om
driver was ported from
.Nx
by Milos Urbanek, Kenneth R. Westerback and Marco Peereboom.
.Sh BUGS
This driver does not function properly with MPT firmware levels higher than
1.03.00.
.Pp
The runtime MPT firmware is displayed under the REV heading for the 1020/1030
chips during POST.
Example:
.Bd -literal
HBA ID LUN VENDOR   PRODUCT               REV SYNC  WIDE
--- -- --- -------- ---------------- -------- ----- ----
 0   7  0  LSILogic 1020/1030[  102]  1013D00 320.0  16
 1   7  0  LSILogic 1020/1030[  102]  1013D00 320.0  16
.Ed
.Pp
The version is 1013D00 which translates to 1.01.3D.00.
The last two digits are normally not used and it is written in decimal notation.
Thus making this example version 1.01.61.

1.1.1.1
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd WaveLAN/IEEE, PRISM 2-3 and Spectrum24 802.11DS wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# i386/macppc/sparc64"
.Cd "wi* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "wi* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Pp
.Cd "# macppc"
.Cd "wi* at macobio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM-2, Intersil PRISM-2.5, Intersil PRISM-3
and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets.
All five chipsets provide a similar interface to the driver.
.Pp
All host/device interaction is via programmed I/O.
Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS,
IBSS, WDS and ad-hoc operation modes.
Cards based on the Intersil chips also support a host-based access point
mode which allows a card to act as a normal access point (with some
assistance from the
.Nm
driver).
The Lucent Hermes and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets do not contain this
functionality.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps fixed, 2Mbps fixed, 2Mbps
with auto fallback, 5.5Mbps, 8Mbps, or 11Mbps depending on your hardware.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Silver and Gold cards as well as the Intersil
and Symbol cards have support for WEP encryption.
The WaveLAN Gold as well as newer Intersil and Symbol cards support
104bit keys, the others only accept 40bit keys.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Bronze cards do not support WEP at all.
To enable encryption, use the
.Xr wicontrol 8
utility to set your keys, or use
.Xr ifconfig 8
as shown below.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the card for BSS operation (aka infrastructure
mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point (base station).
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports an ad-hoc (point-to-point) mode where
the nwid is ignored and stations can communicate amongst
themselves without the aid of an access point.
Note that there are two possible ad-hoc modes.
One mode, referred to as
.Dq ad-hoc demo mode ,
predates the IEEE 802.11 specification and so may not interoperate
with cards from other vendors.
The standardized ad-hoc mode, also known as IBSS mode, is not
supported by cards with very old firmware revisions.
.Pp
Cards based on the Intersil chipsets also have a host-based access point
mode which allows the card to act as an access point (base station).
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver come in a variety of packages, though the most common
are of the PCMCIA type.
In many cases, the PCI version of a wireless card is simply
a PCMCIA card bundled with a PCI adapter.
The PCI adapters come in two flavors: true PCMCIA bridges and
dumb PCMCIA bridges.
A true PCMCIA bridge (such as those sold by Lucent) will attach
as a real PCMCIA controller.
The wireless card will then attach to the PCMCIA bus.
Wireless cards in PCMCIA slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.
.br
A dumb bridge, on the other hand, does not show up as a true PCMCIA bus.
The wireless card will simply appear to the host as a normal PCI
device and will not require any PCMCIA support.
Cards in this type of adapter should only be removed when the
machine is powered down.
.Pp
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:

Note that some of the PRISM-II adapters only work at 3.3V, hence
.Xr cardbus 4
support is required for those cards to set VCC correctly, even
though they are really 16bit cards.

or 9052 chip.

The

.Sh CAVEATS
The original Lucent WaveLAN cards usually default to channel 3;
newer cards use channel 10 by default.
Non-Lucent cards vary, for instance the Addtron cards use channel
11 by default.
See
.Xr wicontrol 8
for information on how to change the channel.
.Pp
Not all 3.3V
.Nm
PCMCIA cards work.
.Pp
IBSS creation does not currently work with Symbol cards.
.Pp
The host-based access point mode on the Intersil PRISM cards has
bugs when used with firmware versions prior to 0.8.3 and is completely
unusable with firmware versions 0.7.5 and 1.4.0-1.4.2.

.Pp
Software WEP is currently only supported in HostAP and BSS modes.
Furthermore, Software WEP is currently incapable of decrypting
fragmented frames.
Lucent-based cards using firmware 8.10 and above fragment encrypted
frames sent at 11Mbps.
To work around this, Lucent clients with this firmware revision
connecting to a HostAP server should use a 2Mbps connection or
upgrade their firmware to version 8.72.
.Pp
HostAP mode doesn't support WDS or power saving.
Clients attempting to use power saving mode may experience
significant packet loss
(disabling power saving on the client will fix this).
.Pp
Support for USB devices is buggy.

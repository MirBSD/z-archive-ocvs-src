.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <net/if.h>
.Fd #include <net/if_media.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides a consistent method for querying and setting
network interface media and media options.
The media is typically set using the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.

.Pp
The following sections describe the possible media settings for each
link type.
Not all of these are supported by every device; refer to
your device's manual page for more information.
.Pp
The lists below provide the possible names of each media type or option.
The first name in the list is the canonical name of the media type or
option.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Bsx 3.0 .
The implementation that appeared in
.Nx 1.3
was written by Jonathan Stone and Jason R. Thorpe to be compatible with
the BSDI API.
It has since gone through several revisions which have extended the
API while maintaining backwards compatibility with the original API.
.Pp
Support for the
.Sy IEEE802.11 Wireless LAN
link type was added in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Pp
.Sy Host AP
mode was added in
.Ox 3.1 .

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm hme
.Nd Sun Happy Meal Ethernet
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hme* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "hme* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Cd "qsphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn National
DP83840
Ethernet 10/100 Mb/s Physical Layer
or the
.Tn Quality
QS6612
Ethernet MII Transceiver for Category 5 Twisted Pair Cable
chip sets.
The
.Nm
is found on the SunSwift and Sun QuadFastEthernet boards.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are:
100Mb/s Full Duplex, 100Mb/s Half Duplex, 10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and
10 Mb/s Half Duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 100baseTX  mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseTX, full duplex
.It media 100baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100baseTX, half duplex
.It media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Use 10baseT, full duplex
.It media 10baseT Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 10baseT, half duplex

.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for the
.Nm
first appeared in
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
sbus cards will not function in a sun4c class machine,
due to PROM limitations.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

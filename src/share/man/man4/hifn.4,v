.Sh NAME
.Nm hifn
.Nd Hifn 7751/7951/7811 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hifn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports various cards containing the Hifn 7751, Hifn 7951, Hifn 7811,
or Hifn 9751 chipsets, such as
.Bl -tag -width namenamenamena -offset indent
.It Invertex AEON
No longer being made.
Came as 128KB SRAM model, or 2MB DRAM model.
.It Hifn 7751
Reference board with 512KB SRAM.
.It PowerCrypt
See
.Pa http://www.powercrypt.com/ .
Comes with 512KB SRAM.
.It XL-Crypt
See
.Pa http://www.powercrypt.com/ .
Only board based on 7811 (which is faster than 7751 and has
a random number generator).
.It NetSec 7751
See
.Pa http://www.netsec.net/ .
Supports the most IPsec sessions, with 1MB SRAM.
.It Soekris Engineering vpn1201 and vpn1211
See
.Pa http://www.soekris.com/ .
Contains a 7951 and supports symmetric and random number operations.
.It Hifn 9751
Reference board with 512KB SRAM.
This is really a Hifn 7751 which only supports compression.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate DES, Triple-DES, ARC4, MD5,
MD5-HMAC, SHA1, SHA1-HMAC, and LZS operations for
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr crypto 4 ,
except for the Hifn 9751 which only registers to support LZS.
.Pp
The
.Tn Hifn 7951
and
.Tn Hifn 7811
will also supply data to the kernel
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Sh BUGS
The 7751 chip starts out at initialization by only supporting compression.
A proprietary algorithm, which has been reverse engineered, is required to
unlock the cryptographic functionality of the chip.
It is possible for vendors to make boards which have a lock ID not known
to the driver, but all vendors currently just use the obvious ID which is
13 bytes of 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

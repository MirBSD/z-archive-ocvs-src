.Sh NAME
.Nm rtfps
.Nd multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rtfps0 at isa? port 0x1230 irq 10"
.Cd "com* at rtfps? slave ?"
or
.Cd "pccom* at rtfps? slave ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for IBM RT PC boards that multiplex together up to four
.Rn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
or
.Tn RS-422A
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to four
.Nm com
devices.
The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in
.Sx SYNOPSIS .
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/tty0?
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr com 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Charles Hannum, based on the
.Nm ast
driver.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver is unlikely to work on non-PCI machines.
The ISA bus only asserts 10 I/O address lines, and this is not enough.
.Pp
Even on PCI machines, some address conflicts have been observed.
On one machine, the second port always conflicted with something (though
it's not clear what) and caused strange results.
Disabling the second port in the kernel config allowed the other three
ports to function correctly.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

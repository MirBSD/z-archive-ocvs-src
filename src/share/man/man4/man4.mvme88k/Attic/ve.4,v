.Sh NAME
.Nm ve
.Nd MVME376 Ethernet I/O adapter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ve0 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1200 ipl 1 len 0x100"
.Cd "ve1 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1400 ipl 1 len 0x100"
.Cd "ve2 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1600 ipl 1 len 0x100"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the AMD 7990/LANCE-based MVME376 VME board.
This in turn provides an interface to the
.Tn Ethernet
network.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Pp
Depending on the version of the board, the type of the Ethernet connector
varies. In most cases either an BNC or AUI connector is provided.
.Pp
By default, the system will select the media type automatically, but the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command can be used to force the media selection.
The media types are shown below:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 10base5
Use the AUI connector
.It media 10base2
Use the BNC connector

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

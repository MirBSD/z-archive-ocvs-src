.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides access to the
.Tn MVME328
.Tn SCSI
.Tn VME
I/O board.
Depending on the version it provides a single or dual channel
.Tn SCSI
interface.
It is attached to the
.Tn VME
bus of the system, controlled by the
.Xr vme 4
.Tn VMEchip2
interface chip.
Several types of both internal and external connectors are provided, also
depending on the version of the
.Tn MVME328 .

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through a set of nine jumpers, labeled
.Dq JB1
on the board, near the fuse in a corner of the card.
They are contiguous to the
.Dq JA7
single jumper and
.Dq JA8
dual jumper, located immediately to the left of the
.Dq JB1
block.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff"
.It Li JB1 Ta Address Ta Configuration
.It " "
.It Li "___X_XX__" Ta "0xffff9000" Ta "1st board"

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

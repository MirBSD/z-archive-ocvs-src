.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd Intel i82596CA LAN coprocessor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ie0 at pcctwo0 offset 0x46000 ipl 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the
.Tn Intel
i82596CA 32-bit
Local Area Network Coprocessor for
.Tn Ethernet .
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Pp
The i82596CA chip is integrated on both the
.Tn MVME187
and
.Tn MVME197
Single-Board Computers.
The available external connector depends on the P2 converter board.
In most cases either a BNC or AUI connector is provided.
.Pp
By default, the system will select the media type automatically, but the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command can be used to force the media selection.
The media types are shown below:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 10base5
Use the AUI connector
.It media 10base2
Use the BNC connector

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ess
.Nd ESS Technology AudioDrive family audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" .Cd "ess0   at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1 drq2 5"
.Cd "ess*   at isapnp?"
.\" .Cd "ess*   at ofisa?"
.Cd "audio* at ess?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the ESS 1788, 1888, 1887, and 888 AudioDrive
audio devices.
.Pp
The AudioDrive 1788 is a half-duplex device, while the 1888, 1887, and
888 are full-duplex.
All are capable of 8- and 16-bit audio sample recording and playback
at rates up to 44.1kHz.
.Pp
The AudioDrive takes 16 I/O ports.
The I/O port range, IRQ, and DRQ channels are set by the driver
to the vaues specified in the configuration file (or for isapnp or ofisa,
the values assigned from the firmware).
The I/O port base must be one of 0x220, 0x230, 0x240,
0x250.
The IRQ must be one of 5, 7, 9, 10 (or 15 on the 1887 only).
The first DRQ channel must be selected from 0, 1, 3.
The second DRQ channel (used for playback by the full-duplex 1888/1887, ignored
by the 1788) can additionally be set to 5.
If both DRQ channels are used they must be different.
.Pp
The joystick interface (if enabled) is handled by the
.Xr joy 4
driver.
.Sh BUGS
The AudioDrive devices have a SoundBlaster compatibility mode, and may
be detected by the SoundBlaster driver (see
.Xr sb 4 )
rather than the AudioDrive driver.
The workaround is to remove or disable the SoundBlaster driver from the kernel
configuration.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.2
log
@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd memory files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The special file
.Pa /dev/mem
is an interface to the physical memory of the computer.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing
memory itself.
Only offsets within the bounds of
.Pa /dev/mem
are allowed.
.Pp
Kernel virtual memory is accessed through the interface
.Pa /dev/kmem
in the same manner as
.Pa /dev/mem .
Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped to memory are allowed.
.Pp
On amd64, physical memory is discontiguous; especially,
the ISA I/O memory space covers the physical address range from
.Li 0x000a0000
to
.Li 0x00100000 .
.Pp
The kernel virtual memory begins at address
.Li 0xffffffff80000000.
.Pp
Writeability of these devices is controlled by the system
.Xr securelevel 7 .

1.1.1.1
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

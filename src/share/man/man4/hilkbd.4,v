.Sh NAME
.Nm hilkbd
.Nd HIL keyboard driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hilkbd* at hil? code ?"
.Cd "wskbd* at hilkbd? console ?"
.Cd "option HILKBD_LAYOUT=XXX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports HIL keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
It doesn't provide direct device driver entry points, but makes its
functions available through the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings.
By default, the layout corresponding to the keyboard model as probed
by the
.Nm
driver will be used.
A different layout can be chosen either with the kernel option
.Dq HILKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time, or with the
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility (variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding
) at runtime.
.Pp
The supported key mappings are at this time:
.Bl -hang
.It KB_FR
(
.Dq fr
) French with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_SV
(
.Dq sv
) Swedish.
.It KB_UK
(
.Dq uk
) British.
.It KB_US
(
.Dq us
) English / US keyboard mapping.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a swedish keyboard mapping, use
.Ic wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=sv .
To set it at kernel build time, regardless of what keyboard is plugged, add
.Em option HILKBD_LAYOUT="KB_SV"
to the kernel configuration file.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hil 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh BUGS
The list of built-in mappings doesn't follow any logic.
It grew as people submitted what they needed.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

The list of built-in mappings is incomplete and has grown as people submitted
information about their particular layout.
.Pp
The Swedish and British layout have been reconstructed from tables in the old
HIL code present in the hp300 port, and have not been tested.

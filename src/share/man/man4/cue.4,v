.Sh NAME
.Nm cue
.Nd CATC USB-EL1201A USB Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cue* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Computer
Access Technology Corporation's USB-EL1202A chipset.
This includes the following adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Tn CATC Netmate
.It Tn CATC Netmate II
.It Tn Belkin F5U111
.El
.Pp
The USB-EL1202A supports a 512-bit multicast hash filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The CATC adapter supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there are no
.Xr ifmedia 4
modes to select.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "cue%d: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "cue%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq wpaul@@ee.columbia.edu
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Aaron Campbell Aq aaron@@openbsd.org .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

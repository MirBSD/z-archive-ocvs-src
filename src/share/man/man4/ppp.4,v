.Nd point to point protocol network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pseudo-device ppp
.Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows serial lines to be used as network interfaces using the
.Em Point-to-Point Protocol
(PPP).
The
.Nm
interface can use various types of compression and has many features
over the SLIP protocol used by the
.Xr sl 4
interface.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It ppp%d: af%d not supported .
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

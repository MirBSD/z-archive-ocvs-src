.Dt UBSEC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ubsec
.Nd Broadcom and BlueSteel uBsec 5x0x crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ubsec* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards containing any of the following chips:
.Bl -tag -width "Broadcom BCM5821" -offset indent
.It Bluesteel 5501
The original chipset, no longer made.
This extremely rare unit
was not very fast, lacked a RNG, and had a number of other bugs.
.It Bluesteel 5601
A faster and fixed version of the original, with a random number
unit and large number engine added.
.It Broadcom BCM5801
A BCM5805 without public key engine or random number generator.
.It Broadcom BCM5802
A slower version of the BCM5805.
.It Broadcom BCM5805
Faster version of Bluesteel 5601.
.It Broadcom BCM5820
64 bit version of the chip, and significantly more advanced.
.It Broadcom BCM5821
Faster version of the BCM5820.
.It Broadcom BCM5822
Faster version of the BCM5820.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate DES, Triple-DES, MD5-HMAC,
and SHA1-HMAC operations for
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr crypto 4 .
.Pp
On those models which contain a public key engine (almost all of the
more recent ones), this feature is registered with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem.
.Pp
On all models except the Bluesteel 5501 and Broadcom 5801, the driver
registers itself to provide random data to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh BUGS
The BCM5801 and BCM5802 have not actually been tested.
The Sun Crypto Accelerator 1000 is suspected to be a Broadcom 5821.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

Also, some of the newer chips support AES but it is not supported by the driver.

.Sh NAME
.Nm de
.Nd DEC DC21x4x (Tulip) Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "de* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Ethernet adapters based on the Digital
Equipment DC21x4x based self-contained Ethernet chips.
This includes, among others, the following models:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Asante
.It Cogent EM100FX and EM440TX
.It DEC PCI DE435, EISA DE425, DE450, DE500
.It older LinkSys 10, 10/100
.It SMC 8432, 9332, 9334
.It ZNYX ZX3xx
.El
.Pp
This driver may support other cards based on the 21040 and 21041 Ethernet
controllers, or the 21140[A], 21141, 21142, and 21143 Fast Ethernet
controllers.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
.It Cm media No 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation on the 10baseT port.
.It Cm media No 10base2
Set 10Mbps operation on the BNC port.
.It Cm media No 10base5
Set 10Mbps operation on the AUI port.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.It Cm media No 100baseFX
Set 100Mbps operation.
.It Cm media No 100baseT4
Set 100Mbps operation (4-pair cat-3 cable).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent -compact
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation for UTP port.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by your card try
.Ic ifconfig -m <device> .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig -m de0 .
.Pp
Note that the media types available depend on the particular card in use.
Some cards are explicitly programmed to a particular media type by a
setup utility and are not changeable.
.Pp
Use the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command and in particular the
.Fl m
flag to list the supported media types for your particular card.
.Pp
The old
.Dq ifconfig linkN
method of configuration is not supported.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "de%d: waking device from sleep/snooze mode"
The 21041 and 21140A chips support suspending the operation of the card.
.It "de%d: error: desired IRQ of %d does not match device's actual IRQ of %d"
The device probe detected that the board is configured for a different
interrupt than the one specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "de%d: not configured; limit of %d reached or exceeded"
There is a limit of 32
.Nm
devices allowed in a single machine.
.It "de%d: not configured; 21040 pass 2.0 required (%d.%d found)"
.It "de%d: not configured; 21140 pass 1.1 required (%d.%d found)"
Certain revisions of the chipset are not supported by this driver.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
Since the 21040 is available on both EISA and PCI boards, one must be careful
in how one defines the 21040 in the kernel config file.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Pp
On the alpha platform, disk space requirements on the installation media
cause the
.Nm
driver to be preferred to the
.Nm dc
driver.
However, the
.Nm dc
will perform better on some hardware; if this is the case, it is advised to
rename the
.Pa /etc/hostname.de*
files to
.Pa /etc/hostname.dc* ,
and disable the
.Nm
driver in the kernel, so that the
.Nm dc
driver will be used.
Refer to
.Xr boot_config 8
for details on how to disable drivers in the kernel.

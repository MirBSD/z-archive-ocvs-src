.Sh NAME
.Nm lge
.Nd "Level 1 LXT1001 NetCellerator PCI gigabit ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lge* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various NICs based on the Level 1 LXT1001
NetCellerator gigabit ethernet controller chip, including the
following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
SMC TigerCard 1000 (SMC9462SX)
.It
D-Link DGE-500SX
.El
.Pp
These NICs are capable of 1000mbps speeds over fiber optic cable.
The LXT1001 also supports a GMII port for use with 10/100/1000 copper
PHYs, however there aren't currently any NICs on the market that use
this feature.
.Pp
The LXT1001 supports TCP/IP checksum offload for receive and
VLAN-based filtering as well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter.
It also supports jumbo frames, which can be configured
via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.
Using jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 1000baseSX
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000baseSX operation over fiber optic cable.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "lge%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lge%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lge%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lge%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "lge%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might
happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "lge%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "lge%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

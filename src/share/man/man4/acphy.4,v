.Sh NAME
.Nm acphy
.Nd "Driver for Altima AC101, AC101L and AMD Am79c874 10/100 Ethernet PHYs"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Altima AC101, AC101L and AMD Am79c874 NetPHY-1LP
10/100 Ethernet PHYs.  These PHYs are often found on low-power
Ethernet interfaces, such as MiniPCI interfaces found in
laptops and embedded systems.
.Pp
The AMD 79c874 is a work-alike (most likely an OEM of the core) of the
Altima part.

@Import OpenBSD source tree from CVS (anoncvs canada)
of roughly 12:00 UTC today. Bumps us to OpenBSD 3.4
and makes source/ports in sync. Hopefully.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

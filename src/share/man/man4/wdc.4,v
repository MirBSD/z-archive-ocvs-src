.Nd WD100x compatible hard disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# alpha/i386"
.Cd "wdc0 at isa? port 0x1f0 irq 14 flags 0x00"
.Cd "wdc1 at isa? port 0x170 irq 15 flags 0x00"

.Pp
.Cd "atapiscsi* at wdc?* channel ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "wd* at wdc? drive ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the basic functions for the
.Xr wd 4
and
.Xr atapiscsi 4
drivers.
It supports IDE and EIDE controllers, as well as MFM, RLL, and ESDI on
the ISA bus.
PCI IDE controllers in legacy mode are also supported, but the
.Xr pciide 4
driver may provide more functionality.
.Pp
For the ISA front-end, setting
.Cm flags
to 0x01 enables 32-bit I/O negotiation.
This is known to cause problems with some motherboards.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

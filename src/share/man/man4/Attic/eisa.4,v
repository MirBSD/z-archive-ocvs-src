.Sh NAME
.Nm eisa
.Nd Introduction to EISA bus machine-independent drivers and support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
Machine-dependent; depends on the bus topology and
.Tn EISA
bus interface of your system.
Typical
.Tn EISA
buses are either connected directly
to the main system bus, or via an
.Tn PCI
to
.Tn EISA
bridge.
See the
.Xr intro 4
documentation for your system for details.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Ox
includes a machine-independent
.Tn EISA
bus subsystem and several machine-independent
.Tn EISA
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn EISA
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn EISA
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Ox
includes machine-independent
.Tn EISA
drivers, sorted by device type
and driver name:
.Ss Disk and tape controllers
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It Xr cac 4
Compaq array controllers.
.It Xr dpt 4
DPT SmartCache/SmartRAID controllers.
.El
.Ss SCSI interfaces
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It Xr ahb 4

.It Xr ahc 4

.Tn SCSI

.It Xr bha 4

.It Xr uha 4

.El
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It Xr ep 4
3Com 3c579 and 3c592 10Mbit
.Tn Ethernet ,
and 3c597 10/100Mbit
.Tn Ethernet
interfaces.
.It Xr fea 4

.\" .It Xr le 4
.\" Digital DE422
.\" .Tn Ethernet
.\" interfaces.
.\" .It Xr tlp 4
.\" Digital DE425
.\" .Tn Ethernet
.\" interfaces.
.El
.Pp[B
Note that most or all
.Tn EISA
devices also have
.Tn PCI
or
.Tn ISA
equivalents.
These are listed in
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
or
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
respectively.
The manual pages for each individual driver also lists the
supported bus variants.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ami
.Nd American Megatrends Inc. MegaRAID Controllers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ami* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at ami?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for MegaRAID family of RAID controllers.
.Pp
These controllers support RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, JBOD
and superpositions of those configurations.
.Pp
Some cards support both I2O and so called `Mass Storage' mode
of operation.
This driver only supports the `Mass Storage' mode, I2O mode is supported
by the
.Xr iop 4
driver.
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers the driver makes them
look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.

versions of these controllers were not tested.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uhid
.Nd USB generic HID support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uhid* at uhidev? reportid ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for all HID (Human Interface Device) interfaces
in USB devices that do not have a special driver.
.Pp
The device handles the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv USB_GET_REPORT_ID (int)
Get the report identifier used by this HID report.
.It Dv USB_GET_REPORT_DESC (struct usb_ctl_report_desc)
Get the HID report descriptor.
Using this descriptor the exact layout and meaning of data to/from
the device can be found.
The report descriptor is delivered without any processing.
.Bd -literal
struct usb_ctl_report_desc {
    int     size;
    u_char  data[1024];	/* filled data size will vary */
};
.Ed
.It Dv USB_SET_IMMED (int)
Sets the device in a mode where each
.Xr read 2
will return the current value of the input report.
Normally a
.Xr read 2
will only return the data that the device reports on its
interrupt pipe.
This call may fail if the device does not support this feature.
.It Dv USB_GET_REPORT (struct usb_ctl_report)
Get a report from the device without waiting for data on
the interrupt pipe.
The
.Fa report
field indicates which report is requested.
It should be
.Dv UHID_INPUT_REPORT ,
.Dv UHID_OUTPUT_REPORT ,
or
.Dv UHID_FEATURE_REPORT .
This call may fail if the device does not support this feature.
.Bd -literal
struct usb_ctl_report {
	int report;
	u_char	data[1024];	/* used data size will vary */
};
.It Dv USB_SET_REPORT (struct usb_ctl_report)
Set a report in the device.
The
.Dv report
field indicates which report is to be set.
It should be
.Dv UHID_INPUT_REPORT ,
.Dv UHID_OUTPUT_REPORT ,
or
.Dv UHID_FEATURE_REPORT .
This call may fail if the device does not support this feature.
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Use
.Xr read 2
to get data from the device.
Data should be read in chunks of the size prescribed by the report descriptor.
.Pp
Use
.Xr write 2
send data to the device.
Data should be written in chunks of the size prescribed by the report
descriptor.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr usbhidctl 1 ,
.Xr usbhid 3 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Ox 2.6 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

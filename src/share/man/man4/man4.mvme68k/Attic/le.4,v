.Nd Ethernet driver for AMD7990(LANCE)-based boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at pcc0 offset 0x1800 ipl 1" Pq "onboard interface"
.Cd "le* at vmes0 addr 0xffff1200 ipl 1 vec 0x74 len 0x100" Pq "MVME376"

.Cd "le* at vmes0 addr 0xffff1600 ipl 1 vec 0x76 len 0x100" Pq "MVME376"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following mvme68k hardware:
.Bl -tag -width "onboard" -offset indent
.It Em onboard
MVME147 onboard ethernet interface
.It Em MVME376
MVME376 VMEbus ethernet card
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The mvme68k
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Ox 2.0

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

is defined through three sets of DIP switches,

located in the middle of the board, near the space between the two
VME connectors, and
.Dq SW3 ,
closer to the AM7990DC chip at the bottom edge.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm wskbd
.Nd generic keyboard support in wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd wskbd* at pckbd? console ? mux 1
(PS/2 keyboard)
.Cd wskbd* at ukbd? console ? mux 1
(USB keyboard)
.Cd wskbd* at akbd? console ? mux 1
(Apple ADB keyboard)
.Cd wskbd* at comkbd? console ? mux 1
.Cd wskbd* at zskbd? console ? mux 1
(Sun serial keyboard)
.Cd wskbd* at hilkbd? console ? mux 1
(HIL keyboard)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles common tasks for keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
It is attached to the hardware specific keyboard drivers and
provides their connection to
.Dq wsdisplay
devices and a character device interface.
.Pp
The common keyboard support consists of:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Mapping from keycodes (defined by the specific keyboard driver) to
keysyms (hardware independent, defined in
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsksymdef.h ) .
.It
Handling of
.Dq compose
sequences.
Characters commonly not present as separate key on keyboards
can be generated after either a special
.Dq compose
key is pressed or a
.Dq dead accent
character is used.
.It
Certain translations, like turning an
.Dq ALT
modifier into an
.Dq ESC
prefix.
.It
Automatic key repetition
.Pf ( Dq typematic ) .
.It
Parameter handling for
.Dq keyboard bells .
.It
Generation of
.Dq keyboard events
for use by X servers.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a number of ioctl functions to control key maps
and other parameters.
These functions are accessible though the associated
.Dq wsdisplay
device as well.
A complete list is in
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h .
The
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility allows to access key maps and other variables.
.Pp
The
.Em console
locator in the configuration line refers to the device's use as input
part of the operating system console.
A device specification containing a positive value here will only match
if the device is in use as system console.
(The console device selection in early system startup is not influenced.)
This way, the console device can be connected to a known
.Xr wskbd 4
device instance.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver traps certain key sequences intended to perform special functions.
The
.Cm Ctrl+Alt+Esc
sequence will initiate the
.Xr ddb 4
kernel debugger if the
.Dq ddb.console
.Xr sysctl 8
variable is set.
When attached to a
.Xr wsdisplay 4
device,
.Cm Ctrl+Alt+Fx
switches virtual terminals and the
.Cm Shift+PgUp
and
.Cm Shift+PgDn
combinations provide scrollback functionality if the underlying hardware
driver supports it.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.5
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

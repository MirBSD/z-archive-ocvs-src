.Dt PNINEK 4 sparc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pninek
.Nd Weitek Power9000 accelerated frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "btcham0 at obio?"
.Cd "pninek0 at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at pninek?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a color frame buffer with graphics acceleration, embedded in the
.Tn "Tadpole SPARCbook"
3 laptop.
It is based on the
.Tn "Weitek Power9000"
video processor and a
.Tn Brooktree
Bt445
.Sq Chameleon
RAMDAC.
.Pp
Due to specifics of the video hardware on the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3, the complete driver is split in two parts:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Nm btcham
RAMDAC interface
.It Nm pninek
Video controller interface
.El
.Pp
The combination of both
.Nm btcham
and
.Nm
drivers interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
They do not provide direct device driver entry points
but make their function available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
If the
.Xr tctrl 4
device is also configured, the
.Nm
will be powered down when the lid of the laptop
is closed or the screen is blanked.

.Sh BUGS
There is currently no way to switch back and forth from
the onboard display to the external connector.
It is not possible to change resolutions.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm tvtwo
.Nd accelerated 24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tvtwo* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tvtwo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a memory based color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration
and overlay capabilities, and hardware MPEG decoding.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr agten 4 ,
.Xr bwtwo 4 ,
.Xr cgeight 4 ,
.Xr cgfour 4 ,

.Xr vigra 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4 ,
.Xr zx 4 ,
.Xr boot_config 8 ,
.Xr config 8
.Sh CAVEATS
This driver does not support any acceleration features at the moment.
Thus, vertical scrolling in console mode is abysmally slow in 24 bit mode.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SBus (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus? slot ? offset ?                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Cd "stty* at spif?                                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?                                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm spif
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931)
based around the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the
Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:

      |   |   |   |   |   +---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---------------> unused

      |   |   |
      |   |   +-----------------------> unused
      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif%d: ccr timeout"
A timeout occurred while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty%d-%d: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm spif
driver was first supported in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by
.An Jason Wright Aq jason@@thought.net ,
and is heavily based on the
.Xr magma 4
driver written by
.An Iain Hibbert Aq plunky@@skate.demon.co.uk .
.Sh TODO
The parallel port is not supported yet.
.Pp
Dial-out (cua) devices are not yet supported.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

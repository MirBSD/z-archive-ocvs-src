.Dd June 22, 2003
.Dt TSLOT 4 sparc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tslot
.Nd Tadpole PCMCIA Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tslot0 at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "pcmcia* at tslot? socket ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver manages the
.Xr pcmcia 4
controller part of the
.Xr tctrl 4
.Tn Tadpole
TS102 controller found on the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3 series laptops.
It provides two PCMCIA slots and can receive up to two PCMCIA type 1
or type 2 cards, or one PCMCIA type 3 card.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pcmcia 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr tctrl 4
.Sh CAVEATS
Due to hardware limitations, it is not possible to run a 3.3V card and a 5V
card at the same time.
.Sh BUGS
Unlike other PCMCIA adapters which are little-endian, this bridge
provides a big-endian
.Xr pcmcia 4
bus.
Therefore, 16 bit drivers need to be made aware of this before they will
work.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

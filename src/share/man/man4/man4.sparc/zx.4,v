.Sh NAME
.Nm zx
.Nd accelerated 24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zx* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at zx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The ZX and TurboZX
are dual-slot SBus color frame buffers, with graphics acceleration
and overlay capabilities.
They are also known as the
.Tn Sun
.Dq Leo
graphics card.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh DISPLAY RESOLUTION
The following resolutions are supported by the ZX frame buffer:
.Bl -column "Resolution" "Refresh Rate"
.It Li Resolution Ta "Refresh Rate"
.Pp
.It Li 1280x1024 Ta 76 Hz Ta Non-interlaced
.It Li 1280x1024 Ta 67 Hz Ta Non-interlaced
.It Li 1152x900 Ta 76 Hz Ta Non-interlaced
.It Li 1152x900 Ta 66 Hz Ta Non-interlaced
.It Li 1024x768 Ta 76 Hz Ta Non-interlaced
.It Li 1024x768 Ta 60 Hz Ta Non-interlaced
.\" Is it worth documenting the Stereo and TV modes?
.It Li 960x680 Ta 112 Hz Ta "Stereo, non-interlaced"
.It Li \  Ta \  Ta "56 Hz field rate per eye"
.It Li 960x680 Ta 108 Hz Ta "Stereo, non-interlaced"
.It Li \  Ta \  Ta "54 Hz field rate per eye"
.It Li 770x575 Ta 50 Hz Ta "Interlaced - PAL"
.It Li 640x480 Ta 59.94 Hz Ta "Interlaced - NTSC"
.El
.Pp
If the ZX frame buffer is connected to a monitor at boot time, it will
select its display resolution depending of the monitor
.Sq select code
provided by the 13W3 connector.
If the frame buffer is not connected to a monitor, the default resolution
of 1152x900, with a 66 Hz refresh rate, will be selected.
The selected resolutions are:
.Bl -column "sense code" "Resolution" "Refresh" "Monitor"
.It Li Monitor Ta Resolution Ta Refresh Ta Monitor
.It Li "sense code" Ta \  Ta Rate Ta Type
.Pp
.It Li 0 Ta 1024x768  Ta "76 Hz" Ta X449A
.It Li 1 Ta 1152x900  Ta "66 Hz"
.It Li 2 Ta 1280x1024 Ta "76 Hz" Ta X248A, GDM-205S
.It Li 3 Ta 1152x900  Ta "66 Hz" Ta GDM-1955A15, GDM-1604A15, CPD-1790
.It Li 4 Ta 1280x1024 Ta "67 Hz" Ta GDM-20D10, GDM-1962
.It Li 5 Ta 1152x900  Ta "66 Hz"
.It Li 6 Ta 1152x900  Ta "76 Hz" Ta GDM-1662B, 17SMM4
.It Li 7 Ta 1152x900  Ta "66 Hz"

.Sh CAVEATS
The ZX and TurboZX cards will not function in a sun4c class machine or
in an SBus expansion box, due to PROM limitations.
.Pp
There is currently no software interface to change the frame buffer
resolution at runtime.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

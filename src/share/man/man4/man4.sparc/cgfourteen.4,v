.Sh NAME
.Nm cgfourteen
.Nd accelerated 8/24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgfourteen0 at obio0 addr 0x9c000000" Pq "SS10SX and SS20"
.Cd "cgfourteen1 at obio0 addr 0x90000000" Pq "SS10SX and SS20"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at cgfourteen?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is the on-board color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration and
overlay capabilities, found on the
SPARCstation 10SX and SPARCstation 20 workstations.
The frame buffer will not be enabled unless a VSIMM memory module is
installed.
.Pp
The second frame buffer will also require an
.Sq Auxiliary Video Board
to be installed.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh DISPLAY RESOLUTION
If the
.Nm
frame buffer is used as the console display, a different resolution than the
default 1152x900 can be selected by changing the OpenPROM environment.
To change the default resolution, type the following:
.Pp
.Em \   ok
setenv
.Em output-device
screen:r1280x1024x76
.Pp
to change to a 76Hz 1280x1024 resolution.
.Pp
If the
.Nm
frame buffer is a secondary display, or a serial console is used, the
display resolution can not be changed without using an
.Em nvramrc
OpenPROM script.
Refer to the
.Em Sun Frame Buffer FAQ
for details.
.Pp
The
.Nm
frame buffer accepts the following resolutions:
.Ss Supported Video Modes
.Bl -tag -width screen:r1280x1024x76m -compact
.It screen:r1152x900x66
Standard 1152x900, with a refresh rate of 66Hz.
.It screen:r1152x900x76
Standard 1152x900, with a refresh rate of 76Hz.
This is the default setting.
.It screen:r1280x1024x66
High res 1280x1024, with a refresh rate of 66Hz.
.El
.Ss Unsupported Video Modes
The following video modes are supported by the hardware, but not by
.Tn Sun .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width screen:r1280x1024x76m -compact
.It screen:r1024x768x60
Super VGA 1024x768, with a refresh rate of 60Hz.
.It screen:r1024x768x66
Super VGA 1024x768, with a refresh rate of 60Hz.
.It screen:r1024x768x70
Super VGA 1024x768, with a refresh rate of 70Hz.
.It screen:r1024x800x84
1024x800, with refresh rate of 84Hz.
.It screen:r1280x1024x76m
High res 1280x1024, with a refresh rate of 76Hz.
There is no typo, the
.Sq m
suffix is required.
.It screen:r1600x1280x66
High res 1600x1280, with a refresh rate of 66Hz.
.It screen:r1920x1080x72
1920x1080, with a refresh rate of 72Hz.
.El
.Pp
Resolutions of 1280x1024, 1600x1280 and 1920x1080 are 8-bit only
with 4MB VSIMM.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

By default, the frame buffer will be initialized in 32 bit mode, if the
display resolution allows it.
By setting
.Ar flags
to
.Ar 0x0001
(via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 )
it can be forced to 8 bit mode, resulting in a faster console.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

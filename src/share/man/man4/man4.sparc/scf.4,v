.Sh NAME
.Nm scf
.Nd SPARC Force sysconfig driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "scf0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the system configuration registers on
the Force CPU-5.
The system configuration registers control the LED display on
the front panel, the status of the rotary switch, and the flash
programming control registers.
.Pp
By setting the
.Xr sysctl 8
value
.Ar machdep.led_blink
to a non-zero value, the two user LEDs will blink back and forth
at a rate of 1 second per point of load average.
The seven segment LED will also show a numeric value for the load
average (in hex), and with load averages higher than 15, the decimal
point will be lit.
.Sh IOCTLS
The
.Nm
device responds to the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls defined in
.Aq Pa machine/scfio.h :
.Bl -tag -width
.It Dv SCFIOCSLED1
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Set LED1 register based on the bits below.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#define SCF_LED_COLOR_MASK      0x03    /* color bits */
#define SCF_LED_COLOR_OFF       0x00    /* led off */
#define SCF_LED_COLOR_GREEN     0x01    /* green led */
#define SCF_LED_COLOR_RED       0x02    /* red led */
#define SCF_LED_COLOR_YELLOW    0x03    /* yellow led */
#define SCF_LED_BLINK_MASK      0x0c    /* blink bits */
#define SCF_LED_BLINK_NONE      0x00    /* steady led */
#define SCF_LED_BLINK_HALF      0x04    /* blink 1/2 hz */
#define SCF_LED_BLINK_ONE       0x08    /* blink 1 hz */
#define SCF_LED_BLINK_TWO       0x0c    /* blink 2 hz */
.Ed
.It Dv SCFIOCGLED1
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Retrieve the value of the LED1 register (bits defined above).
.It Dv SCFIOCSLED2
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Set the value of the LED2 register (bits defined above).
.It Dv SCFIOCGLED2
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Retrieve the value of the LED2 register (bits defined above).
.It Dv SCFIOCSLED7
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Set the value of the 7-segment LED based on the bits below:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#define SCF_7LED_A              0x01    /* Layout:      */
#define SCF_7LED_B              0x02    /*      AAA     */
#define SCF_7LED_C              0x04    /*     FF BB    */
#define SCF_7LED_D              0x08    /*      GGG     */
#define SCF_7LED_E              0x10    /*     EE CC    */
#define SCF_7LED_F              0x20    /*      DDD  P  */
#define SCF_7LED_G              0x40
#define SCF_7LED_P              0x80
.Ed
.It Dv SCFIOCGROT
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Retrieve the value of the 16 position rotary switch on the front panel.
.It Dv SCFIOSFMCTRL
.Pq Li "u_int8_t"
Set up the flash memory for writing based on the bits below:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#define SCF_FMCTRL_SELROM       0x01    /* sel 1st/2nd device */
#define SCF_FMCTRL_SELBOOT      0x02    /* sel boot/user flash */
#define SCF_FMCTRL_WRITEV       0x04    /* write voltage */
#define SCF_FMCTRL_SELADDR      0x38    /* addr 21:19 bits */
.Ed
.Pp
The SCF_FMCTRL_SELROM
bit, if clear, selects the first flash device, otherwise the second
flash device is selected.
The
.Ar SCF_FMCTRL_SELBOOT
bit, if set, selects the user flash, otherwise the boot flash is selected.
Setting the
.Ar SCF_FMCTRL_WRITEV
bit turns on the write voltage.
The
.Ar SCF_FMCTRL_SELADDR
bits determine which window of 512 KBytes is active for reading/writing.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

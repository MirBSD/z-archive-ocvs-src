.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is an on-board or SBus SCSI controller based on the NCR 53c94 chip, found
on Sun 4/300, sun4c and sun4m workstations.
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width "Bits XX-XX" -compact
.It Bits 0-7
Disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It Bits 8-15
Disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.
Targets 4 through 7 typically have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
that tape devices normally have one of these targets.
Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus to operate
acceptably.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

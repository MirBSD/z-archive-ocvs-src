.Sh NAME
.Nm daadio
.Nd MATRIX MD-DAADIO digital/analog, analog/digital, parallel i/o board
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "daadio* at fvme? addr 0x0 level 1 vect 0x1f"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm daadio
driver provides
.Xr ioctl 2
entry points to read and write analog/digital, digital/analog, and
parallel input/output registers.
A typical
.Nm
has 6 8bit parallel ports, 8 12bit DAC ports, and 32 12bit ADC ports.
.Pp
The
.Nm
has a large number of configuration options, but the driver does not.
For the ADC, only simple polled mode is supported (there is no
support for single cycle sampling).
.Sh IOCTLS
The
.Nm
device responds to the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls defined in
.Aq Pa machine/daadioio.h :
.Bl -tag -width DIOGOPIO
.It Dv DIOGPIO
.Pq Li "struct daadio_pio"
Get the value of the parallel port
.Ar dap_reg
and store it in
.Ar dap_val .
The argument structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct daadio_pio {
        u_int8_t dap_reg;
        u_int8_t dap_val;
};
.Ed
.It Dv DIOSPIO
.Pq Li "struct daadio_pio"
Set the value of the parallel port
.Ar dap_reg
to the value in
.Ar dap_val .
.It Dv DIOSDAC
.Pq Li "struct daadio_dac"
Set the value of the DAC port in
.Ar dac_reg
to the value in
.Ar dac_val .
The argument structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct daadio_dac {
        u_int8_t dac_reg;
        u_int16_t dac_val;
};
.Ed
.It Dv DIOGADC
.Pq Li "struct daadio_adc"
Get the value of the ADC port specified in
.Ar dad_reg
into
.Ar dad_val .
The lower 12 bits of
.Ar dad_val
are the conversion value, the upper four bits are used for status.
The argument structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct daadio_adc {
        u_int8_t dad_reg;
        u_int16_t dad_val;
#define ADC_IV 0x1000 /* out of range */
#define ADC_PR 0x2000 /* pipeline empty */
#define ADC_DR 0x4000 /* data ready */
#define ADC_OW 0x8000 /* data overwritten */
#define ADC_VAL 0x0fff /* the data */
};

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm mgx
.Nd SMS MGX and MGXPlus accelerated 24-bit color frame buffers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mgx* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at mgx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Southland Media Systems
.Pq now Tn "Quantum 3D"
MGX and MGXPlus are SBus color frame buffers, with graphics acceleration
capabilities.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.

drives the card in PROM-compatible, 8 bit, mode only.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

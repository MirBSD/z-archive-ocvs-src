.Sh NAME
.Nm be
.Nd SPARC Fast Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "qec* at sbus? slot ? offset ?                 " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Cd "be* at qec?                                   " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s (half duplex only)
Ethernet networks.
The
.Nm
is found on the Sun 10/100 Mbit Ethernet boards
(Sun part number SUNW,501-2450).
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
The
.Nm
is not capable of link autonegotiation, so a media type must be specified
with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxx -offset indent
.It media 100baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100Mbps, half duplex
.It media 10baseT Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 10Mbps, half duplex

.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for the
.Nm
first appeared in
.Ox 2.4 .

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

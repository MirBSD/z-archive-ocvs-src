.Sh NAME
.Nm auich
.Nd Intel 82801AA/AB/BA/CA, 82440MX, and compatibles PCI audio driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "auich* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at auich?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AC97-based audio present on the Intel
82801AA/AB/BA/CA I/O controller hub (ICH/ICH0/ICH2/ICH3), 82440MX chipset,
SiS 7012, AMD 768, AMD 8111, NVIDIA nForce and nForce2 chips.
The
.Nm
DMA engine supports full-duplex operation and has separate channels
for line input and microphone.
Unfortunately, simultaneous recording from both line and microphone inputs
is not supported due to the current
.Xr ac97 4
design.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some hardware implementations only support 48kHz sampling rates.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.5
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Sh NAME
.Nm an
.Nd Aironet Communications 4500/4800 IEEE 802.11DS wireless network adapter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "an* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "an* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Aironet Communications 4500, 4800
(aka Cisco 340), and Cisco 350
IEEE 802.11 Direct Sequence wireless network adapters.
This includes the ISA, PCI, and PCMCIA varieties.
The 4500 series adapters operate at 1 and 2Mbps while
the 4800 and 350 series can operate at 1, 2, 5.5, and 11Mbps.
The ISA, PCI,
and PCMCIA devices are all based on the same core PCMCIA modules
and all have the same programming interface.
However, unlike the
Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE cards, the ISA and PCI cards appear to the
host as normal ISA and PCI devices and do not require any pcmcia
support.
.Pp
ISA cards can either be configured to use ISA Plug and Play
or to use a particular I/O address and IRQ
by properly setting the DIP switches on the board.
(The default switch setting is for plug and play.)
The
.Nm
driver has Plug and Play support and will work in either configuration,
however when using a hard-wired I/O address and IRQ, the driver
configuration and the NIC's switch settings must agree.
PCI cards
require no switch settings of any kind and will be automatically
probed and attached.
.Pp
All host/device interaction with the Aironet cards is via programmed I/O.
The Aironet devices support 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management,
BSS (infrastructure), and IBSS (ad-hoc) operation modes.
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however,
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is
selectable between 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps, 11Mbps or
"auto" (the NIC automatically chooses the best speed).
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the Aironet card for BSS operation with an SSID
of "".
In this mode,
stations can communicate among each other without the aid of an access
point.
To join a service set, the driver must be set for BSS mode using
the
.Xr ancontrol 8
utility.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "an%d: init failed"
The Aironet card failed to come ready after an initialization command was
issued.
.It "an%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
.It "an%d: device timeout"
The Aironet card failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.

support was added in

driver was written by

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various FM radio cards.
It provides an uniform programming interface layer above different underlying
radio hardware drivers.
.Pp
For radio tuner controlling there is a single device file available:
.Pa /dev/radio .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RIOCSSRCH (int)
This command assumes that a signal search is required and gives direction
of search to the driver - 0 to search down and any non-zero value to search up.
.It Dv RIOCSINFO (struct radio_info)
.It Dv RIOCGINFO (struct radio_info)
Get or set the current hardware device information into the struct radio_info
structure.
.Bd -literal

	int	mute;
	int	volume;
	int	stereo;
	int	rfreq;	/* reference frequency */
	int	lock;	/* locking field strength */

};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va mute
field is a boolean.
.Pp
The
.Va volume
field holds the card volume information and can be at most 255.
.Pp
The
.Va stereo
field is a boolean.
.Pp
The
.Va rfreq
holds information about the card reference frequency (not all cards support
this feature).
.Pp
The
.Va lock
field holds information about the card locking field strength during
an automatic search for cards that support this feature.
.Pp
The
.Va freq
field is the frequency in kHz the card is tuned to.
.Pp
The
.Va caps
field is read-only and describes the card capabilities.
The capabilities can have following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_STEREO
The device can determine is it tuned to a stereo signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_SIGNAL
The device can determine is it tuned or not.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_SET_MONO
The device capable to forcible set its output to mono.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_SEARCH
The device can do hardware search.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_AFC
The device has an internal hardware automatic frequency control.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_REFERENCE_FREQ
The device allow to change the reference frequency of a received signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_LOCK_SENSITIVITY
The device allow to change the station lock sensitivity used during search
operation.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_CARD_TYPE
Some cards have several different incarnations.
This allow to determine the variant of the card.
Currently not used.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va info
field is read-only and describes current state of the card - tuned/not tuned,
stereo signal/mono signal.
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_SIGNAL
Informs whether the device receives a valid signal or noise.
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_STEREO
Informs whether the device receives a stereo or mono signal.

.Sh CHIPSETS
LM700x is a frequency synthesizer IC.
The LM700x is programmed through a 24-bit write-only shift register.
The first 14 bits are frequency data.
The next 2 bits are LSI test bits, and should always be zero.
The next 4 bits are band data and time base data.
They can be programmed to force a given reference frequency, or they can be
set to zero and the next 3 bits can be used to set the reference frequency.
The final bit selects the divider selection, which is 1 for FM and 0 for AM.
The LM700x chips are used in
.Xr az 4
and
.Xr rt 4
cards.
.Pp
The TEA5757; TEA5759 is a 44-pin integrated AM/FM stereo radio circuit.
The radio part is based on the TEA5712.
The TEA5757 is used in FM-standards in which the local oscillator frequency
is above the radio frequency (e.g. European and American standards).
The TEA5759 is the version in which the oscillator frequency is below
the radio frequency (e.g. Japanese standards).
To conform with the Japanese standards it is needed to set the flags least
significant bit to 1.
The TEA5757; TEA5759 has a 25-bit read-write shift register.
The TEA5757 chips are used in
.Xr gtp 4 ,
.Xr rtii 4 ,
.Xr sf2r 4
and
.Xr fms 4
cards.
.Pp
The TC9216P, TC9217P and TC9217F are high speed PLL-LSI with built-in
2 modulus prescaler.
Each function is controlled through 3 serial bus lines (DATA, CLOCK and PERIOD)
by the data setting to a pair of 24-bit registers, total of 48 bits.
Address 8 bits and data 24 bits, total of 32 bits, are transferred in serial
at the same time.
The TC921x chips are used in
.Xr sfr 4
cards.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

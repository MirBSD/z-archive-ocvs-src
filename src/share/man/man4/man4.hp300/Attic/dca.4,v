serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dca0 at dio? scode 9 flags 1" Pq "on-board serial interfaces"
.Cd "dca* at dio? scode ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn 98644A
is a single port
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface with a single character buffer.
Such an interface is built-in to all series 300 machines.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to one of the following baud rates:
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400.
.Pp
An optional argument
.Ar flags
may be set to 1 if the line should be treated as hard-wired
with carrier always present or 0 if modem control is desired.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/tty[0-3]
.It Pa /dev/cua[0-3]
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It dca%d: silo overflow.
The single-character input
.Dq silo
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apci 4 ,
.Xr dcm 4 ,
.Xr dio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh BUGS
Data loss is possible on busy systems with baud rates greater than 300.
The
.Nm
has never been tested with modem control enabled or on anything but the
built-in interface.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

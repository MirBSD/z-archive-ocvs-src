.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gbox
.Nd
.Tn HP98700
.Dq Gatorbox
frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gbox* at intio?"
.Cd "gbox* at dio? scode ?"
.Cd "grf*  at gbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn HP98700
and
.Tn HP98710
are 4-bit color frame buffers,
also known as the Gatorbox.
They can be extended to 8-bit color with an
.Tn HP98701
frame buffer extension.
The 98710 also has some acceleration features.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr grf 4
driver, and the associated
.Xr ite 4
console framework.
.Pp
The 98700 can be used as the only graphics device on a system, in which case
it will be used as the system console.
It can also be installed as a secondary display device.
For the first case, the
.Tn HP98287A M.A.D.
interface card
should be set to internal control space.
This will put the frame buffer at the DIO address 0x200000 and the control
registers at 0x560000.
At this address it will be the ``preferred'' console device (see
.Xr cons 4 ) .
For use as a secondary device,
the 98287A should be set to frame buffer address 0x300000,
and to an external select code.
.Pp
It should be noted that this configuration will conflict with the 98547
display card which has a 2 megabyte frame buffer starting at address 0x200000.
The 98700 should only be installed as a secondary device in a machine with a
1 bit 98544 display card or 4 bit 98545 card.
The
.%T 98700H Installation Guide
contains further configuration information.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

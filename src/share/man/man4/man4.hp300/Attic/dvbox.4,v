.Dq DaVinci
frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dvbox* at intio?"
.Cd "dvbox* at dio? scode ?"
.Cd "grf*   at dvbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn HP98730
and
.Tn HP98731 
are stackable 4-bit color frame buffers,
also known as the DaVinci.
By adding up to 7
.Tn HP98732A
frame buffer extensions, it is possible to add overlay planes.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr grf 4
driver, and the associated
.Xr ite 4
console framework.
.Pp
The DaVinci can be configured at either the ``internal'' address
(frame buffer address 0x200000, control register space address 0x560000)
or at an external select code less than 32.
At the internal address it will be the ``preferred'' console device
(see
.Xr cons 4 ) .
The hardware installation manual describes the procedure for
setting these values.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr gbox 4 ,
.Xr grf 4 ,
.Xr hyper 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr rbox 4 ,
.Xr topcat 4
.Sh BUGS
This driver has not been tested with all possible combinations of frame
buffer boards and scan boards installed in the device.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

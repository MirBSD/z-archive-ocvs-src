.Sh NAME
.Nm dcm
.Nd
.Tn HP 98642A
serial communications multiplexer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dcm* at dio? scode ? flags 0xe"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn 98642A
is a four port
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications
multiplexer.
The
.Tn 98642A
has three direct-connect ports and one port with
full modem control.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to one of the following baud rates:
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
9600, 19200, 38400.
.Pp
.Ar Flags
is usually specified as 0xe since 3 of the 4 ports (1-3) do not support
modem control and should be treated as hard-wired with carrier always present.
If port 0 does not have the need for modem control then flags can be specified
as
.Ql 0xf .
.Pp
Each port on the
.Tn 98642A
has a 128 byte input silo and a 16 byte output silo.
Interrupts happen on a per character basis unless the interrupt
rate for the card reaches 70 interrupts per second at which time the
driver changes to a 16.7ms (60 interrupts per second) polling scheme until
the interrupt rate drops.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/tty0[0-9a-f] -compact
.It Pa /dev/tty0[0-9a-f]
.It Pa /dev/cua0[0-9a-f]
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It dcm%d port%d: silo overflow
Input Silo has overflowed and incoming data
has been lost.
.Pp
.It dcm%d port%d: uart overflow
The 3 character buffer in the uart has
overflowed.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apci 4 ,
.Xr dio 4 ,

.Sh BUGS
Total throughput per card, all ports together, is limited to 76800 bits per
second continuous input rate.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

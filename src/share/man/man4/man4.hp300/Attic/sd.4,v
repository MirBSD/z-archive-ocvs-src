.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sd
.Nd SCSI disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sd* at oscsi? target ? lun ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for a
.Tn SCSI
disk.
It allows the disk to be divided up into a set of pseudo devices called
.Em partitions .
.Pp
When the
.Tn SCSI
adapter is probed during boot, the
.Tn SCSI
bus is scanned for devices.
Any devices found which answer as
.Sq Em Direct
type devices will be attached to the
.Nm
driver.
The devices will be attached as
.Li sdN
devices, matching their
.Tn SCSI
identifiers.
For example, a disk with
.Tn SCSI
id set to 6 will attach as
.Li sd6 .
.Sh PARTITIONING
.Xr disklabel 8
is used to partition the drive into filesystems.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply to
.Tn SCSI
disks as well as to other disks.
They are defined in the header file
.Aq Pa sys/disklabel.h .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width DIOCSDINFO
.\".It Dv DIOCSBAD
.\"Usually used to set up a bad-block mapping system on the disk.
.\".Tn SCSI
.\"drive incorporate their own bad-block mapping so this command is not
.\"implemented.
.It Dv DIOCGDINFO
Read, from the kernel, the in-core copy of the disklabel for the
drive.
This may be a fictitious disklabel if the drive has never
been initialized, in which case it will contain information read
from the
.Tn SCSI
inquiry commands.
.It Dv DIOCSDINFO
Give the driver a new disklabel to use.
The driver
.Em will not
write the new
disklabel to the disk.
.It Dv DIOCWLABEL
Enable or disable the driver's software
write protect of the disklabel on the disk.
.It Dv DIOCWDINFO
Give the driver a new disklabel to use.
The driver
.Em will
write the new disklabel to the disk.
.It Dv DIOCLOCK
Lock the media cartridge into the device, or unlock a cartridge previously
locked.
Used to prevent user and software eject while the media is in use.
.It Dv DIOCEJECT
Eject the media cartridge from a removable device.
.El
.Pp
In addition, the
.Tn SCSI
general
.Fn ioctl
commands may be used with the
.Nm
driver, but only against the
.Sq Li c
(whole disk) partition.
.Sh NOTES
If a removable device is attached to the
.Nm
driver, then the act of changing the media will invalidate the
disklabel and information held within the kernel.
To avoid corruption, all access to the device will be discarded until there
are no more open file descriptors referencing the device.
During this period, all new open attempts will be rejected.
When no more open file descriptors reference the device, the next 
open will load a new set of parameters (including disklabel) for the drive.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.Nm ,
found in the
.Pa /dev
directory, is used to create various special files.
See
.Xr intro 4
for a more complete discussion of special files.
.Pp
.Nm
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device or group of devices.
.Pp
Where a device name is followed by a star
.Sq * ,
the star must be replaced by a unit number.
If units are expected for a device but not provided,
.Nm
will supply the standard numbers in most cases.
.Pp
The sparc supports the following devices:

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

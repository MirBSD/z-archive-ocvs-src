.Dt BOOT_ALPHA 8 alpha
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd Alpha system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Cold starts
When powered on, the SRM firmware will proceed to its initialization, and
will boot an operating system if the
.Ev Em auto_action
variable is set to
.Dq boot
or
.Dq restart ,
or will wait for interactive commands if set to
.Dq halt .
.Ss Warm starts
After a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the SRM console will only restart the system if the
.Ev Em auto_action
variable is set to
.Dq boot .
.Ss Boot process options
The SRM console will attempt to boot a kernel named from the
.Ev Em boot_file
environment variable, on the device listed in the
.Ev Em bootdef_dev
variable.
A list of the recognized SRM devices can be obtained with the command
.Ic show dev
at the SRM prompt.
If the
.Ev Em boot_file
variable is not set or empty,
.Pa /bsd
will be used by default.
.Pp
The kernel will be passed the options listed in the
.Ev Em boot_osflags
variable.
Option letters are case insensitive.
The following option letters are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX" -offset indent -compact
.Pp
.It Cm a
Boot the system multi-user.
.It Cm b
Enter the debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
as soon as the kernel console has been initialized.
.It Cm c
Enter the
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode upon startup
.Pq Xr boot_config 8 .
.It Cm d
Create a kernel crash dump immediately after the devices have been configured.
This option is only available on kernels compiled with
.Qq option DEBUG .
.It Cm h
On the next system reboot, always halt the system, even if a reboot is
required.
.It Cm n
Prompt for the root filesystem device after the devices have been configured.
.It Cm s
Boot the system single-user.
This is the default behaviour of the kernel if no flags are specified.
.El
.Ss Abnormal system termination
In case of system crashes, the kernel will usually enter the kernel
debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
unless it is not present in the kernel, or it is disabled via the
.Em ddb.panic
sysctl.
Upon leaving ddb, or if ddb was not entered, the kernel will halt the system
if it was still in device configuration phase, or attempt a dump to the
configured dump device, if possible.
The crash dump will then be recovered by
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle.
It is also possible to force other behaviours from ddb.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/netboot -compact
.It Pa /bsd
default system kernel
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx
primary bootstrap for
.Dq ffs
file system
.It Pa /usr/mdec/boot
secondary bootstrap (usually also installed as
.Pa /boot )
.It Pa /usr/mdec/netboot
network bootstrap

The device names used by

.Ns Tn /alpha
and the
.Tn SRM Console
often have no relation to each other.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

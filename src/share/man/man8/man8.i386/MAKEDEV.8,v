.Sh NAME
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Nd create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Ar name
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.Nm ,
found in the
.Pa /dev
directory, is used to create various special files.
See
.Xr intro 4
for a more complete discussion of special files.
.Pp
.Nm
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device or group of devices.
.Pp
Where a device name is followed by a star
.Sq * ,
the star must be replaced by a unit number.
If units are expected for a device but not provided,
.Nm
will supply the standard numbers in most cases.
.Pp
The i386 supports the following devices:

@* regenerate generated files (MAKEDEV, syscalls)
* regenerate i386->FLOPPY and sparc->GENERIC manually
* remove sun4 support from sparc kernel, because our CFLAGS
  prevent v7 from working anyways
* patch in Claudio Jeker's tap-for-tun diff, and fix his
  spelling and whitespace-at-eol (he delivers good KNF tho)
* move cccp.1 manpage to where gcc-local.1 landed as well
  (the FSF COPYING is a bit more restrictive, but easy enough;
  we have worse things in usr.sbin/?????/)
* bcopy, bcmp, bzero removal
* memcpy -> memmove where memcpy() is not available
* overhaul of headers (bcopy, too)
* a bunch more NULL and time_t fixes

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.3
log
@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

1.1.1.5
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Dt BOOT_MAC68K 8 mac68k
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd
.Tn mac68k-specific
system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the
.Ox
kernel on the mac68k architecture is booted from the native operating
system by means of an application program.
When the kernel takes over,
it initializes itself and proceeds to boot the system.
An automatic
consistency check of the file systems takes place, and unless this
fails, the system comes up to multi-user operations.
The proper way to shut the system down is with the
.Xr shutdown 8
command.
.Pp
If the system crashes, it will enter the kernel debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
if it is configured in the kernel.
If the debugger is not present
or has exited, the system will attempt a dump to the
configured dump device (which will be automatically recovered with
.Xr savecore 8
during the next boot cycle).
After the dump completes (successful
or not), the system will attempt a reboot.
.Pp
On most mac68k machines with
.Dq soft-power
after the IIcx, the power
switch can be physically rotated and locked in the
.Dq on
position.
The native OS can be configured to automatically start the
.Ox
boot program.
Additionally, the
.Ox
boot program can be configured to boot
.Ox
without intervention.
When a system is so configured, it can crash
or lose power and reboot back to a fully multi-user state without
any intervention.
.Ss The boot application
The boot application runs in the native OS on the system.
It has a
dialog where booting preferences may be changed and an option whereby
these options may be saved.
The preferences are stored in the program
itself, not in a preferences folder, thus allowing two separate copies
of the program to be configured differently (e.g., to boot different
bsd or bsd.test, or to boot from two different drives).
.Pp
One option that may be specified is a boot to single-user mode.
This stops the boot process very early on and allows system maintenance.
If one wishes to provide some security at this phase of the boot, remove
the
.Dq secure
option from ttye0 in the
.Xr ttys 5
file.
.Pp
Another useful option that may be specified is the
.Dq serial console
option.
This will allow a serial device (terminal or computer) to
act as a console for the system.
This device must be configured to
use 9600 baud, eight bits, no parity, and one stop bit (9600-8N1).
Either the printer port or the modem port (tty01 and tty00,
respectively) may be used for this.
.Pp
It is sometimes useful to boot a kernel that resides in a folder
in native OS rather than from the usual location in the
.Ox
file system.
A radio button is supplied for this purpose.
Note that some programs will not run properly if the kernel is not found as
.Pa /bsd
within the
.Ox
file system.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

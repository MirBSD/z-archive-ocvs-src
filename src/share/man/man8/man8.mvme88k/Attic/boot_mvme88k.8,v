.Dt BOOT_MVME88K 8 mvme88k
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_mvme88k
.Nd mvme88k system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Cold starts
When powered on, the mvme88k
.Tn BUG
firmware will proceed to its initialization, and
will boot an operating system if autoboot is enabled.
By sending a
.Dq break
to the serial line during the initialization sequence,
it is possible to stop the boot process and interact with the
.Tn BUG .
.Ss Warm starts
After a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the
.Tn BUG
firmware will only restart the operating system if autoboot is enabled
and
.Dq Auto Boot at power-up only
is disabled in the
.Tn BUG
environment.
.Ss Boot process options
The
.Tn BUG
firmware will let the user enter a boot device identification, kernel filename
and boot options.
If no filename is specified,
.Pa /bsd
will be used by default.
.Pp
The following boot options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width "-XXX" -offset indent -compact
.Pp
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root filesystem device after the devices have been configured.
.It Fl b
On the next system reboot, always halt the system, even if a reboot is
required.
.It Fl c
Enter the
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode upon startup
.Pq see Xr boot_config 8 .
.It Fl d
Enter the debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
as soon as the kernel console has been initialized.
.It Fl s
Boot the system single-user.
The system will be booted multi-user unless this option is specified.
.El
.Ss Abnormal system termination
In case of system crashes, the kernel will usually enter the kernel
debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
unless it is not present in the kernel, or it is disabled via the
.Em ddb.panic
sysctl.
Upon leaving ddb, or if ddb was not entered, the kernel will halt the system
if it was still in device configuration phase, or attempt a dump to the
configured dump device, if possible.
The crash dump will then be recovered by
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle.
It is also possible to force other behaviours from ddb.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/installboot -compact
.It Pa /bsd
default system kernel
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx
primary bootstrap code for
.Dq ffs
file system on SCSI disks
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootsd
secondary bootstrap code for SCSI disks (usually also installed as
.Pa /bootsd )
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootst
SCSI tape bootstrap code
.It Pa /usr/mdec/netboot
network bootstrap code
.It Pa /usr/mdec/sboot
network bootstrap code in S-Records, for older
.Tn BUG
firmware lacking the
.Li NBO
command.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/rboot
network bootstrap code in S-Records, suitable for user eeprom burning.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/stboot
.Tn Motorola
VID block put as first file on bootable SCSI tapes

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

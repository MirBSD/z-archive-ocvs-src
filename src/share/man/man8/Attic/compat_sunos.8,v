.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_sunos
.Nd setup for running SunOS binaries under emulation
.Sh DESCRIPTION
OpenBSD/sparc and some of the OpenBSD/m68k architectures can run
SunOS executables.
Most executables will work.
.Pp
The SunOS compatibility feature is active
for kernels compiled with the
.Nm COMPAT_SUNOS
option enabled.
.Pp
Compatibility with SunOS version 5 and later, better known as Solaris,
is
.Em not
addressed by these instructions; please read the
.Xr compat_svr4 8
manual page instead.
.Pp
The exceptions include programs that use the SunOS kvm library,
and various system calls, ioctl()'s, or kernel semantics
that are difficult to emulate.
The number of reasons why a program might fail to work is (thankfully)
longer than the number of programs that fail to run.
.Pp
Static executables will normally run without any extra setup.
This procedure details the directories and files that must be
set up to allow dynamically linked executables to work.
.Pp
The files needed can be found on the SunOS machine.
The user is responsible for the legal issues of ensuring that they
have a right to use the required files on their machine.
On the
.Ox
machine, do the following:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -inset -offset 123 -compact
.It
.Li mkdir -p /emul/sunos/usr/lib /emul/sunos/usr/5lib
.fi
.Pp
.It
.Li cp SunOS:/usr/lib/lib*.so.*.* OpenBSD:/emul/sunos/usr/lib
.Pp
.It
.Li cp SunOS:/usr/5lib/lib*.so.*.* OpenBSD:/emul/sunos/usr/5lib
.Pp
.It
.Li cp SunOS:/usr/lib/ld.so OpenBSD:/emul/sunos/usr/lib/ld.so
.Pp
.It
If YP is going to be used, create a link:
.nf
.Li ln -s /var/run/ypbind.lock /etc/ypbind.lock
.fi
.El
.Pp
Alternatively, an NFS mount can accomplish the same
effect.
On the
.Ox
machine, do the following:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -inset -offset 123 -compact
.Pp
.It
.Li mkdir -p /emul/sunos/usr
.Pp
.It
.Li mount SunOS:/usr /emul/sunos/usr
.fi
.El
.Pp
This will place the SunOS libraries on the
.Ox
machine in a location where the SunOS compatibility code will look
first, in order to avoid conflict with the standard libraries.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr compat_svr4 8
.Sh BUGS
A list of things which fail to work in compatibility mode should
be here.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

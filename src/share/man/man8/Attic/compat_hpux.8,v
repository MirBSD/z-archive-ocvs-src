.Dt COMPAT_HPUX 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_hpux
.Nd setup for running HP-UX binaries under emulation
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
supports running HP-UX binaries.
This applies only to m68k systems (such as hp300 systems).
Most programs should work, such as Matlab 4.2c and the HP-UX X11R5 server.
Programs that will not work are fairly uncommon, and often involve very low
level hardware access.
.Pp
The HP-UX compatibility feature is active
for kernels compiled with the
.Nm COMPAT_HPUX
and
.Nm COMPAT_M68K4K
options enabled.
HP-UX for m68k uses 4 KB page sizes, and
.Ox
for all m68k platforms now uses 8 KB page sizes.
.Pp
A lot of programs are dynamically linked.
This means that the HP-UX shared libraries that the programs
depend on are also needed.
Additionally, a "shadow root"
directory for HP-UX binaries on the
.Ox
system will have to be created.
This directory is named
.Pa /emul/hpux .
Any file operations done by HP-UX programs run under
.Ox
will look in this directory first.
So, if a HP-UX program opens, for example,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Ox
will first try to open
.Pa /emul/hpux/etc/passwd ,
and if that does not exist open the
.Sq real
.Pa /etc/passwd
file.
It is recommended that HP-UX packages that include configuration
files, etc., be installed under
.Pa /emul/hpux ,
to avoid naming conflicts with possible
.Ox
counterparts.
Shared libraries should also be installed in the shadow tree.
.Pp
Generally, it will only be necessary to look for the shared libraries that
HP-UX binaries depend on the first few times that HP-UX programs are
installed on the
.Ox
system.
After a while, there will be a sufficient set of HP-UX shared libraries on the
system to be able to run newly imported HP-UX binaries without any extra work.
.Ss Setting up shared libraries
How to get to know which shared libraries HP-UX binaries need, and where to get
them?
Basically, there are 2 possibilities.
(When following these instructions, root privileges are required on the
.Ox
system to perform the necessary installation steps).
.Bl -enum
.It
Access to an HP-UX system:
These instructions apply to HP-UX 9.10 (the latest version of HP-UX available
for m68k-based systems), although the instructions should be similar for earlier
versions of HP-UX.
By far, the easiest method is to copy the essential files locally to the
.Ox
system.
.Pp
Use
.Xr tar 1 ,
or a similar utility, to collect the following files:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
All files in the
.Pa /usr/lib
directory ending in
.Li ".sl" .
There should be about 46 files and two soft links.
.It
All files in the
.Pa /lib
directory ending in
.Li ".sl" .
There should be 5 files.
.El
.Pp
Copy these files to the
.Ox
system, and extract them into
.Pa /emul/hpux .
The following files should be present:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/dld.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libc.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libm.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libM.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libcurses.sl
.It
.Pp
And a whole bunch of files in
.Pa /emul/hpux/usr/lib .
.El
Overall, HP-UX 9.10 has about 10 MB of shared libraries that will need to
be copied to the
.Ox
system.
.It
Access to an HP-UX system with its entire root drive exported via NFS:
In this case, simply mount the entire HP-UX system under
.Pa /emul/hpux .
For example, on the
.Ox
system, mount it as:
.Pp
.Dl $ mount -t nfs hpux-host.test.net:/ /emul/hpux
.Pp
Note that, in this case, the HP-UX emulation will use the configuration files
from the HP-UX system
.Po
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
for example,
.Pc
and that might not be desirable.
.El
.Ss Setting up X11R5
Although the
.Ox
based X11R5 server is the preferred way to run X, it is
possible to run the HP-UX X11R5 server instead.
To do so, a few additional files are necessary:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Pa /usr/bin/X11/X
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/grmd
.It
The shared libraries in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11R5 .
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/Motif1.2/libXm.sl
.It
All the subdirectories and files in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/fonts .
.It
All the files in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/nls/Xhp .
.It
All the files in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/extensions .
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XHPKeymaps
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XHPmodmap
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XPCmodmap
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/Xconsoles
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/X0screens
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/X0devices
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/X0pointerkeys
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/rgb.dir
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/rgb.pag
.El
.Pp
The following configuration steps will also need to be performed:
.Bl -enum
.It
Get and extract the
.Pa xbase.tgz
set for
.Ox
to provide the X11R6 clients which are going to be used with the new X server.
.It
Create the following directory for the X server to deposit its socket files
in:
.Pp
.Dl $ mkdir -p /usr/spool/sockets/X11
.Dl $ chmod 777 /usr/spool/sockets/X11
.It
Add the following lines to
.Pa /etc/rc.local
to create the necessary directories for the X server to deposit its files in,
when the system boots:
.Pp
.Dl $ mkdir /tmp/.X11-unix
.Dl $ chmod 777 /tmp/.X11-unix
.Dl $ ln -s /usr/spool/sockets/X11/0 /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
.It
It's also possible to link the X server to a more convenient location, such as:
.Pp
.Dl $ ln -s /emul/hpux/usr/bin/X /usr/X11R6/bin/X
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr options 4 ,
.Xr config 8
.Sh BUGS
It might not be possible to run the X server on multiple framebuffers,
even though both the X server and
.Ox
support them.

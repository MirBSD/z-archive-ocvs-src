log
@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm makedev
.Nd make system special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Ar device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm MAKEDEV
is a shell script normally used to install
special files.
It resides in the
.Pa /dev
directory, as this is the normal location of special files.
Arguments to
.Nm MAKEDEV
are usually of the form
.Ar device-name Ns Sy \&?
where
.Ar device-name
is one of the supported devices listed in section 4 of the
manual and
.Dq Sy \&?
is a logical unit number (0-9).
A few special arguments create assorted collections of devices and are
listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy std
Create the
.Em standard
devices for the system; for example the standard
.Tn UNIX
devices
.Pa /dev/console and /dev/tty;
the standard hardware dependent devices,
for example in the VAX family
the
.Tn VAX-11/780
console floppy device,
.Pa /dev/floppy ,
and
.Tn VAX-11/750
and
.Tn VAX-11/730
console cassette device(s),
.Pa /dev/tu?
devices would be made for the appropriate system.
.It Sy local
Create those devices specific to the local site.
This request causes the shell file
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV.local
to be executed.
Site specific commands, such as those used to setup dialup lines as
.Pa ttyd?
should be included
in this file.
.El
.Pp
Since all devices are created using
.Xr mknod 8 ,
this shell script is useful only to the superuser.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Either self-explanatory, or generated by one of the programs
called from the script.
Use
.Ql sh -x MAKEDEV
in case of
trouble.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr config 8 ,
.Xr mknod 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

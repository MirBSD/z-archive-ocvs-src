.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm YP
subsystem allows network management of passwd, group, and
hosts file entries through the functions
.Xr getpwent 3 ,
.Xr getgrent 3
and
.Xr gethostbyname 3 .
A number of other databases can be network-managed as well,
and have their respective functions.
.Nm YP
also provides hooks for numerous other client programs
such as
.Xr amd 8
and
.Xr bootparamd 8
to access distributed and shareable versions
of their maps through
.Nm YP .
.Pp
.Nm ypinit
is used to initialize
.Nm YP
as a master or a slave.
This creates various files in
.Pa /var/yp .
By default the
.Nm YP
server will be set up in backwards compatible mode.
To enable
.Dq secure
mode, the file
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile.yp
must be edited.
This
.Dq secure
mode is compatible with
.Ox
and
.Fx
clients.
.Pp
If set up as a slave, the required databases are automatically copied
from the specified server.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
client subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp/binding
exists.
The client subsystem can be turned on and off by creating or
deleting that directory.
.Xr ypbind 8
will create that directory if run by hand.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
server subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp/DOMAINNAME
exists.
This directory is automatically created by
.Xr ypinit 8
(which initializes the machine as a
.Nm YP
server).
.Pp
If
.Nm ypbind
cannot find a server, the system behaves the same way as Sun's code
does: it hangs.

.Sh HISTORY
This free
.Nm YP
subsystem is thought to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
It is, of course, not compatible with
.Nm NIS+
or any other
.Dq secure
.Nm YP
subsystem other than the native one.
.Pp
The name
.Nm YP
stands for Yellow Pee.
.Pp
The ypbind, most library components, and userland programs were implemented
by Theo de Raadt <deraadt@@theos.com>.
The current
.Xr getpwent 3
implementation was done by Jason Downs <downsj@@downsj.com>.
The server component was implemented by Mats O Jansson <moj@@stacken.kth.se>.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Xr portmap 8
be running before it is started.

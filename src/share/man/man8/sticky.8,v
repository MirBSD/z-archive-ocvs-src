.Dt STICKY 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sticky
.Nd sticky text and append-only directories
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A special file mode, called the
.Em sticky bit
(mode S_ISVTX),
is used to indicate special treatment
for shareable executable files and directories.
See
.Xr chmod 2
or
the file
.Pa /usr/include/sys/stat.h
for an explanation of file modes.
.Sh STICKY TEXT EXECUTABLE FILES
An executable shareable file whose sticky bit is set
will not be immediately discarded from swap space after execution.
The kernel will hoard the text segment of the file for future
reuse and avoid having to reload the program.
Shareable text segments are normally placed
in a least-frequently used cache after use,
and thus the `sticky bit' has little effect on commonly used text images.
.Pp
Sharable executable files are created with the
.Fl n
and
.Fl z
options of
the loader
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
Only the superuser can set the sticky bit
on a sharable executable file.
.Sh STICKY DIRECTORIES
A directory whose `sticky bit' is set
becomes an append-only directory, or, more accurately,
a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted.
A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed
by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and
the user is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory,
or the superuser.
This feature is usefully applied to directories such as
.Pa /tmp
which must be publicly writable but
should deny users the license to arbitrarily
delete or rename each others' files.
.Pp
Any user may create a sticky directory.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for details about modifying file modes.
.Sh BUGS
Since the text areas of sticky text executables are stashed in the swap area,
abuse of the feature can cause a system to run out of swap.
.Pp
Neither
.Xr open 2
nor
.Xr mkdir 2
will create a file with the sticky bit set.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh STICKY FILES
Historically, an executable shareable file which had the sticky bit set
was not immediately discarded from swap space after execution.
The kernel hoarded the text segment of the file for future reuse,
thus avoiding having to reload the program.
This is no longer true on modern systems;
the current virtual memory system keeps track of recently used executables,
making the sticky bit for files redundant.
The sticky bit can still be set on files, but without any effect.

Only the superuser can set the sticky bit on a file,

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm securelevel
.Nd securelevel and its effects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The
.Ox
kernel provides four levels of system security:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It \&-1 Em Permanently insecure mode
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
.Xr init 8
will not attempt to raise the securelevel
.It
may only be set with
.Xr sysctl 8
while the system is insecure
.It
otherwise identical to securelevel 0
.El
.It \ 0 Em Insecure mode
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
used during bootstrapping and while the system is single-user
.It
all devices may be read or written subject to their permissions
.It
system file flags may be cleared
.El
.It \ 1 Em Secure mode
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
default mode when system is multi-user
.It
securelevel may no longer be lowered except by init
.It
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
may not be written to
.It
raw disk devices of mounted file systems are read-only
.It
system immutable and append-only file flags may not be removed
.It
kernel modules may not be loaded or unloaded
.El
.It \ 2 Em Highly secure mode
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
all effects of securelevel 1
.It
raw disk devices are always read-only whether mounted or not
.It
.Xr settimeofday 2
and
.Xr clock_settime 2
may not set the time backwards or close to overflow
.It
.Xr pfctl 8
may no longer alter filter or nat rules
.It
the
.Va ddb.console
and
.Va ddb.panic
.Xr sysctl 8
variables may not be raised
.El
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Securelevel provides convenient means of
.Dq locking down
a system to a degree suited to its environment.
It is normally set at boot via the
.Xr rc.securelevel 8
script, or the superuser may raise securelevel at any time by modifying the
.Va kern.securelevel
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
However, only
.Xr init 8
may lower it once the system has entered secure mode.
A kernel built with
.Cm option INSECURE
in the config file will default to permanently insecure mode.
.Pp
Highly secure mode may seem Draconian, but is intended as a last line of
defence should the superuser account be compromised.
Its effects preclude
circumvention of file flags by direct modification of a raw disk device,
or erasure of a file system by means of
.Xr newfs 8 .
Further, it can limit the potential damage of a compromised
.Dq firewall
by prohibiting the modification of packet filter rules.
Preventing
the system clock from being set backwards aids in post-mortem analysis
and helps ensure the integrity of logs.
Precision timekeeping is not
affected because the clock may still be slowed.
.Pp
Because securelevel can be modified with the in-kernel debugger
.Xr ddb 4 ,
a convenient means of locking it off (if present) is provided
on highly secure systems.
This is accomplished by setting
.Va ddb.console
and
.Va ddb.panic
to 0 with the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rc.securelevel -compact
.It Pa /etc/rc.securelevel
commands that run before the security level changes
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr settimeofday 2 ,
.Xr mem 4 ,
.Xr options 4 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page first appeared in
.Ox 2.6 .
.Sh BUGS
The list of securelevel's effects may not be comprehensive.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

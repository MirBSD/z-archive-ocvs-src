.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm library-specs
.Nd shared library name specifications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
item in the port tree conforms to
.Sq lib_specs:[pkgspec]:directory[,-subpackage][,flavor ...][:target] ,
where
.Sq lib_specs ,
is a comma-separated list of
.Sq lib_spec
of the form:
.Sq libname[.major[.minor]] .
.Pp
All libraries that a port needs must be mentioned in that list, either 
directly or indirectly through recursive dependencies (except, of course,
for system libraries).
.Pp
The package system will embed correct dependency checks in the built
package, according to the normal shared library semantics: any library with
the same major number, and a greater or equal minor number will do.
.Pp
Therefore, porters must strive to respect correct shared library semantics
in their own ports: by bumping the minor number each time the interface is
augmented, and by bumping the major number each time the interface changes.
Note that adding functions to a library is an interface augmentation.
Removing functions is an interface change.
.Pp
The major.minor components of the library specification are used only as a build
time check.
Any library which is more recent than the given major.minor version will
do.
If the minor component is left empty, any minor will do.
If both components are left empty, any version will do.
If a specific major number is needed, use the form
.Sq libname.=major[.minor] .
.Pp
The 
.Sq pkgspec
part is always checked, both a build-time, and at
.Xr pkg_add 1
time.
If
.Sq pkgspec
is left empty, any package will do: in effect, the pkgspec used is
.Sq stem-* .
.Pp
If a given architecture does not support shared libraries, all
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
will be turned into simple
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
checks.
Failure to mention
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS
if the port needs anything beyond libraries from the dependent port will
lead to strange errors.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed

 * Currently, the mount system call is broken in the way it operates
 * and the vfssw[] table does not have a character string identifier
 * for the file system type; therefore, to remount a file system after
 * it has been mounted in the first place, the offset into the table
 * must be the same; this will be corrected in future patches, but
 * not right now.  At the same time the fstab format will need to
 * change to allow definition without mount of file systems.
 *
 * The flags field is a parameter to the init; this could be used to
 * change the file system operation: for instance, in ISOFS, this
 * could be used to enable/disable Rockridge extensions.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

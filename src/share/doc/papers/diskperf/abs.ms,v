Measurements were made of the UNIX file system
throughput for various I/O operations using the most attractive currently
available Winchester disks and controllers attached to both the
native busses (SBI/CMI) and the UNIBUS on both VAX 11/780s and VAX 11/750s.
The tests were designed to highlight the performance of single
and dual drive subsystems operating in the 4.2BSD
.I
fast file system
.R
environment.
Many of the results of the tests were initially counter-intuitive
and revealed several important aspects of the VAX implementations
which were surprising to us.
.PP
The hardware used included two  Fujitsu 2351A 
``Eagle''
disk drives on each of two foreign-vendor disk controllers
and two DEC RA-81 disk drives on a DEC UDA-50 disk controller.
The foreign-vendor controllers were Emulex SC750, SC780
and Systems Industries 9900 native bus interfaced controllers.
The DEC UDA-50 controller is a UNIBUS interfaced, heavily buffered
controller which is the first implementation of a new DEC storage
system architecture, DSA.
.PP
One of the most important results of our testing was the correction
of several timing parameters in our device handler for devices
with an RH750/RH780 type interface and having high burst transfer
rates.
The correction of these parameters resulted in an increase in
performance of over twenty percent in some cases.
In addition, one of the controller manufacturers altered their bus
arbitration scheme to produce another increase in throughput.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

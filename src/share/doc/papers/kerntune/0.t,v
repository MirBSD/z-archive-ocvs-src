This paper describes how the \fIgprof\fP profiler 
accounts for the running time of called routines
in the running time of the routines that call them.
It then explains how to configure a profiling kernel on
the 4.2 Berkeley Software Distribution of 
.UX
for the VAX\(dd

and discusses tradeoffs in techniques for collecting
profile data.
\fIGprof\fP identifies problems
that severely affects the overall performance of the kernel.
Once a potential problem areas is identified
benchmark programs are devised to highlight the bottleneck.
These benchmarks verify that the problem exist and provide
a metric against which to validate proposed solutions.
Two caches are added to the kernel to alleviate the bottleneck
and \fIgprof\fP is used to validates their effectiveness.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

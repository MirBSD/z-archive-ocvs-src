The 4.4BSD implementation of the Network File System (NFS)\** is

other NFS Version 2 Protocol (RFC1094) implementations but also
allows use of an alternate protocol that is hoped to provide better
performance in certain environments.
This paper will informally discuss these various protocol features and
their use.
There is a brief overview of the implementation followed
by several sections on various problem areas related to NFS
and some hints on how to deal with them.
.pp
Not Quite NFS (NQNFS) is an NFS like protocol designed to maintain full cache
consistency between clients in a crash tolerant manner. It is an adaptation
of the NFS protocol such that the server supports both NFS
and NQNFS clients while maintaining full consistency between the server and
NQNFS clients.
It borrows heavily from work done on Spritely-NFS [Srinivasan89], but uses
Leases [Gray89] to avoid the need to recover server state information
after a crash.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

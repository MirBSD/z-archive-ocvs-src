We thank Robert Elz for his ongoing interest in the new file system,
and for adding disk quotas in a rational and efficient manner.
We also acknowledge Dennis Ritchie for his suggestions
on the appropriate modifications to the user interface.
We appreciate Michael Powell's explanations on how
the DEMOS file system worked;
many of his ideas were used in this implementation.
Special commendation goes to Peter Kessler and Robert Henry for acting
like real users during the early debugging stage when file systems were
less stable than they should have been.
The criticisms and suggestions by the reviews contributed significantly
to the coherence of the paper.
Finally we thank our sponsors,
the National Science Foundation under grant MCS80-05144,
and the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DoD) under
ARPA Order No. 4031 monitored by Naval Electronic System Command under
Contract No. N00039-82-C-0235.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

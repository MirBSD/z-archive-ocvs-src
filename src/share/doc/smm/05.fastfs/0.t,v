This work was done under grants from
the National Science Foundation under grant MCS80-05144,
and the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DoD) under
ARPA Order No. 4031 monitored by Naval Electronic System Command under
Contract No. N00039-82-C-0235.
.FE
A reimplementation of the UNIX file system is described.
The reimplementation provides substantially higher throughput
rates by using more flexible allocation policies
that allow better locality of reference and can
be adapted to a wide range of peripheral and processor characteristics.
The new file system clusters data that is sequentially accessed
and provides two block sizes to allow fast access to large files
while not wasting large amounts of space for small files.
File access rates of up to ten times faster than the traditional
UNIX file system are experienced.
Long needed enhancements to the programmers'
interface are discussed.
These include a mechanism to place advisory locks on files, 
extensions of the name space across file systems,
the ability to use long file names,
and provisions for administrative control of resource usage.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

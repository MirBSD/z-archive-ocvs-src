The internal structure of the system is patterned
after the Xerox PUP architecture [Boggs79], while in certain
places the Internet
protocol family has had a great deal of influence in the design.
The use of software interrupts for process invocation
is based on similar facilities found in
the VMS operating system.
Many of the
ideas related to protocol modularity, memory management, and network
interfaces are based on Rob Gurwitz's TCP/IP implementation for the 
4.1BSD version of UNIX on the VAX [Gurwitz81].
Greg Chesson explained his use of trailer encapsulations in Datakit,
instigating their use in our system.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

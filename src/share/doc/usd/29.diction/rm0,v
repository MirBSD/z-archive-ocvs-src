Text processing systems are now in heavy use in many companies
to format documents.
With many documents stored
on line, it has become possible to use computers
to study writing style itself and to help writers
produce better written and more readable prose.
The system of programs described here is an initial step
toward such help.
It includes programs and a data base designed
to produce a stylistic profile of writing at the word and
sentence level.
The system measures read\%ability, sentence and word length,
sentence type, word usage, and sentence openers.
It also locates common examples of wordy phrasing and bad diction.
The system is useful for evaluating a document's style,
locating sentences that may be difficult to read or
excessively wordy, and determining
a particular writer's style over several documents.

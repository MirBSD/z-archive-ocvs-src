1.2
log
@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* fix every single Makefile for papers/USD/PSD/SMM
* improve <bsd.doc.mk> - tbl(1) is called by default now
* move programme definitions from <bsd.doc.mk> into <bsd.own.mk>
* move a bunch of compiler selection stuff from /etc/mk.conf
  into <bsd.own.mk> and improve it largely
* overhaul gcc-local(1) and style(9), referencing our licence
  template in the latter
* overhaul (mostly shorten and clarify) the COPYRIGHT file;
  make clear where the other licences (Apache, Sendmail, GNU, ...)
  are listed, by pathname and www URI
* employ new mechanism to check for paper/doc Makefiles/SUBDIRs
* fix mdoc macros
* merge more acronymes from NetBSD

This merge took me more than three hours, just FYI

The documents in this directory consist of various, miscellaneous, system docs:

	legal/		Licences and associated information
	html/		HTML documents for bind, curses, and lynx
	psd/		UNIX Programmer's Supplementary Documents
	smm/		UNIX System Manager's Manuals
	usd/		UNIX User's Supplementary Documents

The documentation in the psd, smm, and usd subdirectories are roff source,
and can be used to generate documents in any of the formats available to the
nroff(1) document formatting system.

Within any given subdirectory, simply typing:

	# make paper.ps

will generate a pre-formatted document in PostScript format, called `paper.ps'.
The document can be viewed with the help of a PostScript viewer, such as
`ghostview' or `gv', and the PostScript back-end `ghostscript'. See ports(7)
and packages(7) for further information on how to install this software.
The generation of postscript output needs an installed troff or GNU groff text
formatter, none of which is part of the MirOS system.

ASCII text format documents, suitable for viewing with a pager such as
less(1), can be generated by typing:

	# make paper.txt

However, the PostScript output is much prettier :)

The documentation in the html subdirectory can by viewed using any HTML-capable
browser such as lynx(1).

1.1.1.1
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

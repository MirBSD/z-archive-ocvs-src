@* replace all occurences of old eMail addresses of mine
  with their more recent counterparts
* no $Log keyword!
* update licence template to most recent version in files touched
* in some places, don't add our own licence boilerplate, just
  add my name to the others
* make dev/rndvar.h suitable for inclusion in asm code
* include dev/rndvar.h by in_cksum.s instead of
  hardcoding pool size
* ENTRY(a); ENTRY(b) -> NENTRY(a); ENTRY(b)
* RCS IDs belong into .comment not .text

@o don't install the OpenBSD license template any more
  this is not an OpenBSD patchkit after all (they forced it)
o reword the MirOS licence template application instructions a bit

The license template below is intended for new code in OpenBSD,
however I see a problem with it being possibly interpreted as a
copyleft license. The responsible OpenBSD guy says it's untrue;
I however urge people to use the MirBSD "licence.template" file
in this directory instead.

$OpenBSD: license.template,v 1.2 2003/06/03 22:37:00 david Exp $

Below is an example license to be used for new code in OpenBSD,
modeled after the ISC license.

It is important to specify the year of the copyright.  Additional years
should be separated by a comma, e.g.
    Copyright (c) 2003, 2004

If you add extra text to the body of the license, be careful not to
add further restrictions.

however I see a problem with it. The original UCB, BSD, MIT-style
licenses had a clause which says you must retain the (c) list
and the disclaimer. The template below has a clause which forces
the licensee to retain the (c) list and the permission notice,
effectively being a copyleft licence.
The OpenBSD maintainer, Todd Miller, has been informed, and he
states this is untrue. I however urge people to use the MirBSD
template, named "licence.template", in this directory, instead.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

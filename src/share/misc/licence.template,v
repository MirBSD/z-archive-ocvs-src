/*-
 * Copyright (c) year, year...
 *	First M. Last <user@@host.domain>
 *
 * Licensee is hereby permitted to deal in this work without restric-
 * tion, including unlimited rights to use, publicly perform, modify,
 * merge, distribute, sell, give away or sublicence, provided all co-
 * pyright notices above, these terms and the disclaimer are retained
 * in all redistributions or reproduced in accompanying documentation
 * or other materials provided with binary redistributions.
 *
 * Licensor hereby provides this work "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of
 * any kind, expressed or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by
 * applicable law, but with the warranty of being written without ma-
 * licious intent or gross negligence; in no event shall licensor, an
 * author or contributor be held liable for any damage, direct, indi-
 * rect or other, however caused, arising in any way out of the usage
 * of this work, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
 *-
 * OPTIONAL ADVERTISING CLAUSE:
 * Adding advertising clauses is not recommended, because they reduce
 * the interoperability of the licence and place, if overused, a huge
 * load on distributors. Still there are cases in which adding an ad-
 * vertising clause might be appropriate. To add an advertising clau-
 * se, insert the following paragraph in between the first and second
 * paragraph shown above:
 *
 * All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this soft-
 * ware must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes (material|software) (provided by|devel-
 *	oped (at|?(or owned )by|under|for?( use (in|with)))) <NAME>?(
 *	?, and (its|their|by other) contributors)?( (for|by) <NAME>).
 *
 * Please adapt the template above for your situation; items prefixed
 * with a question mark can be left out.
 * While not all possible expansions of the above ksh-like expression
 * are valid sentences, this is acceptable, as long as it remains im-
 * possible to construct a non-OSD-compliant license that matches the
 * pattern.
 *
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * When applying the template specify the year(s) of copyright; addi-
 * tional years should be separated by commas, not denoted by range.
 * If adding extra text be careful about _not_ adding any further re-
 * strictions; avoid adding text if ever possible.
 *
 * RATIONALE:
 * This licence template is the preferred licence for new files added
 * to MirOS, be it code, documentation or any other kind of data. The
 * licence is believed to be equivalent to the MIT or a 2-clause BSD-
 * style licence or the "historic permission clause" found at OSI[1],
 * OSD[2] compliant and compatible with the GNU GPLv2 if the optional
 * advertising clause is not used; it focuses on European law, but is
 * valid worldwide. OSI certification[4] mark should be possible.
 * In some droit d'auteur countries you cannot disclaim entire liabi-
 * lity; that's why this licence has been drafted to be equivalent to
 * a donation, where (e.g. in German law) you can only be held liable
 * if you insert malware (such as back doors) or intellectual proper-
 * ty of third parties, for which you have no licence to do that.
 *
 * ADDITIONAL NOTES:
 * For the MirOS project[3], applicable law is German law and site of
 * court is designated to be Bonn, Germany. When applying above temp-
 * late to your own work, site of court usually is your hometown, un-
 * less you specify a different one.
 * (The MirOS /usr/share/man/COPYRIGHT file has an additional clause,
 * which sets forth the chosen site of court and law. The template is
 * not implying anything, thus believed to be GNU GPL-compatible.)
 *
 * Licensor and Licensee are not defined by the licence text, neither
 * is there a statement like "perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable".
 * These terms have been omitted because usually your country's copy-
 * right/droit d'auteur law already defines them, and in latter coun-
 * tries it's often impossible to give out irrevocable, perpetual li-
 * cences (confirmed for Germany, where the original author can revo-
 * ke it after thirty (30) years).
 *
 * We believe you are not liable for code inserted which is intellec-
 * tual property of third parties, if you were not aware of the fact,
 * and remove it as soon as you get aware of it (that's why it's cal-
 * led a "gross neglicence").
 *
 * If you are German and unfamiliar with some of the terms above, the
 * dictionary at http://dict.leo.org/ may help you a bit unless it is
 * down again; we used it as a references as well.
 *
 * REFERENCES:
 * [1] http://www.opensource.org/licenses/historical.php
 * [2] http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php
 * [3] http://mirbsd.de/ gives you a start.
 * [4] We submitted this licence template to OSI, but within 2 months
 *     there has been no notable improvement; licence.template,v 1.20
 *     is considered the formal MirBSD list of terms and conditions.

@The MirOS project has decided on a new licence template, with working
over hours to redesign the text; some discussion from outside was
greatly appreciated.

We will now not change this template text any more, unless it contains
serious flaws; you might consider this the "MirOS licence 1.0" if you
want (or even file for an OSI certification yourself; we won't do).

All the content in the MirWiki will have to be under this licence
(credits for _this_ idea go to OpenBSD, who placed their PF howto
 under an open licence as well).

Subject: AW: ifross.de - Informationen GPL, aber BSD?

Hallo Thorsten,

es ist eine ganz richtige Beobachtung, dass die meisten rechtlichen
Stellungnahmen die GPL betreffen. Der Grund liegt ganz einfach darin, dass
dort wesentlich mehr Fragen und Probleme auftreten als bei BSD-Lizenzen. In
unserem Buch und auch in einigen Artikeln finden sich Ausführungen zu
BSD-Lizenzen. Die Haftungs- und Gewährleistungsproblematik ist nahezu
identisch, ebenso das Thema AGB und Englisch als Vertragssprache.
Urheberrechtlich werden umfassende Nutzungsrechte an jedermann eingeräumt.
Wenn man Spindlers Argumente aufgreift, sollte man noch "make available to
the public" als Nutzungsform explizit aufführen.

This is a licence template that is preferred to be used
for new code in MirBSD. This is slightly different from
the original UCB licence, but only in wording (should
be equivalent to the two-clause one), and from the one
used in OpenBSD, which looks like a copyleft licence to
me, even if it may be not one.

Please specify the year of the copyright. Additional
years should be separated by a comma, not by ranges.

Don't add extra text to the licence, except if you must.
Be careful about not adding further restrictions.

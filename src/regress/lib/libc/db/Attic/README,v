@nuke regression tests

noone actually uses them (I've run them about half a dozen times only),
some of the tests (eg. everything PF) are broken, some of the code is
broken... and the adventurous are invited to use CVS and fix them,
maybe on a tagged branch.

To run the tests, enter "make regress".

Fairly large files (the command files) are built in this directory during
the test runs, and even larger files (the database files) are created in
"/var/tmp".  If the latter directory doesn't exist, set the environmental
variable TMPDIR to a directory where the files can be built.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The script file consists of lines with an initial character which is
the command for that line, or an initial character indicating a key
or data entry for a previous command.

Legal command characters are as follows:

c: compare a record
	+ must be followed by [kK][dD]; the data value in the database
	  associated with the specified key is compared to the specified
	  data value.
e: echo a string
	+ writes out the rest of the line into the output file; if the
	  last character is not a carriage-return, a newline is appended.
f: set the flags for the next command
	+ no value zero's the flags
g: do a get command
	+ must be followed by [kK]
	+ writes out the retrieved data DBT.
o [r]: dump [reverse]
	+ dump the database out, if 'r' is set, in reverse order.
p: do a put command
	+ must be followed by [kK][dD]
r: do a del command
	+ must be followed by [kK] unless R_CURSOR flag set.
S: sync the database
s: do a seq command
	+ must be followed by [kK] if R_CURSOR flag set.
	+ writes out the retrieved data DBT.

Legal key/data characters are as follows:

D [file]: data file
	+ set the current data value to the contents of the file
d [data]:
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the line.
K [file]: key file
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the file
k [data]:
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the line.

Blank lines, lines with leading white space, and lines with leading
hash marks (#) are ignored.

Options to dbtest are as follows:

	-d: Set the DB_LOCK flag.
	-f: Use the file argument as the database file.
	-i: Use the rest of the argument to set elements in the info
	    structure.  If the type is btree, then "-i cachesize=10240"
	    will set BTREEINFO.cachesize to 10240.
	-o: The rest of the argument is the output file instead of
	    using stdout.
	-s: Don't delete the database file before opening it, i.e.
	    use the database file from a previous run.

Dbtest requires two arguments, the type of access "hash", "recno"
or "btree", and the script name or "-" to indicate stdin.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

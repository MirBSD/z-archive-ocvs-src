@nuke regression tests

noone actually uses them (I've run them about half a dozen times only),
some of the tests (eg. everything PF) are broken, some of the code is
broken... and the adventurous are invited to use CVS and fix them,
maybe on a tagged branch.

/*
** Intel/DVI ADPCM coder/decoder.
**
** The algorithm for this coder was taken from the IMA Compatibility Project
** proceedings, Vol 2, Number 2; May 1992.
**
** Version 1.2, 18-Dec-92.
**
** Change log:
** - Fixed a stupid bug, where the delta was computed as
**   stepsize*code/4 in stead of stepsize*(code+0.5)/4.
** - There was an off-by-one error causing it to pick
**   an incorrect delta once in a blue moon.
** - The NODIVMUL define has been removed. Computations are now always done
**   using shifts, adds and subtracts. It turned out that, because the standard
**   is defined using shift/add/subtract, you needed bits of fixup code
**   (because the div/mul simulation using shift/add/sub made some rounding
**   errors that real div/mul don't make) and all together the resultant code
**   ran slower than just using the shifts all the time.
** - Changed some of the variable names to be more meaningful.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

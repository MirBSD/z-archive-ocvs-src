@nuke regression tests

noone actually uses them (I've run them about half a dozen times only),
some of the tests (eg. everything PF) are broken, some of the code is
broken... and the adventurous are invited to use CVS and fix them,
maybe on a tagged branch.

.Sh NAME
.Nm autest
.Nd test audio encoding output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm autest
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens the
.Xr audio 4
device specified with the
.Fl f
flag
or
.Pa /dev/sound
if not specified,
and iterates through all of the encodings supported by the device playing
a 440Hz tone in the proper format.
The tone should sound almost identical in each of the formats.
.Pp
.Nm
can produce tones in any of the following formats and will skip other
formats if supported by the device:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX
.It Cm mulaw
8bit U-Law companded
.It Cm alaw
8bit A-Law companded
.It Cm adpcm
4 bit adaptive differential pulse code modulation
.It Cm ulinear
8 bit unsigned linear.
.It Cm ulinear_le
16 bit unsigned linear little endian
.It Cm ulinear_be
16 bit unsigned linear big endian
.It Cm slinear
8 bit signed linear (twos complement)
.It Cm slinear_le
16 bit signed linear little endian (twos complement)
.It Cm slinear_be
16 bit signed linear big endian (twos complement)
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh BUGS
The ADPCM encoding sounds very noisy on CS4231 (it's probably incorrect).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import OpenBSD repository of CTM 3155 (roughly today at noon).
Mostly in order to go 3.3-current and ease further merges of
both OpenBSD and ELFdiffs after the MirBSD has been enabled
to build again.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

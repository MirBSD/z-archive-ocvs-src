@nuke regression tests

noone actually uses them (I've run them about half a dozen times only),
some of the tests (eg. everything PF) are broken, some of the code is
broken... and the adventurous are invited to use CVS and fix them,
maybe on a tagged branch.

# To run full regression tests you just need two steps:
# 1. make depend
# 2. make regress
#
# A normal "make" is not necessary and will simply do the same thing
# as "regress" (possibly with more bugs). This allows us to include
# compilation as a part of the regression test.
#
# To get a log of test results set the REGRESS_LOG make variable to
# a log file, use an absolute path.
# To mail the test results set the REGRESS_MAIL make variable to an
# email address, preferably 'regress@@openbsd.org'.
# To skip the really slow tests, set the REGRESS_SKIP_SLOW variable.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

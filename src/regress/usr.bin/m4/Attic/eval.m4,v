@nuke regression tests

noone actually uses them (I've run them about half a dozen times only),
some of the tests (eg. everything PF) are broken, some of the code is
broken... and the adventurous are invited to use CVS and fix them,
maybe on a tagged branch.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

@nuke regression tests

noone actually uses them (I've run them about half a dozen times only),
some of the tests (eg. everything PF) are broken, some of the code is
broken... and the adventurous are invited to use CVS and fix them,
maybe on a tagged branch.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

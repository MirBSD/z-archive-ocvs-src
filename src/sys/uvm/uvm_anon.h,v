 * when the processes referencing it go away.    an anonymous page of
 * virtual memory is described by the following data structure:

				   [an_lock.  also, it is ok to read
				   an_swslot if we hold an_page PG_BUSY] */
};

/*
 * a pool of vm_anon data structures is allocated and put on a global
 * free list at boot time.  vm_anon's on the free list use "an_nxt" as
 * a pointer to the next item on the free list.  for active vm_anon's
 * the data can be in one of the following state: [1] in a vm_page
 * with no backing store allocated yet, [2] in a vm_page with backing
 * store allocated, or [3] paged out to backing store (no vm_page).
 *
 * for pageout in case [2]: if the page has been modified then we must
 * flush it out to backing store, otherwise we can just dump the
 * vm_page.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

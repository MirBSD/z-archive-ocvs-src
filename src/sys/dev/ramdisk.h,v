1.3
log
@fix a much deeper error in the ramdisk subsystem by ensuring (in
rdstrategy) that before checking a field of a disklabel the disklabel
is always valid.
ANSI, KNF and then indent(1) a bit while here.

your weekly ~/.indent.pro additions:
-Tbuf
-Tdevice
-Tdisklabel
-Tproc
-Trd_conf
-Trd_softc
-Tuio

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/*
 * This file defines rbus (pseudo) class
 *
 * What is rbus?
 * 
 *  Ths rbus is a recursive bus-space administrator.  This means a
 *  parent bus-space administrator, which usually belongs to a bus
 *  bridge, makes some child bus-space administrators and gives
 *  (restricted) bus-space for children.  There are a root bus-space
 *  administrator which maintains whole bus-space.
 *
 * Why recursive?
 *
 *  The recursive bus-space administration has two virtues.  The
 *  former is this modelling matches the actual memory and io space
 *  management of bridge devices well.  The latter is the rbus is
 *  distributed management system, so it matches well with
 *  multi-thread kernel.
 *
 * Abstraction
 *
 *  The rbus models bus-to-bus bridge into three way: dedicate, share
 *  and slave.  Dedicate means that the bridge has dedicate bus space.
 *  Share means that the bridge has bus space, but this bus space is
 *  shared with other bus bridges.  Slave means the bus bridge which
 *  does not have it own bus space and ask a parent bus bridge for bus
 *  space when a client requests bus space to the bridge.

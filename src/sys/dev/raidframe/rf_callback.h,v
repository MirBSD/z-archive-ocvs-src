 * The reconstruction code must manage concurrent I/Os on multiple drives.
 * It sometimes needs to suspend operation on a particular drive until some
 * condition occurs. We can't block the thread, of course, or we wouldn't
 * be able to manage our other outstanding I/Os. Instead we just suspend
 * new activity on the indicated disk, and create a callback descriptor and
 * put it someplace where it will get invoked when the condition that's
 * stalling us has cleared. When the descriptor is invoked, it will call
 * a function that will restart operation on the indicated disk.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

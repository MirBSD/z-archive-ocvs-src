@Define a method for ISA devices to allocate two IRQ
instead of just one. Some cards just cry for it.
Help from miod@@openbsd:

Breaking every single driver that uses DMA.

Contrary to the NetBSD, config(8) which define symbolic constants to
access the locators in the array, OpenBSD still uses hard-coded numeric
indexes, so the only way to add new locators without breaking things is
to add them _last_ in the locators list.

        sys/sys        : mman.h
        sys/uvm        : uvm_mmap.c

Log message:
Change mquery() function call signature to be the same a mmap(). It
needs the prot/flags info and passing the addresses via arg/return allows
it to be traced via ktrace better than an in/out paramter.
This adds a new mquery syscall and renames the old one to omquery.
New kernel _MUST_ be built, booted, and 'make includes' before building
ld.so with this change.

@Pull in ISDN support from NetBSD, push out the old
one with the "I require you to send me a postcard"
licence.

This enables building a kernel with ISDN support
(it's just slower and like 200 KiB bigger), but
disables isdnd from userland and needs different
manpages and other fixes from NetBSD.

Also added:
 - support for the callout API from NetBSD, which
   is in fact our stolen new-style timeout API,
   just with a bit more overhead and different names
   for the structure
 - some includes sync with NBSD
 - a shitload of kludges to make ISDN build

This needs security, style and bloat audits fast.
And testing.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sync MirBSD main source tree against OpenBSD-current,
which should be fairly stable after the Hackathon now.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

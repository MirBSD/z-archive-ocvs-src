Here are the results of my reorganization work on the zs driver.
Everything compiles and appears to work.

Enjoy!
Gordon Ross

----------------------------------------------------------------
This design has a "zs controller" named "zsc" with three
flavors of child drivers that can be attached above it.
The three child drivers are:
	zstty:	normal RS-232 line
	kbd:	sun keyboard
	ms:	sun mouse

Note that the machine-dependent parts are:
	arch/sun3/include/z8530var.h
	arch/sun3/dev/zs.c
(replicate those for new systems)

The Sun hardware dependent parts (Sun3 and SPARC) are:
	kd*	sun keyboard/display console stuff
	event*	sun "firm event" stuff

----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is how the autoconfig looks on a sun3:

zsc0 at obio0 addr 0x0 level 6 softpri 3
kbd0 at zsc0 channel 0
ms0 at zsc0 channel 1
zsc1 at obio0 addr 0x20000 level 6 softpri 3
zstty0 at zsc1 channel 0 (console)
zstty1 at zsc1 channel 1


----------------------------------------------------------------
Config lines:

In any config file (i.e. GENERIC, NEW_ZS, ...)
Note {kbd,ms} are sun-specific.

#
# New console (zs) stuff
#
zsc0 at obio? addr ?
zsc1 at obio? addr ?
kbd0 at zsc0 channel 0
ms0  at zsc0 channel 1
zstty* at zsc? channel ?


----------------------------------------------------------------
In conf/files.sun3

#
# Console (zs) related stuff
#
device zsc at obio {channel = -1}
file arch/sun3/dev/zs.c 		zsc needs-flag
file dev/ic/z8530sc.c			zsc

device zstty at zsc: tty
file dev/ic/z8530tty.c			zstty needs-flag

define zsevent
file dev/sun/event.c			zsevent

device kbd at zsc: zsevent
file dev/sun/kbd.c			kbd needs-flag
file dev/sun/kbd_tables.c 		kbd
file arch/sun3/dev/kd.c 		kbd

device ms at zsc: zsevent
file dev/sun/ms.c			ms needs-flag

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

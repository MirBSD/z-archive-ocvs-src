@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

@Import OpenBSD source tree from CVS (anoncvs canada)
of roughly 12:00 UTC today. Bumps us to OpenBSD 3.4
and makes source/ports in sync. Hopefully.

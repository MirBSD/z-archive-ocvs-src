/* Implementation of most common lm700x routines */

/*
 * Sanyo LM7001 Direct PLL Frequency Synthesizer
 *    ??? See http://www.redsword.com/tjacobs/geeb/fmcard.htm
 *
 * The LM7001J and LM7001JM (used in Aztech/PackardBell cards) are PLL
 * frequency synthesizer LSIs for tuners. These LSIs are software compatible
 * with LM7000 (used in Radiotrack, Radioreveal RA300, some Mediaforte cards),
 * but do not include an IF calculation circuit.
 *
 * The FM VCO circuit includes a high-speed programmable divider that can
 * divide directly.
 *
 * Features:
 * Seven reference frequencies: 1, 5, 9, 10, 25, 50, and 100 kHz;
 * Band-switching outputs (3 bits);
 * Controller clock output (400 kHz);
 * Serial input circuit for data input (using the CE, CL and DATA pins).
 *
 * The LM7001J and LM7001JM have a 24-bit shift register.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

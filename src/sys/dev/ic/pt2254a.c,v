 *  PT2254A is an electronic volume controller IC utilizing CMOS Technology
 *  specially designed for use in audio equipment. It has two built-in
 *  channels making it highly suitable for mono and stereo sound applications.
 *  Through the specially designated signals that are applied externally to
 *  the data, clock and strobe input pins, PT2254A can control attenuation
 *  and channel balance.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

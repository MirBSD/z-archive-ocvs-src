/*
 * This is a PCI shim for the Aironet PC4500/4800 wireless network
 * driver. Aironet makes PCMCIA, ISA and PCI versions of these devices,
 * which all have basically the same interface. The ISA and PCI cards
 * are actually bridge adapters with PCMCIA cards inserted into them,
 * however they appear as normal PCI or ISA devices to the host.
 *
 * All we do here is handle the PCI match and attach and set up an
 * interrupt handler entry point. The PCI version of the card uses
 * a PLX 9050 PCI to "dumb bus" bridge chip, which provides us with
 * multiple PCI address space mappings. The primary mapping at PCI
 * register 0x14 is for the PLX chip itself, *NOT* the Aironet card.
 * The I/O address of the Aironet is actually at register 0x18, which
 * is the local bus mapping register for bus space 0. There are also
 * registers for additional register spaces at registers 0x1C and
 * 0x20, but these are unused in the Aironet devices. To find out
 * more, you need a datasheet for the 9050 from PLX, but you have
 * to go through their sales office to get it. Bleh.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

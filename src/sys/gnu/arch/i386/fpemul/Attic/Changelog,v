@$OpenBSD: Changelog,v 1.1 1996/08/27 10:32:38 downsj Exp $

This file contains the changes made to W. Metzenthem's 387 FPU
emulator to make it work under NetBSD.

a, Changes to make it compile:
	
	1 - Changed the #include's to get the appropriate .h files.
	2 - Renamed .S to .s, to satisfy the kernel Makefile.
	3 - Changed the C++ style // comments to /* */
	4 - Changed the FPU_ORIG_EIP macro. A letter from bde included
		in the package suggested using tf_isp for using instead
		of the linux __orig_eip. This later turned out to interfere
		with the user stack, so i created a separate variable, stored
		in the i387_union.
	5 - Changed the get_fs_.. put_fs_.. fns to fubyte,fuword,subyte,
		suword.
	6 - Removed the verify_area fns. I don't really know what they do,
		i suppose they verify access to memory. The sufu routines
		should do this.

b, Changes to make it work:
	
	1 - Made math_emulate() to return 0 when successful, so trap() won't
		try to generate a signal.
	2 - Changed the size of the save87 struct in /sys/arch/i387/include/
		npx.h to accomodate the i387_union.
	
d, Other changes:

	1 - Removed obsolate and/or linux specific stuff.
	2 - Changed the RE_ENTRANT_CHECK_[ON|OFF] macro to
		REENTRANT_CHECK([ON|OFF]) so indent can grok it.
	3 - Re-indented to Berkeley style.
	4 - Limited max no of lookaheads. LOOKAHEAD_LIMIT in fpu_entry.c

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

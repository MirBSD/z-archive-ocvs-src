1.4
log
@* regenerate generated files (MAKEDEV, syscalls)
* regenerate i386->FLOPPY and sparc->GENERIC manually
* remove sun4 support from sparc kernel, because our CFLAGS
  prevent v7 from working anyways
* patch in Claudio Jeker's tap-for-tun diff, and fix his
  spelling and whitespace-at-eol (he delivers good KNF tho)
* move cccp.1 manpage to where gcc-local.1 landed as well
  (the FSF COPYING is a bit more restrictive, but easy enough;
  we have worse things in usr.sbin/?????/)
* bcopy, bcmp, bzero removal
* memcpy -> memmove where memcpy() is not available
* overhaul of headers (bcopy, too)
* a bunch more NULL and time_t fixes

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

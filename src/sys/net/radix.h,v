@* regenerate generated files (MAKEDEV, syscalls)
* regenerate i386->FLOPPY and sparc->GENERIC manually
* remove sun4 support from sparc kernel, because our CFLAGS
  prevent v7 from working anyways
* patch in Claudio Jeker's tap-for-tun diff, and fix his
  spelling and whitespace-at-eol (he delivers good KNF tho)
* move cccp.1 manpage to where gcc-local.1 landed as well
  (the FSF COPYING is a bit more restrictive, but easy enough;
  we have worse things in usr.sbin/?????/)
* bcopy, bcmp, bzero removal
* memcpy -> memmove where memcpy() is not available
* overhaul of headers (bcopy, too)
* a bunch more NULL and time_t fixes

@Jumbo patch from wbx@@ to replace the
bcopy(3), bcmp(3) and bzero(3) func-
tions, having been deprecated earli-
er, by their ISO counterparts, name-
ly memmove(3) and the gcc3-optimized
memcmp(3) and memset(3) functions.

I didn't read every single line (be-
cause of the time of day), but looks
fine and builds through. I just nee-
ded to nuke three cases of whitespa-
ce at EOL. Good work wbx@@.

I've also sprinkled in a few patches
of mine addressing the issue that in
some kernel header files, bcopy() is
used as well... also there have been
quite some string cleaning fixes and
a missing header.

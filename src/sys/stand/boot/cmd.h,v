1.2

@The boot loader seems to have been broken since the MirOS #7 releases.
Apologies to Jannis Konrad for blaming on his (nevertheless
totally broken) hardware. Thanks to Bill Gates and his company
for writing DEBUG.COM which allowed me to get into my system
again, since it apparently can't boot our /boot from CD-ROM
(this is still not fixed, but it's fine in bochs, and my box
 doesn't even get as far as the Lsrt0 message,
	MirOS boot(8) 2.54 srt0 initializing
 when booting from CD, so it must be broke too).

While here, rewrite several chunks of the code, and extend the
size of the argv[] array for boot commands to make echo work.

Tested:
 bochs CD passed
 mybox CD failed
 mybox HD passed
 mybox MS-DOS passed

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

@clean up after cvs
fix some stuff

in the hope to fully have removed sys_mhint... they implemented
it in the name of sys_mquery *d'oh*

Some Alpha AXP OSF/1 binaries directly use the facilities provided by
the Mach kernel that is the basis for OSF/1.  These include (but are
surely not limited to) 'dd', 'ps', and 'w'.

Invariably, the symptom that these binaries display is that they crash
with an "unimplemented system call" trap (SIGSYS signal) for a syscall
that has a negative number.  In general, binaries that use the Mach
syscalls appear to invoke task_self() as their first syscall.

The name, number, and number of arguments for each Mach syscall is
given below; this information was gleaned by looking through the OSF/1
libmach.a's object files with dbx, then double-checked against the
contents of OSF/1's <mach/syscall_sw.h>.

These calls would be very difficult to implement properly in the
OSF/1 emulation code; by its very nature, NetBSD is not Mach, and we
don't and can't provide the underlying facilities that it does.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

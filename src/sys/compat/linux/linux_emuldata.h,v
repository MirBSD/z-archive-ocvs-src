NetBSD did in fact make this change. I've ported their changes over. There
was one thing that I wasn't sure of. NetBSD has a linux_emuldata struct that
contains the cached brk value in addition to some other NetBSD specific
linux emulation data. Since the only thing left in the struct (after I
removed the cruft) was the cached brk value, I considered eliminating the
struct and just caching the value in the proc struct. However, since it may
be likely that some of the NetBSD linux features get ported over in the
future I left the struct.

From: Kurt Miller <truk@@optonline.net>
(should fix sunjdk-linux-1.3 with ports/emulators/redhat/base/
 instead of kludging in the old ports/emulators/redhat/base62/)

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

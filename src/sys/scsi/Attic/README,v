################## Using the scsi system ##################
--------------making devices------------
see st(1) and st(4) for info on tape devices.

---------ioctl definitions-------------
User accessable structures (e.g. ioctl definitions) have been
placed in sys/cdio, sys/sgio and sys/chio (based after sys/mtio for
the ioctls for mag tapes (including st).
General scsi ioctls are found in sys/scsiio.h.

-----------cd-rom-----------------
Cdrom audio is only supported at all for cdroms that use SCSI2 audio
definitions.

-------------media changer---------------
Once again courtesy of grefen@@convex.com (in germany)
I have not tested this but he assures me it's ready for testing.
If anyone has an exabyte tape changer or similar, 
contact the author for information regarding the control interface
and program.

WARNING: This has not been tested for a LONG TIME!

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs

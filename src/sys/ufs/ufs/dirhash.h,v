/*
 * For fast operations on large directories, we maintain a hash
 * that maps the file name to the offset of the directory entry within
 * the directory file.
 *
 * The hashing uses a dumb spillover to the next free slot on
 * collisions, so we must keep the utilisation low to avoid
 * long linear searches. Deleted entries that are not the last
 * in a chain must be marked DIRHASH_DEL.
 *
 * We also maintain information about free space in each block
 * to speed up creations.

/*
 * Dirhash uses a score mechanism to achieve a hybrid between a
 * least-recently-used and a least-often-used algorithm for entry
 * recycling. The score is incremented when a directory is used, and
 * decremented when the directory is a candidate for recycling. When
 * the score reaches zero, the hash is recycled. Hashes are linked
 * together on a TAILQ list, and hashes with higher scores filter
 * towards the tail (most recently used) end of the list.
 *
 * New hash entries are given an inital score of DH_SCOREINIT and are
 * placed at the most-recently-used end of the list. This helps a lot
 * in the worst-case case scenario where every directory access is
 * to a directory that is not hashed (i.e. the working set of hash
 * candidates is much larger than the configured memry limit). In this
 * case it limits the number of hash builds to 1/DH_SCOREINIT of the
 * number of accesses.

@Import OpenBSD as of today again (seems pretty stable, I hope)

Prominent changes: more bgpd, tcpmd5; tcpdump/isakmpd fixes

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

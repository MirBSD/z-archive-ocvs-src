 * Routing support for X.25
 *
 * We distinguish between two cases:
 * RTF_HOST:
 * 	rt_key(rt)	X.25 address of host
 *	rt_gateway	SNPA (MAC+DLSAP) address of host
 *	rt_llinfo	pkcb for rt_key(rt)
 *
 * RTF_GATEWAY
 *	rt_key(rt)	X.25 address of host or suitably masked network
 *	rt_gateway	X.25 address of next X.25 gateway (switch)
 *	rt_llinfo	rtentry for rt_gateway address
 *			ought to be of type RTF_HOST
 *
 *
 * Mapping of X.121 to pkcbs:
 *
 * HDLC uses the DTE-DCE model of X.25, therefore we need a many-to-one
 * relationship, i.e.:
 *
 * 	{X.121_a, X.121_b, X.121_c, ..., X.121_i} -> pkcb_0
 *
 * LLC2 uses the DTE-DTE model of X.25, resulting effectively in a
 * one-to-one relationship, i.e.:
 *
 *	{X.121_j} 	->	pkcb_1a
 *	{X.121_k}	->	pkcb_1b
 *	...
 *	{X.121_q}	->	pkcb_1q
 *
 * It might make sense to allow a many-to-one relation for LLC2 also,
 *
 *	{X.121_r, X.121_s, X.121_t, X.121_u} -> pkcb_2a
 *
 * This would make addresses X.121_[r-u] essentially aliases of one
 * address ({X.121_[r-u]} would constitute a representative set).
 *
 * Each one-to-one relation must obviously be entered individually with
 * a route add command, whereas a many-to-one relationship can be
 * either entered individually or generated by using a netmask.
 *
 * To facilitate dealings the many-to-one case for LLC2 can only be
 * established via a netmask.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

 * usually there are groups of machines using the same CPU chips, eg.
 *	MicroVAX II
 *	MicroVAX 2000
 *	VAXstation 2000

 * On the other hand the above machines are quite differnet wrt. the

 * and thus can't share this code. 
 *
 * It's also possible to find groups of machines which have enough

 * code between them. Eg.
 *	VAXstation 2000
 *	VAXstation 3100 (which models ???)
 *	VAXstation 4000 (which models ???)
 * use the same (nonexistent "virtual") system-bus and thus can share

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

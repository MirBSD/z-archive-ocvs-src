@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

                How to use copy
                ------------------


Edlabel is a standalone program that can copy multiple volumes
from disk/tape to disk/tape. Mostly it is used to copy the 
miniroot filesystem onto the swap partition during initial
installation.
You will here be guided through a session, things with ^^^^ under
is typed in by the user, comments are within /* */.
This is an installation from TK50.


Nboot
: copy
  ^^^^
10480+468+34868 start 0x0

copy: 
This program will read miniroot from tape/floppy/disk 
and install this miniroot onto disk.

Specify the device to read from as xx(N,0), where
xx is the device-name and N is the unit-number, e.g.
"tms(0,1)" for the first TMSCP-tape (TK50),
"ra(2,0)" for the third MSCP-disk/floppy (RX33/RX50)

device to read from ? tms(0,1) /* Tape 0, file 1 */
                      ^^^^^^^^
Specify number of blocks to transfer. Usually this is
sizeof(miniroot) / 512.
It's safe to transfer more blocks than just the miniroot.

number of blocks ? 4096  /* Miniroot size is 4096 block */
                   ^^^^
If your miniroot is split into volumes, then you must
specify the number of blocks per volume.
(e.g. 800 blocks per RX50, 2400 blocks per RX33)

number of blocks per volume ? [4096] 

Make sure unit tms(0,1) is online and holds the proper volume.
Then type 'g' to Go or 'a' to Abort.

OK to go on ? [g/a] g   /* g == go, a == abort */
                    ^
Reading ... Reading of miniroot done. (4096 blocks read)


Now specify the device to write miniroot to as xx(N,1)
where xx is the drive type and N is the drive number.
For example: ra(0,1) refers to MSCP drive #0, b partition

Root disk ? : ra(0,1) /* Actually DUA0, partition b (swap) */
              ^^^^^^^^^
Initializing partition ... done.
(4096 blocks written.)

Halt the machine and reboot from distribution media,
giving second partition as part to mount as root. Ex:
: ra(0,1) for ra disk 0, hp(2,1) for massbuss disk 2

Halt/Reboot the machine NOW.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

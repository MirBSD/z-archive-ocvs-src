@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

 * This file may seem a bit stylized, but that so that it's easier to port.

 * process_read_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Get the current user-visible register set from the process
 *	and copy it into the regs structure (<machine/reg.h>).
 *	The process is stopped at the time read_regs is called.
 *
 * process_write_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Update the current register set from the passed in regs
 *	structure.  Take care to avoid clobbering special CPU
 *	registers or privileged bits in the PSL.
 *	The process is stopped at the time write_regs is called.
 *
 * process_sstep(proc)
 *	Arrange for the process to trap after executing a single instruction.
 *
 * process_set_pc(proc)
 *	Set the process's program counter.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

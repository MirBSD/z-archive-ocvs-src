log
@current bootstrap tree:
 * debugging is on for (current, to be replaced) srt0.S
 * /boot works
 * dosboot.com goes away, /boot will be a MS-DOS .COM compatible
   programme soon enough, and so nobody tries to load a kernel
   from msdosfs right now (though that might come as well)
 * booting from floppy in bochs works (tested)
 * pbr_ffs is incompatible with prior versions, because /boot
   now comes as binary, not ELF32 file

log
@add "dosboot.com", a /boot with the ELF header replaced
with a small MS-DOS executable chaining into the boot
loader after relocating itself (TESTED)

a pity that my CD-ROM drive doesn't want to boot

@I'm sick that every piece of code has got to have its own version
number - just use the MirOS patchlevel for the bootloader.

Also, rename /usr/mdec/pbr_ffs to ffspbr for a better tabcomplete,
now that we've got the pxeboot

.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd installs a bootstrap on an FFS disk or partition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl M
.Op Fl v
.Oo Fl s Ar sectors-per-track Oc
.Oo Fl h Ar tracks-per-cyl Oc
.Ar boot
.Ar ffspbr
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
is used to install a
.Dq first-stage
boot program into the boot area
of an FFS disk partition, and initialize the table of block numbers the
PBR programme uses to load the second-stage boot program.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag_opt
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, printing out the LBA addresses that are stored in
.Ar ffspbr
along with lots of other information.
.It Fl s Ar sectors-per-track
Used to specify the sectors-per-track value if the drive has
sector translation activated, and
.Nm
is unable to determine the translated geometry.
.\" If not specified, this defaults to d_nsectors from the disklabel.
If not specified, this defaults to the value retrieved from the BIOS
at boot time, available via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.It Fl h Ar tracks-per-cyl
Used to specify the tracks-per-cylinder value if the drive has
sector translation activated, and
.Nm
is unable to determine the translated geometry.
.\" If not specified, this defaults to d_ntracks from the disklabel.
If not specified, this defaults to the value retrieved from the BIOS
at boot time, available via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.It Fl M
Installs the first-stage boot loader,
.Nm ffspbr ,
into the master boot record.
The partition table does not get overwritten.
The
.Pa /boot
file had better be not too fragmented for this to work.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width biosboot
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the mounted file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
This should be a full pathname.
.It Ar ffspbr
The name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program,
usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/ffspbr .
.It Ar disk
The name of the disk containing the partition in which the second-stage
boot program resides and the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
This can either be specified in short form (i.e.,
.Sq sd0
or
.Sq wd0 ) ,
or as the explicit raw device node, such as
.Pa /dev/rsd0c
or
.Pa /dev/rwd0c .
.Pp
Note that you must be in single-user mode or have your kernel in
insecure mode (see the
.Xr sysctl 8
.Va kern.securelevel
variable or
.Pa /etc/rc.securelevel )
to enable access to the raw partition of a mounted disk.
.Pp
The
.Sq c
partition is always used to represent the
.Dq entire
disk on i386.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical use is
.Pp
.Dl # cp /usr/mdec/boot /boot
.Dl # /usr/mdec/installboot -v -n /boot /usr/mdec/ffspbr wd0
.Pp
And if the information supplied looks right, run the above without the
.Fl n
flag.
If you are upgrading an old system, you may need to preface
the above steps with some more steps... and do the following:
.Pp
.Dl boot the floppy.fs filesystem floppy
.Dl # fsck /dev/rsd0a
.Dl # mount /dev/sd0a /mnt
.Dl # cp /usr/mdec/boot /mnt/boot
.Dl # /usr/mdec/installboot -v /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/ffspbr sd0
.Pp
If you need to find the BIOS geometry of the disk for
.Fl s
and
.Fl h
you can use the boot block command:
.Pp
.Dl boot> machine diskinfo
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr fdisk 8 ,
.Xr init 8
.Sh BUGS
The disklabel
.Va d_type
field must be set to a value of
.Dq 4.2FFS .
.Pp
You cannot run
.Nm installboot
for a drive/partition other than the one you want the
.Pa /boot
to be loaded from.

@I'm sick that every piece of code has got to have its own version
number - just use the MirOS patchlevel for the bootloader.

Also, rename /usr/mdec/pbr_ffs to ffspbr for a better tabcomplete,
now that we've got the pxeboot

@$MirBSD: src/sys/arch/i386/stand/README,v 1.10 2004/01/03 18:29:49 tg Exp $


02.08.2004

Version number is now revision and patchlevel of MirOS at
that time, and pbr_ffs is now ffspbr.

03.01.2004

As requested by this Jedi/Sector One guy aka Frank Denis,
support for moving the disklabel BIOS partition to an ex-
tended partition entry has been added.  In that case, the
first stage boot sector (pbr_ffs) is still written to the
partition boot sector, so you must use a chain loader not
supplied with MirOS currently (or copy the pbr bootsector
into the extended partition's, not overwriting the parti-
tion table info (last 66/0x42 bytes)).

21.12.2003

New boot code (v2.64) does actually work around broken
BIOSes so much that it boots on my hardware. The negative
part is that you need mkisofs for it (although Nero or
old mkisofs/mkhybrid should be fine on not-so-broken BIOS
versions). You can also cp /usr/mdec/boot /dos/boot.com
and use that for booting a kernel located on a FFS slice.
No FAT support yet, although that is planned.

01.12.2003

Do some real-life testing. Some BIOSes give back errors
when bochs doesn't.

28.11.2003

Take back inlining memmove() -> boot has size constraints.
It works on about 56224 bytes, but not with 57332 bytes.

25.11.2003

New boot code (v2.51+) is incompatible with old boot code.

09.11.2003

Newly written (i386) machine-dependent code ought to be
a well written example and documentation of the GNU as
mode "intel_syntax noprefix".
As disassembler, NASM is preferred (ports/devel/nasm).
As assembler it was as well preferred, but it isn't part
of the base, and someone has to get all the errors out of
gas ;-)  Additionally, they don't support pushf/pushfd
correctly (one has to use pushfw, which is plain wrong!).

# hmm, no copyright

Ok, just a couple quick pointers to people hacking on this stuff.  These
are things that I have found out, and hopefully will make things easier
for the next dude.

First of all, don't trust gas to get the opcodes right.  Look at the
listing (-Wa,a), and check them.  In particular, check for EIP relative
and absolute addressing.  Some of this stuff is pretty hairy in that way.

Debugging this stuff is hell.  Remember that stores directly to video
memory will go a long way towards tracking how far things are getting,
especially when you don't have the BIOS handy.  (movl %0x07410741, 0xb8000)


The basics of the /boot system is the following:

biosboot: 512 bytes of the first sector on the disk/partition.  This loads
/boot (or whatever you did with installboot) into ram.

boot: starts protected mode, and process simple command line.
There is some magic here in terms of the placement and size of the various
segments, as this piece of code has to switch between real and protected
mode many times to load the next piece of the puzzle, /bsd.gz.

bsd: The kernel itself, can be gzipped if ya want.


The basic steps at creating a boot floppy for yourself, and checking things
out are the following:

1.) Compile a kernel you wish to use.
2.) Compile the new stand stuff.
3.) Mount floppy.
4.) Copy boot and kernel to floppy.  (Kernel could be gzipped if needed)
5.) Run installboot on floppy.
6.) Unmount floppy.
7.) Test...

A quick pasto for ya:

Sun Apr  6 20:16:55 CDT 1997
----------------------------

Ok, from general comments on icb leads me to believe this stuff has a ways
to go.  First of all, there are a lot of debug frobs to video memory at
0xb8000 when DEBUG* is defined.  Also, if you boot a kernel, and find that
you get a scrolling screen, press pause to get it to stop.  You should then
be able to read the register dump.

Note, currently gzipped kernel do not work.  Do not know the reason, we are
working on resolving that.


Fri Apr 11 14:18:41 CDT 1997
----------------------------

Ok, yeah, the .gz kernel gets to the probe (and then cacks later due to
no swap).  Things should start working nicer from now on.  The problem
was with -DSAVE_MEMORY, I believe that the stuff in libsa/cread.c was
not (and still is not with the define) being done right.  I suspect
the inflateInit2(), which had a parameter changed from -15 to -11.
The problem manifested itself by loading a corrupted kernel.  On the
other hand, it checksummed ok though, so there might be a small bug in
the libz stuff.  Also, I don't understand libz, but I do know that
things work without -DSAVE_MEMORY, and don't with it defined.


Mon Apr 21 15:25:42 EDT 1997
----------------------------

Now memory limits are not a concern. No more restrictions on placement
and size of code/data. It would be an idea to move PMMM code from kernel
into /boot to use low memory somehow.  Also remember that the upper 64k is
used by apm, so do not grow heap too much... Low 64k is used for real mode
IDT, BIOS data, stack for /boot, so stack is big enough (about 60k).
All the magic w/ prot-real mode interface now in one place <libsa/gidt.S>.
BIOS (and DOS soon) interrupt entry points are now just as simple as
they are in real mode (just use a macro BIOSINT, which shifts int number
by 0x20, that all! ;).


Sat May 31 12:06:37 EDT 1997
----------------------------

usleep(int15,f86) BIOS call is not supported well in all the BIOSes,
especially some laptop BIOSes and Compaq machines. Everybody is encouraged
to use sleep instead, it's known to work.


Thu Jul 17 21:24:42 EDT 1997
----------------------------

Return to the way when code has to be less than 64k, or better say that
whole gidt.S code must be in the 1st 64k of /boot .text section.
This saves about 2k of code (idt initialization).
APM information is now gathered and passed to the locore.s upon kernel
startup as a pointer to the struct apm_connect_info.


Wed Aug 27 16:30:51 EDT 1997
----------------------------

BIOS boot device number is passed to the kernel along with BIOS geometry
for that drive and other info. APM connect info is passed as well not in
that apm0 structure, so apm0 will become a slave on bios0 soon.
To get your /boot installed properly on a hardrive you have to load /bsd
from that hd/partition (since only boot drive geometry is passed).


Mon Oct 13 16:41:18 CDT 1997
----------------------------

Clean up memprobe some, adding support for querying the BIOS for the
memory map.  Resort to the old invasive probe if all else fails.  Add
preliminary support for passing a memory map to the kernel, instead of
cnvmem/extmem.  This should make weird boards easier to support in the
future.


Tue Jan  6 19:51:43 CST 1998
----------------------------

Query and pass PCI BIOS information to the kernel.  This should help in
determening the correct configuration mode to use.  Pass in cnvmem/extmem
as the user sets the amount of memory with the 'set memory' command, or
the amount calculated by the memory find/probe routines.

The new bootloader code works on CD-R, hard disc and MS-DOS in real broken
hardware, as well as on CD ISO in bochs.

@The boot loader seems to have been broken since the MirOS #7 releases.
Apologies to Jannis Konrad for blaming on his (nevertheless
totally broken) hardware. Thanks to Bill Gates and his company
for writing DEBUG.COM which allowed me to get into my system
again, since it apparently can't boot our /boot from CD-ROM
(this is still not fixed, but it's fine in bochs, and my box
 doesn't even get as far as the Lsrt0 message,
	MirOS boot(8) 2.54 srt0 initializing
 when booting from CD, so it must be broke too).

While here, rewrite several chunks of the code, and extend the
size of the argv[] array for boot commands to make echo work.

Tested:
 bochs CD passed
 mybox CD failed
 mybox HD passed
 mybox MS-DOS passed

@woohoo, mirabile learns gcc inline assembly :-)
well, sort of. it sucks, but there isn't a way around it.
as bonus, /usr/mdec/boot grows a Kibibyte or so larger, but
should be faster (as if that mattered...)

bump version, clean up code (including indenting), sync fdisk

@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

As assembler as well, but it isn't part of the base, and
someone has to get all the errors out of gas ;-)

@assembly language code in MirBSD is supposed to be
well-written and document the intel_syntax mode of gas.

@yay. I am your god. (Or root. What is difference?)

Tested:
 * boot cd0, kernel cd0:gzip'd
 * boot cd0, kernel cd0:stripped
 * boot cd0, kernel cd0:stripped and gzip'd
 * boot cd0, kernel fd1:floppyM34.fs
 * boot fd0, kernel fd1:floppyM34.fs
 * boot hd0, kernel fd1:floppyM34.fs
 * boot cd0, kernel hd0:floppyM34.fs
 * boot hd0, kernel hd0:floppyM34.fs

All tests have been passed in bochs, except the one below.
No tests at all have been performed on real hardware.

Tested and failed:
 * boot cd0, kernel cd0:plain bsd.rd

NM: fixed some minor bits in files touched, too

@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

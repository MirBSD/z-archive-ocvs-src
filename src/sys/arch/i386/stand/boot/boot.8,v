@I'm sick that every piece of code has got to have its own version
number - just use the MirOS patchlevel for the bootloader.

Also, rename /usr/mdec/pbr_ffs to ffspbr for a better tabcomplete,
now that we've got the pxeboot

.Dt BOOT 8 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot ,
.Nm boot.cfg
.Nd
i386-specific second-stage bootstrap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The main purpose of this program is to load the system kernel while dealing
with the downfalls of the PC BIOS architecture, as well as with problems
arising during an El Torito boot from a CD-ROM drive on broken hardware.
.Pp
As described in
.Xr boot_i386 8 ,
this program is loaded by the
.Xr ffspbr 8
primary bootstrap loader if loaded from a floppy or hard disc drive.
If being loaded from CD, that action is taken directly by the BIOS.
It can also be started as if it were a native MS-DOS .COM executable.
This provides a convenient way to load the kernel.
This programme acts as an enhanced boot monitor for PC systems, providing
a common interface for the kernel to start from.
.Pp
The
.Nm
programme can be loaded by the BIOS directly from an ISO9660 filesystem.
The emulation mode must be set to
.Dq 0 - No Emulation
for this programme to work correctly.
Some hardware needs in addition to that a specification that only the
first sector (first four virtual sectors, 2048 Bytes) of the file are
to be loaded, because they cannot load more.
The load address is \fB0x07C0:0x0000\fR.
.Pp
Basic operations include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Detecting and switching between multiple consoles.
.It
Loading kernels from any device supported by your system BIOS,
including bootable CD-ROM drives if the
.Nm
programme itself acts as a boot image.
.It
Loading kernels compressed by
.Xr gzip 1 .
.It
Passing system parameters queried from the BIOS to the kernel.
.It
Providing an interactive command line.
.El
.Pp
The sequence of its operation is as follows: initialization,
parsing the configuration file, then an interactive command line.
While at the command line you have 5 seconds to type any commands, if needed.
If time expires, the kernel will be loaded according to
the current variable settings (see the
.Nm set
command).
Each time a kernel load fails, the timeout is increased by one second.
The sequence of
.Nm
operations is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
Set up a protected mode environment which catches and reports processor
exceptions and provides a simple protected-mode BIOS interface.
.It
Probe for console devices, which includes the (default) PC VGA+Keyboard
console
.Pq Li pc0
and up to four serial consoles
.Pf ( Li com0
through
.Li com3 )
connected to the serial ports.
Display messages to the default console about the devices found.
.It
Detect memory.
Conventional memory is detected by querying the BIOS.
Extended memory is detected by probing page-by-page through the address
space, rather than asking the BIOS; many BIOS's cannot report larger than
64M of memory.
All memory found is reported to the default console device.
.It
Probe for APM support in the BIOS.
Display a message if support is present.
.It
If the file
.Pa /etc/boot.cfg
exists on the filesystem
.Nm
was loaded from, open and parse it.
This file may contain any commands
.Nm
accepts at the interactive prompt.
Though default settings usually suffice, they can be changed here.
.It
The header line
.Pp
.Dl >> MirBSD boot x.xx
.Dl booting from device 80h
.Pp
is displayed to the active console, where
.Ar x.xx
is the version number of the
.Nm
program and
.Ar 80h
is the BIOS idea of the drive
.Nm
was booted from, followed by the
.Pp
.Dl boot>
.Pp
prompt, which means you are in interactive mode and may enter commands.
There may be machine-specific output in between the greeting
message and the boot prompt.
If you do not,
.Nm
will proceed to load the kernel with the current parameters after the
timeout period has expired.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
attempts to load the kernel executable
.Pa /bsd .
If that fails, it will attempt to load
.Pa /obsd
and then
.Pa /bsd.old .
If it fails to find any of these files,
and no alternative kernel image has been specified,
the system will be unable to boot.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are accepted at the
.Nm
prompt:
.Bl -tag -width shorten
.It boot Op Ar image Op Fl acds
Boots the kernel image specified by
.Ar image
with any options given.
Image specification consists of a pair
.Ar device : Ns Ar filename ;
either or both can be omitted (`:' is not needed if both are omitted),
in which case values from
.Nm
variables will be used.
.Pp
When selecting the
.Ar device
to boot from,
.Nm
makes no distinction between SCSI and IDE type drives;
they are detected as
.Sq hd
devices.
Therefore, to boot kernel
.Pa /bsd
from slice
.Sq a
on the first hard drive
.Pq irrespective of device type ,
specify
.Dq boot hd0a:/bsd .
.Bl -tag -width _a_
.It Fl a
Causes the kernel to ask for the
.Nm root
device to use.
.It Fl c
Causes the kernel to go into
.Xr boot_config 8
before performing
.Xr autoconf 4
procedures.
.It Fl d
Causes the kernel to drop into
.Xr ddb 4
at the earliest convenient point.
.It Fl s
Causes the kernel to boot single-user.
.El
.It echo Op Ar args
Displays
.Ar args
on the console device.
.It help
Prints a list of available commands and machine dependent
commands, if any.
.It machine Op Ar command
Issues machine-dependent commands.
These are defined for i386 architecture:
.Bl -tag -width diskinfo
.It Nm diskinfo
Prints a list of hard disks installed on your system including:
BIOS device number, and the BIOS geometry.
.It Nm memory
If used without any arguments this command will print out
the memory configuration as determined through BIOS routines.
Otherwise the arguments would specify the expressions to modify the
memory configuration.
The expression would have a form of:
.Pp
.Dl [+-]<size>@@<address>
.Pp
Meaning to add(+) or exempt(-) the specified by the
.Ar <size>
amount of memory at the location specified by the
.Ar <address>
argument.
Both size and base address could be specified as octal,
decimal, or hexadecimal numbers, as accepted by the
.Xr strtoul 3
routine.
Memory segments are not required to be adjacent to each other,
the only requirement is that there is real physical memory under
the range added.
For example:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
machine mem +0x2000000@@0x1000000
.Ed
.Pp
would add 32M of memory right after the first 16M.
The other useful command would be to withdraw a range
of memory from OS usage (might be wrongfully reported as
useful by the BIOS).
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
machine mem -0x100000@@0xf00000
.Ed
.Pp
which effectively excludes 15-16M range from the map of useful memory.
.It Nm oldbios
Turns on the so-called
.Dq Old BIOS / Soekris helper ,
which restricts
.Nm
from requesting more than one sector a time.
.It Nm regs
Prints contents of processor registers if compiled with
.Em DEBUG .
.El
.It ls Op Ar directory
Prints contents of the specified
.Ar directory
in long format including: attributes and file type, owner, group,
size, filename.
.It reboot
Reboots the machine by initiating a warm boot procedure.
.It set Op Ar varname Op Ar value
If invoked without arguments, prints a list of variables and their values.
If only
.Ar varname
is specified, displays contents of that variable.
If
.Ar varname
and
.Ar value
are both specified, sets that variable to the given value.
Variables include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width boothow
.It Nm addr
Address at which to load the kernel.
.It Nm debug
Debug flag if
.Nm
was compiled with DEBUG defined.
.It Nm device
Boot device name (e.g.,
.Li fd0a ,
.Li hd0a ) .
.It Nm howto
Options to pass to the loaded kernel.
.It Nm image
File name containing the kernel image.
.It Nm timeout
Number of seconds boot will wait for human intervention before
booting the default kernel image.
.It Nm tty
Active console device name (e.g.,
.Li com0 ,
.Li com1 ,
.Li pc0 ) .
Currently, only the first serial port
.Pq Li com0
is supported for console on i386.
.El
.It stty Op Ar device Op Ar speed
Displays or sets the
.Ar speed
for a console
.Ar device .
If changing the baudrate for the currently active console,
.Nm
offers you five seconds of grace time before committing the change
to allow you to change your terminal's speed to match.
If changing speed
.Em not
for the active console, the baudrate is set for the
.Em next
time you switch to a serial console.
The baudrate value is not used for the
.Li pc0
console.
.Pp
The default baudrate is 9600bps.
.It time
Displays system time and date.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/biosbootxx -compact

.It Pa /usr/mdec/pxeboot
PXE bootstrap
.It Pa /boot
system bootstrap
.It Pa /etc/boot.cfg

.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Boot the default kernel:
.Pp
.Dl boot> boot
.Pp
Remove the 5 second pause at boot-time permanently, causing
.Nm
to load the kernel immediately without prompting:
.Pp
.Dl # echo \&"boot\&" > /etc/boot.cfg
.Pp
Use serial console.
A null modem cable should connect the specified serial port to a terminal.
Useful for debugging.
.Pp
.Dl boot> set tty com0
.Pp
Invoke the serial console at every boot:
.Pp
.Dl # echo \&"set tty com0\&" > /etc/boot.cfg
.Pp
Boot the kernel named
.Pa /bsd
from the second hard disk in
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
This mechanism allows for the explicit enabling and disabling of devices
during the current boot sequence, as well as the modification
of device parameters.
Once booted, such changes can be made permanent by using
.Xr config 8 Ns 's
.Fl e
option.
.Pp
.Dl boot> boot hd1a:/bsd -c
.Pp
Attention: the ISO 9660 filesystem interface supports only
.Dq short
(i.e. MS-DOS like 8.3) file names.

.Sh HISTORY
This program was written by Michael Shalayeff for
.Ox 2.1 .
The
.Nm cdboot
version appeared in
.Mx 8 .
Up to, and including,
.Ox
(all versions) and
.Mx 7 ,
the
.Nm boot.cfg
file was called
.Nm boot.conf
instead.
The change for
.Mx 8
was done to accommodate CD-ROM and MS-DOS based booting.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

By default,
.Nm
attempts to load the kernel executable
.Pa /bsd .
If that fails, it will attempt to load
.Pa /obsd
and then
.Pa /bsd.old .
If it fails to find any of these files,
and no alternative kernel image has been specified,
the system will be unable to boot.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any

a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

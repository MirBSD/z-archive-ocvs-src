/*
 * i386 MMU hardware structure:
 *
 * the i386 MMU is a two-level MMU which maps 4GB of virtual memory.
 * the pagesize is 4K (4096 [0x1000] bytes), although newer pentium
 * processors can support a 4MB pagesize as well.
 *
 * the first level table (segment table?) is called a "page directory"
 * and it contains 1024 page directory entries (PDEs).   each PDE is
 * 4 bytes (an int), so a PD fits in a single 4K page.   this page is
 * the page directory page (PDP).  each PDE in a PDP maps 4MB of space
 * (1024 * 4MB = 4GB).   a PDE contains the physical address of the
 * second level table: the page table.   or, if 4MB pages are being used,
 * then the PDE contains the PA of the 4MB page being mapped.
 *
 * a page table consists of 1024 page table entries (PTEs).  each PTE is
 * 4 bytes (an int), so a page table also fits in a single 4K page.  a
 * 4K page being used as a page table is called a page table page (PTP).
 * each PTE in a PTP maps one 4K page (1024 * 4K = 4MB).   a PTE contains
 * the physical address of the page it maps and some flag bits (described
 * below).
 *
 * the processor has a special register, "cr3", which points to the
 * the PDP which is currently controlling the mappings of the virtual
 * address space.
 *
 * the following picture shows the translation process for a 4K page:
 *
 * %cr3 register [PA of PDP]
 *      |
 *      |
 *      |   bits <31-22> of VA         bits <21-12> of VA   bits <11-0>
 *      |   index the PDP (0 - 1023)   index the PTP        are the page offset
 *      |         |                           |                  |

 *
 * the i386 caches PTEs in a TLB.   it is important to flush out old
 * TLB mappings when making a change to a mappings.   writing to the
 * %cr3 will flush the entire TLB.    newer processors also have an
 * instruction that will invalidate the mapping of a single page (which
 * is useful if you are changing a single mappings because it preserves
 * all the cached TLB entries).
 *
 * as shows, bits 31-12 of the PTE contain PA of the page being mapped.
 * the rest of the PTE is defined as follows:
 *   bit#	name	use
 *   11		n/a	available for OS use, hardware ignores it
 *   10		n/a	available for OS use, hardware ignores it
 *   9		n/a	available for OS use, hardware ignores it
 *   8		G	global bit (see discussion below)
 *   7		PS	page size [for PDEs] (0=4k, 1=4M <if supported>)
 *   6		D	dirty (modified) page
 *   5		A	accessed (referenced) page
 *   4		PCD	cache disable
 *   3		PWT	prevent write through (cache)
 *   2		U/S	user/supervisor bit (0=supervisor only, 1=both u&s)
 *   1		R/W	read/write bit (0=read only, 1=read-write)
 *   0		P	present (valid)
 *
 * notes:
 *  - on the i386 the R/W bit is ignored if processor is in supervisor
 *    state (bug!)
 *  - PS is only supported on newer processors
 *  - PTEs with the G bit are global in the sense that they are not
 *    flushed from the TLB when %cr3 is written (to flush, use the
 *    "flush single page" instruction).   this is only supported on
 *    newer processors.    this bit can be used to keep the kernel's
 *    TLB entries around while context switching.   since the kernel
 *    is mapped into all processes at the same place it does not make
 *    sense to flush these entries when switching from one process'
 *    pmap to another.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

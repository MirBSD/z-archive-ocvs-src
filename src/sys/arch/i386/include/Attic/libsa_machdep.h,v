@nuke that bad idea of mine to have a machine-dependent libsa header,
to be used eg. for inlining memmove()

why was this a bad idea? inlining increases size of code, which is bad,
because code doesn't work after that any more

@build the system through, fix remaining issues
sync distrib set lists
take back inlining memmove() because the boot loader must be <57000 bytes
(the exact number is unknown) for cdboot to function

@woohoo, mirabile learns gcc inline assembly :-)
well, sort of. it sucks, but there isn't a way around it.
as bonus, /usr/mdec/boot grows a Kibibyte or so larger, but
should be faster (as if that mattered...)

bump version, clean up code (including indenting), sync fdisk

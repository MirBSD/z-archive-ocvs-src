@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Pull in ISDN support from NetBSD, push out the old
one with the "I require you to send me a postcard"
licence.

This enables building a kernel with ISDN support
(it's just slower and like 200 KiB bigger), but
disables isdnd from userland and needs different
manpages and other fixes from NetBSD.

Also added:
 - support for the callout API from NetBSD, which
   is in fact our stolen new-style timeout API,
   just with a bit more overhead and different names
   for the structure
 - some includes sync with NBSD
 - a shitload of kludges to make ISDN build

This needs security, style and bloat audits fast.
And testing.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

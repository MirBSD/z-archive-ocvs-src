@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm setnetbootinfo
.Nd configure network bootstrap program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm setnetbootinfo
.Op Fl vf
.Op Fl o Ar infile
.Oo
.Fl a Ar ether-address | Fl h Ar ether-host
.Oc
.Ar netboot
.Nm setnetbootinfo
.Op Fl v
.Fl u o Ar outfile Ar infile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm setnetbootinfo
utility configures the OpenBSD/alpha network bootstrap program so
that it can be used to bootstrap systems with old firmware revisions.
.Pp
The OpenBSD/alpha network bootstrap program needs to have the ethernet
address of the interface being used to boot the system available when
querying other hosts on the network for bootstrapping information.
Alpha systems with old firmware revisions provide no way for
network bootstrap programs to determine the ethernet address of
the interface that they are booting from, and so the OpenBSD/alpha
network bootstrap program must find that information in another way.
(Newer firmware revisions include the ethernet address in the name of
the device that is being booted from.)
The
.Nm
utility encodes an ethernet address (and other information) directly
into the network bootstrap program.
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a Ar ether-address
Encode the given ethernet address into the network bootstrap program.
(This option and the
.Fl h
option are mutually exclusive.)
.It Fl f
Force the address information being encoded in the bootstrap
program to be used regardless of whether or not the bootstrap
program can get address information from the booting system's
firmware.
.It Fl h Ar ether-host
Encode the ethernet address of the specified host into the network
bootstrap program.  The host's name is translated to an ethernet
address using the
.Xr ether_hostton 3
function.
(This option and the
.Fl a
option are mutually exclusive.)
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Output the resulting bootstrap program into the file named by
.Ar outfile ,
replacing it if it already exists.  If the
.Fl o
flag is not specified, the output file name will be
the name of the input bootstrap program concatenated with a
period and the digits of the ethernet address being encoded.
For instance, if the input file is named
.Pa /usr/mdec/netboot
and is being configured to encode the ethernet address
.Li 08:00:2b:bd:5d:fd ,
then the default output file name would be
.Pa /usr/mdec/netboot.08002bbd5dfd .
It is safe to set the output file name to be the same as the
input file name; the input file is read in its entirety before
the output file is modified.
.It Fl u
Remove configuration information from the specified network
bootstrap program.  If this option is used, an output file name must be
specified with the
.Fl o
option, and neither the
.Fl a
or the
.Fl h
options may be specified.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

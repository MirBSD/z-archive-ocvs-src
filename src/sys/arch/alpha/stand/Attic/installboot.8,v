@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8 alpha
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install disk bootstrap software
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl nv
.Ar boot
.Ar bootxx
.Ar rawdiskdevice
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm installboot
utility prepares a disk for bootstrapping.
.Pp
The OpenBSD/alpha disk bootstrap software is split into two parts:
a small first-stage boot program that is written into the disklabel
area of a disk
.Po
and hence is limited in size to 7680 bytes
.Pc ,
and a second-stage boot program that resides in the filesystem proper
.Po
typically with the name
.Pa /boot
.Pc .
The first-stage boot program is loaded into memory by the SRM console
software.  After receiving control of the system, it loads the
second-stage boot program from a set of filesystem block numbers that
have been
hard-coded into it by
.Nm installboot .
The second-stage boot program locates and loads the kernel.
.Pp
The second-stage boot program and the prototype code for the
first-stage boot program can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx ,
respectively.
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
may be installed simply by copying it to the root directory of the
partition you wish to boot from, but after it is installed
.Nm installboot
.Em must
be run.
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm installboot
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width rawdiskdevice
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar bootxx
The name of the prototype file for the first-stage boot program.
.It Ar rawdiskdevice
The name of the device corresponding to the raw whole-disk partition (the
.Dq raw partition )
of the disk on which the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pa boot
resides in the FFS file system mounted on
.Pa /
from
.Dq sd0a ,
you would install the first-stage boot program on the disk
(and therefore make the disk bootable) by using the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
installboot /boot /usr/mdec/bootxx /dev/rsd0c
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
The OpenBSD/alpha boot blocks can only load kernels from disks'
.Dq a
partitions.  (However, the second-stage boot
program may be located on any FFS file system partition
on the disk.)
.Pp
.Nm Installboot
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the disks' raw partition.
That is not allowed with the kernel
.Dv securelevel
variable
.Po
see
.Xr sysctl 8
.Pc
set to a value greater than one, or with
.Dv securelevel
set to one if the
.Dq boot
program resides in a file system on the disk's raw partition.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The alpha
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .

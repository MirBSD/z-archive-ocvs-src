@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

 * DMA support for the AMD 751 (``Irongate'') core logic chipset.
 *
 * The AMD 751 is really unlike all of the other Alpha PCI core logic
 * chipsets.  Instead, it looks like a normal PC chipset (not surprising,
 * since it is used for Athlon processors).
 *
 * Because of this, it lacks all of the SGMAP hardware normally present
 * on an Alpha system, and there are no DMA windows.  Instead, a memory
 * bus address is a PCI DMA address, and ISA DMA above 16M has to be
 * bounced (this is not unlike the Jensen, actually).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

 * The kiockey structure apparently gets and/or sets keyboard mappings.
 * It seems to be kind of useless, but X11 uses it (according to the
 * comments) to figure out when a Sun 386i has a type-4 keyboard but
 * claims to have a type-3 keyboard.  We need just enough to cause the
 * appropriate ioctl to return the appropriate magic value.
 *
 * KIOCGETKEY fills in kio_entry from kio_station.  Not sure what tablemask
 * is for; X sets it before the call, so it is not an output, but we do not
 * care anyway.  KIOCSDIRECT is supposed to tell the kernel whether to send
 * keys to the console or to X; we just send them to X whenever the keyboard
 * is open at all.  (XXX may need to change this later)
 *
 * Keyboard commands and types are defined in kbd.h as they are actually
 * real hardware commands and type numbers.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

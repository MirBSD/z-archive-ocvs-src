 * Extended-precision arithmetic.

 * We hold the notion of a `carry register', which may or may not be a
 * machine carry bit or register.  On the SPARC, it is just the machine's
 * carry bit.
 *
 * In the worst case, you can compute the carry from x+y as
 *	(unsigned)(x + y) < (unsigned)x
 * and from x+y+c as
 *	((unsigned)(x + y + c) <= (unsigned)x && (y|c) != 0)
 * for example.

/*
 * We have three kinds of add:
 *	add with carry:					  r = x + y + c
 *	add (ignoring current carry) and set carry:	c'r = x + y + 0
 *	add with carry and set carry:			c'r = x + y + c
 * The macros use `C' for `use carry' and `S' for `set carry'.
 * Note that the state of the carry is undefined after ADDC and SUBC,
 * so if all you have for these is `add with carry and set carry',
 * that is OK.
 *
 * The same goes for subtract, except that we compute x - y - c.
 *
 * Finally, we have a way to get the carry into a `regular' variable,
 * or set it from a value.  SET_CARRY turns 0 into no-carry, nonzero
 * into carry; GET_CARRY sets its argument to 0 or 1.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

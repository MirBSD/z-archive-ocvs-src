/*
 * Floating point emulator (tailored for SPARC, but structurally
 * machine-independent).
 *
 * Floating point numbers are carried around internally in an `expanded'
 * or `unpacked' form consisting of:
 *	- sign
 *	- unbiased exponent
 *	- mantissa (`1.' + 112-bit fraction + guard + round)
 *	- sticky bit
 * Any implied `1' bit is inserted, giving a 113-bit mantissa that is
 * always nonzero.  Additional low-order `guard' and `round' bits are
 * scrunched in, making the entire mantissa 115 bits long.  This is divided
 * into four 32-bit words, with `spare' bits left over in the upper part
 * of the top word (the high bits of fp_mant[0]).  An internal `exploded'
 * number is thus kept within the half-open interval [1.0,2.0) (but see
 * the `number classes' below).  This holds even for denormalized numbers:
 * when we explode an external denorm, we normalize it, introducing low-order
 * zero bits, so that the rest of the code always sees normalized values.
 *
 * Note that a number of our algorithms use the `spare' bits at the top.
 * The most demanding algorithm---the one for sqrt---depends on two such
 * bits, so that it can represent values up to (but not including) 8.0,
 * and then it needs a carry on top of that, so that we need three `spares'.
 *
 * The sticky-word is 32 bits so that we can use `OR' operators to goosh
 * whole words from the mantissa into it.
 *
 * All operations are done in this internal extended precision.  According
 * to Hennesey & Patterson, Appendix A, rounding can be repeated---that is,
 * it is OK to do a+b in extended precision and then round the result to
 * single precision---provided single, double, and extended precisions are
 * `far enough apart' (they always are), but we will try to avoid any such
 * extra work where possible.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

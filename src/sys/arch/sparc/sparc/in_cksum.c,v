 * the data is in cache, and 1.5-2 times faster if the data is not in
 * cache).
 * We optimize on three fronts:
 *	1. By using the add-with-carry (addxcc) instruction, we can use
 *	   32-bit operations instead of 16-bit operations.
 *	2. By unrolling the main loop to reduce branch overheads.
 *	3. By doing a sequence of load,load,add,add,load,load,add,add,
 *	   we can avoid the extra stall cycle which is incurred if the
 *	   instruction immediately following a load tries to use the
 *	   target register of the load.
 * Another possible optimization is to replace a pair of 32-bit loads
 * with a single 64-bit load (ldd) instruction, but I found that although
 * this improves performance somewhat on Sun4c machines, it actually
 * reduces performance considerably on Sun4m machines (I don't know why).
 * So I chose to leave it out.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

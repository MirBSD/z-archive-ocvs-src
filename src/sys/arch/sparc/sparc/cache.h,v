/*
 * Sun-4 and Sun-4c virtual address cache.
 *
 * Sun-4 virtual caches come in two flavors, write-through (Sun-4c)
 * and write-back (Sun-4).  The write-back caches are much faster
 * but require a bit more care.
 *
 */
enum vactype { VAC_UNKNOWN, VAC_NONE, VAC_WRITETHROUGH, VAC_WRITEBACK };

/*
 * Cache tags can be written in control space, and must be set to 0
 * (or invalid anyway) before turning on the cache.  The tags are
 * addressed as an array of 32-bit structures of the form:
 *
 *	struct cache_tag {
 *		u_int	:7,		(unused; must be zero)
 *			ct_cid:3,	(context ID)
 *			ct_w:1,		(write flag from PTE)
 *			ct_s:1,		(supervisor flag from PTE)
 *			ct_v:1,		(set => cache entry is valid)
 *			:3,		(unused; must be zero)
 *			ct_tid:14,	(cache tag ID)
 *			:2;		(unused; must be zero)
 *	};
 *
 * The SPARCstation 1 cache sees virtual addresses as:
 *
 *	struct cache_va {
 *		u_int	:2,		(unused; probably copies of va_tid<13>)
 *			cva_tid:14,	(tag ID)
 *			cva_line:12,	(cache line number)
 *			cva_byte:4;	(byte in cache line)
 *	};
 *
 * (The SS2 cache is similar but has half as many lines, each twice as long.)
 *
 * Note that, because the 12-bit line ID is `wider' than the page offset,
 * it is possible to have one page map to two different cache lines.
 * This can happen whenever two different physical pages have the same bits
 * in the part of the virtual address that overlaps the cache line ID, i.e.,
 * bits <15:12>.  In order to prevent cache duplication, we have to
 * make sure that no one page has more than one virtual address where
 * (va1 & 0xf000) != (va2 & 0xf000).  (The cache hardware turns off ct_v
 * when a cache miss occurs on a write, i.e., if va1 is in the cache and
 * va2 is not, and you write to va2, va1 goes out of the cache.  If va1
 * is in the cache and va2 is not, reading va2 also causes va1 to become
 * uncached, and the [same] data is then read from main memory into the
 * cache.)
 *
 * The other alternative, of course, is to disable caching of aliased
 * pages.  (In a few cases this might be faster anyway, but we do it
 * only when forced.)
 *
 * The Sun4, since it has an 8K pagesize instead of 4K, needs to check
 * bits that are one position higher.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

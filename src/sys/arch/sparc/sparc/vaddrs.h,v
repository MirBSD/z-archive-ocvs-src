 * Special (fixed) virtual addresses on the SPARC.
 *
 * IO virtual space begins at 0xfe000000 (a segment boundary) and
 * continues up to the DVMA edge at 0xff000000.  (The upper all-1s
 * byte is special since some of the hardware supplies this to pad
 * a 24-bit address space out to 32 bits.  This is a legacy of the
 * IBM PC AT bus, actually, just so you know who to blame.)
 *
 * We reserve several pages at the base of our IO virtual space
 * for `oft-used' devices which must be present anyway in order to
 * configure.  In particular, we want the counter-timer register and
 * the Zilog ZSCC serial port chips to be mapped at fixed VAs to make
 * microtime() and the zs hardware interrupt handlers faster.
 *
 * [sun4/sun4c:]
 * Ideally, we should map the interrupt enable register here as well,
 * but that would require allocating pmegs in locore.s, so instead we
 * use one of the two `wasted' pages at KERNBASE+_MAXNBPG (see locore.s).

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

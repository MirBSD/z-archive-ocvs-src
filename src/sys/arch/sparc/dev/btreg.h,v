 * Several Sun color frame buffers use some kind of Brooktree video
 * DAC (e.g., the Bt458, -- in any case, Brooktree make the only
 * decent color frame buffer chips).
 *
 * Color map control on these is a bit funky in a SPARCstation.
 * To update the color map one would normally do byte writes, but
 * the hardware takes longword writes.  Since there are three
 * registers for each color map entry (R, then G, then B), we have
 * to set color 1 with a write to address 0 (setting 0's R/G/B and
 * color 1's R) followed by a second write to address 1 (setting
 * color 1's G/B and color 2's R/G).  Software must therefore keep
 * a copy of the current map.
 *
 * The colormap address register increments automatically, so the
 * above write is done as:
 *
 *	bt->bt_addr = 0;
 *	bt->bt_cmap = R0G0B0R1;
 *	bt->bt_cmap = G1B1R2G2;
 *	...
 *
 * Yow!
 *
 * Bonus complication: on the cg6, only the top 8 bits of each 32 bit
 * register matter, even though the cg3 takes all the bits from all
 * bytes written to it.

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs

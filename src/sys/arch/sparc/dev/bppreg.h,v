@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

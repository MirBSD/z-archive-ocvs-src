@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the

Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to

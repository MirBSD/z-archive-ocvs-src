@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Improve RELOC value checking logic:
- RELOC values are factured out to sys/arch/sparc/Makefile.reloc
- ksh is used instead of perl
- compile/*/Makefile now checks size on builds

I've taken the comment from the kernel config to check the size;
it says (16384+sizeof bsd)<"RELOC value from boot/bootxx" is ok;
I think this means \${RELOC2} - please correct me if I'm wrong.

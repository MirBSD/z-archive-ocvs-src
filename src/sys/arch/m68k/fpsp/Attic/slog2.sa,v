@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

*	slog2.sa 3.1 12/10/90
*
*       The entry point slog10 computes the base-10 
*	logarithm of an input argument X.
*	slog10d does the same except the input value is a 
*	denormalized number.  
*	sLog2 and sLog2d are the base-2 analogues.
*
*       INPUT:	Double-extended value in memory location pointed to 
*		by address register a0.
*
*       OUTPUT: log_10(X) or log_2(X) returned in floating-point 
*		register fp0.
*
*       ACCURACY and MONOTONICITY: The returned result is within 1.7 
*		ulps in 64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5003 ulp 
*		to 53 bits if the result is subsequently rounded 
*		to double precision. The result is provably monotonic 
*		in double precision.
*
*       SPEED:	Two timings are measured, both in the copy-back mode. 
*		The first one is measured when the function is invoked 
*		the first time (so the instructions and data are not 
*		in cache), and the second one is measured when the 
*		function is reinvoked at the same input argument.
*
*       ALGORITHM and IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
*
*       slog10d:
*
*       Step 0.   If X < 0, create a NaN and raise the invalid operation
*                 flag. Otherwise, save FPCR in D1; set FpCR to default.
*       Notes:    Default means round-to-nearest mode, no floating-point
*                 traps, and precision control = double extended.
*
*       Step 1.   Call slognd to obtain Y = log(X), the natural log of X.
*       Notes:    Even if X is denormalized, log(X) is always normalized.
*
*       Step 2.   Compute log_10(X) = log(X) * (1/log(10)).
*            2.1  Restore the user FPCR
*            2.2  Return ans := Y * INV_L10.
*
*
*       slog10: 
*
*       Step 0.   If X < 0, create a NaN and raise the invalid operation
*                 flag. Otherwise, save FPCR in D1; set FpCR to default.
*       Notes:    Default means round-to-nearest mode, no floating-point
*                 traps, and precision control = double extended.
*
*       Step 1.   Call sLogN to obtain Y = log(X), the natural log of X.
*
*       Step 2.   Compute log_10(X) = log(X) * (1/log(10)).
*            2.1  Restore the user FPCR
*            2.2  Return ans := Y * INV_L10.
*
*
*       sLog2d:
*
*       Step 0.   If X < 0, create a NaN and raise the invalid operation
*                 flag. Otherwise, save FPCR in D1; set FpCR to default.
*       Notes:    Default means round-to-nearest mode, no floating-point
*                 traps, and precision control = double extended.
*
*       Step 1.   Call slognd to obtain Y = log(X), the natural log of X.
*       Notes:    Even if X is denormalized, log(X) is always normalized.
*
*       Step 2.   Compute log_10(X) = log(X) * (1/log(2)).
*            2.1  Restore the user FPCR
*            2.2  Return ans := Y * INV_L2.
*
*
*       sLog2:
*
*       Step 0.   If X < 0, create a NaN and raise the invalid operation
*                 flag. Otherwise, save FPCR in D1; set FpCR to default.
*       Notes:    Default means round-to-nearest mode, no floating-point
*                 traps, and precision control = double extended.
*
*       Step 1.   If X is not an integer power of two, i.e., X != 2^k,
*                 go to Step 3.
*
*       Step 2.   Return k.
*            2.1  Get integer k, X = 2^k.
*            2.2  Restore the user FPCR.
*            2.3  Return ans := convert-to-double-extended(k).
*
*       Step 3.   Call sLogN to obtain Y = log(X), the natural log of X.
*
*       Step 4.   Compute log_2(X) = log(X) * (1/log(2)).
*            4.1  Restore the user FPCR
*            4.2  Return ans := Y * INV_L2.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

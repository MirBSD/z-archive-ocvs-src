@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

*
*	The entry point sINT computes the rounded integer 
*	equivalent of the input argument, sINTRZ computes 
*	the integer rounded to zero of the input argument.
*
*	Entry points sint and sintrz are called from do_func
*	to emulate the fint and fintrz unimplemented instructions,
*	respectively.  Entry point sintdo is used by bindec.
*
*	Input: (Entry points sint and sintrz) Double-extended
*		number X in the ETEMP space in the floating-point
*		save stack.
*	       (Entry point sintdo) Double-extended number X in
*		location pointed to by the address register a0.
*	       (Entry point sintd) Double-extended denormalized
*		number X in the ETEMP space in the floating-point
*		save stack.
*
*	Output: The function returns int(X) or intrz(X) in fp0.
*
*	Modifies: fp0.
*
*	Algorithm: (sint and sintrz)
*
*	1. If exp(X) >= 63, return X. 
*	   If exp(X) < 0, return +/- 0 or +/- 1, according to
*	   the rounding mode.
*	
*	2. (X is in range) set rsc = 63 - exp(X). Unnormalize the
*	   result to the exponent $403e.
*
*	3. Round the result in the mode given in USER_FPCR. For
*	   sintrz, force round-to-zero mode.
*
*	4. Normalize the rounded result; store in fp0.
*
*	For the denormalized cases, force the correct result
*	for the given sign and rounding mode.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

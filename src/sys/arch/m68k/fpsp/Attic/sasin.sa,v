@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

*
*	Description: The entry point sAsin computes the inverse sine of
*		an input argument; sAsind does the same except for denormalized
*		input.
*
*	Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to
*		by address register a0.
*
*	Output: The value arcsin(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*	Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*		64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*		result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The 
*		result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*	Speed: The program sASIN takes approximately 310 cycles.
*
*	Algorithm:
*
*	ASIN
*	1. If |X| >= 1, go to 3.
*
*	2. (|X| < 1) Calculate asin(X) by
*		z := sqrt( [1-X][1+X] )
*		asin(X) = atan( x / z ).
*		Exit.
*
*	3. If |X| > 1, go to 5.
*
*	4. (|X| = 1) sgn := sign(X), return asin(X) := sgn * Pi/2. Exit.
*
*	5. (|X| > 1) Generate an invalid operation by 0 * infinity.
*		Exit.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

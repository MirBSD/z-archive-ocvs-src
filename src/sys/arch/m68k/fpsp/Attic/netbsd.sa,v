@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

*	skeleton.sa 3.2 4/26/91
*
*	This file contains code that is system dependent and will
*	need to be modified to install the FPSP.
*
*	Each entry point for exception 'xxxx' begins with a 'jmp fpsp_xxxx'.
*	Put any target system specific handling that must be done immediately
*	before the jump instruction.  If there no handling necessary, then
*	the 'fpsp_xxxx' handler entry point should be placed in the exception
*	table so that the 'jmp' can be eliminated. If the FPSP determines that the
*	exception is one that must be reported then there will be a
*	return from the package by a 'jmp real_xxxx'.  At that point
*	the machine state will be identical to the state before
*	the FPSP was entered.  In particular, whatever condition
*	that caused the exception will still be pending when the FPSP
*	package returns.  Thus, there will be system specific code
*	to handle the exception.
*
*	If the exception was completely handled by the package, then
*	the return will be via a 'jmp fpsp_done'.  Unless there is 
*	OS specific work to be done (such as handling a context switch or
*	interrupt) the user program can be resumed via 'rte'.
*
*	In the following skeleton code, some typical 'real_xxxx' handling
*	code is shown.  This code may need to be moved to an appropriate
*	place in the target system, or rewritten.
*

*
*	Inexact exception
*
*	All inexact exceptions are real, but the 'real' handler
*	will probably want to clear the pending exception.
*	The provided code will clear the E3 exception (if pending), 
*	otherwise clear the E1 exception.  The frestore is not really
*	necessary for E1 exceptions.
*
* Code following the 'inex' label is to handle bug #1232.  In this
* bug, if an E1 snan, ovfl, or unfl occurred, and the process was
* swapped out before taking the exception, the exception taken on
* return was inex, rather than the correct exception.  The snan, ovfl,
* and unfl exception to be taken must not have been enabled.  The
* fix is to check for E1, and the existence of one of snan, ovfl,
* or unfl bits set in the fpsr.  If any of these are set, branch
* to the appropriate  handler for the exception in the fpsr.  Note
* that this fix is only for d43b parts, and is skipped if the
* version number is not $40.

*	mem_write --- write to user or supervisor address space
*
* Writes to memory while in supervisor mode.  copyout accomplishes
* this via a 'moves' instruction.  copyout is a UNIX SVR3 (and later) function.
* If you don't have copyout, use the local copy of the function below.
*
*	a0 - supervisor source address
*	a1 - user destination address
*	d0 - number of bytes to write (maximum count is 12)
*
* The supervisor source address is guaranteed to point into the supervisor
* stack.  The result is that a UNIX
* process is allowed to sleep as a consequence of a page fault during
* copyout.  The probability of a page fault is exceedingly small because
* the 68040 always reads the destination address and thus the page
* faults should have already been handled.
*
* If the EXC_SR shows that the exception was from supervisor space,
* then just do a dumb (and slow) memory move.  In a UNIX environment
* there shouldn't be any supervisor mode floating point exceptions.
*

*
*	mem_read --- read from user or supervisor address space
*
* Reads from memory while in supervisor mode.  copyin accomplishes
* this via a 'moves' instruction.  copyin is a UNIX SVR3 (and later) function.
* If you don't have copyin, use the local copy of the function below.
*
* The FPSP calls mem_read to read the original F-line instruction in order
* to extract the data register number when the 'Dn' addressing mode is
* used.
*
*Input:
*	a0 - user source address
*	a1 - supervisor destination address
*	d0 - number of bytes to read (maximum count is 12)
*
* Like mem_write, mem_read always reads with a supervisor 
* destination address on the supervisor stack.  Also like mem_write,
* the EXC_SR is checked and a simple memory copy is done if reading
* from supervisor space is indicated.

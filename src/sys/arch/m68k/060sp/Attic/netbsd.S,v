@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

# Each IO routine checks to see if the memory write/read is to/from user
# or supervisor application space. The examples below use simple "move"
# instructions for supervisor mode applications and call _copyin()/_copyout()
# for user mode applications.
# When installing the 060SP, the _copyin()/_copyout() equivalents for a 
# given operating system should be substituted.
#
# The addresses within the 060SP are guaranteed to be on the stack.
# The result is that Unix processes are allowed to sleep as a consequence
# of a page fault during a _copyout.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

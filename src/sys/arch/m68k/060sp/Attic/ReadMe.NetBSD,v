@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

Notes about the NetBSD integration
----------------------------------

Preface and Acknowledgements: 

A first try at integrating the M68060 Software Package was done by
Yasushi Yamasaki of the NetBSD/x68k group, but only available as a
patch file to their source tree (which wasn't integrated into the
NetBSD master tree at that time).

I started with their glue code version from the patch file, and
changed the following things up to now:

- collapse a few identical glue routines (fetch code/data words/longs
from user space) into a multi-labeled one

- make the gas syntax files of the glue code the Master files

- I call the access error handler (label _buserr) directly, instead of
through an RTE as in the example file

Other changes are only in the method this was integrated into the
Amiga vs. X68k port, which is machine dependend anyway.

Thanks for the initial effort!



I. File suffix convention

I cvs imported all of the Motorola files (with lowercase names).

These are:

*.s:	Assembler files "unsupported by Motorola, provided as a reference only"
*.sa:	Pseudo assembler hex dump files, which is Motorolas supported version.
*.doc:	docs by Motorola

errata, changes, files, readme: by Motorola.


I choose .S as the file suffix which is feeded to our assembler
directly or indirectly.

We use:		To create: 

isp.sa		isp.S
fpsp.sa		fpsp.S

In addition, inetbsd.S and fnetbsd.S are our part specific glue files,
netbsd.S is our general glue file, and copyright.S ensures we have a
copy of the copyright notice in the kernel if using the 060SP.

To enforce the right relative positions of isp/its glue code inetbsd.S
includes isp.S at the end, and fnetbsd.S includes fpsp.S.

Ia: Don't Change Files

- all Motorola doc files, all .sa (hex) files.

Ib: Nearly Don't Change Files

- for now, the .s files by Motorola. We might use the fpsp.s file
later to create an optimized version, once we a) verified its
identical to the supported .s and b) write a conversion (to .S format)
script.

II. Interface to the arch/$machine/$machine files:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.2
log
@* first futile attempt to merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* damn! they got pxeboot! -> disable for now
  (there's still ports/sysutils/pxegrub; we'll have pxeboot later)
* I don't know if that ... bootloader still works
* nuke netbsd emul (was unused anyways)
* nuke a plethora of syscalls not being used, and mark
  the other two (COMPAT_35) for deletion RSN
* merge new MI-GENERIC into i386 GENERIC
* resolve numeric conflicts for
  - syscalls
  - sysctls
  - device majors
  - pcidevs
* (c) cleanup - no need to add a bsd-like licence when
  there's already one; just add my name
* and much more

1.1.1.1
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

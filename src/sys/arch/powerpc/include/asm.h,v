@Another round of mega-commit-death:
* compile fixes (pre-removal)
* distrib list sync (pre-removal)
* throw out more orphaned profiling stuff
* sync with reality (post-removal)
  -> e.g. don't call comsatd in inetd.conf
* general clean-up phase for touched files,
  or stuff "while here"
* partial distrib list sync (post-removal)
* replace echo with print in /etc/profile

kernel builds; will do a make b-r in two jiffies

@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

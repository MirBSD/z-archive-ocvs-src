@Remove "some dead architectures".

These are all but i386 and x86-64 (which is not in the tree yet),
because I have no machines to work with.

Re-adding support should be fairly easy, just cvs adding a partial
OpenBSD checkout and pulling in stuff like kernel signal patch, humantime,
etc. which got added to i386 as well.

You will need gcc support as well.

.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install a bootstrap on an FFS disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl v
.Ar bootsd
.Ar bootxx
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
is used to install a "first-stage" boot program into the boot area
of an FFS disk partition, and initialize the table of block numbers the
.Ar bootxx
program uses to load the second-stage boot program.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, printing out the block numbers that
.Ar bootxx
will use to load
.Ar bootsd .
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width bootsd
.It Ar bootsd
the name of the second-stage boot program in the file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar bootxx
the name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program.
.It Ar rawdev
the name of the raw device in which the first-stage boot program
is to be installed.  This should correspond to the block device
on which the file system containing
.Ar bootsd
is mounted.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal
cp /usr/mdec/bootsd /
/usr/mdec/installboot /bootsd /usr/mdec/bootxx /dev/rsd0a
.Sh BUGS
.Nm installboot
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the raw device, but that is not allowed with the kernel
.Nm securelevel
variable set to a value greater than zero (the default), so
.Nm installboot
only works in single-user mode (or insecure mode - see
.Xr init 8 ).

.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr init 8

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

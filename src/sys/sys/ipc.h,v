@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

Change mode_t and nlink_t from 16bit to 32bit.

	millert@@cvs.openbsd.org 2004/07/14 12:00:48
fhstat(2) uses struct stat too and so needs replacing as well.

	millert@@cvs.openbsd.org 2004/07/14 17:45:11
Because mode_t is used in struct ipc_perm we need new versions of
the msgctl, semctl, and shmctl system calls.  This moves the old
versions to COMPAT_35 and adds new ones.

	millert@@cvs.openbsd.org 2004/07/15 05:24:46
Rename structs oipc_perm, omsqid_ds, osemid_ds, oshmid_ds to ipc_perm23,
etc to avoid confusion and for consistency with the *35 ones.
Remove *n2o functions that don't belong outside of compat.

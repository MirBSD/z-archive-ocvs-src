@Pull in ISDN support from NetBSD, push out the old
one with the "I require you to send me a postcard"
licence.

This enables building a kernel with ISDN support
(it's just slower and like 200 KiB bigger), but
disables isdnd from userland and needs different
manpages and other fixes from NetBSD.

Also added:
 - support for the callout API from NetBSD, which
   is in fact our stolen new-style timeout API,
   just with a bit more overhead and different names
   for the structure
 - some includes sync with NBSD
 - a shitload of kludges to make ISDN build

This needs security, style and bloat audits fast.
And testing.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

/*
 * Some comments about the values in the scan_io struct:
 *
 * All user-changeable values have minimum and maximum values for
 * specific scanner types and are rejected by the special drivers if
 * they are not in range. For values in the range, the driver selects
 * the next physically possible setting for the particular scanner.
 * So it is good practice to issue a SCIOCGET after a SCIOCSET to see
 * what the driver has chosen.
 *
 * Brightness and contrast default to 100 (%) but scanners may support
 * higher and/or lower values, though the maximum value is 255.
 * velocity is the scan speed and defaults to 100 (%), only slower
 * values may be possible.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

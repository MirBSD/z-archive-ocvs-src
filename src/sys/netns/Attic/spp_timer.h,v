 * The SPPT_REXMT timer is used to force retransmissions.
 * The SPP has the SPPT_REXMT timer set whenever segments
 * have been sent for which ACKs are expected but not yet
 * received.  If an ACK is received which advances tp->snd_una,
 * then the retransmit timer is cleared (if there are no more
 * outstanding segments) or reset to the base value (if there
 * are more ACKs expected).  Whenever the retransmit timer goes off,
 * we retransmit one unacknowledged segment, and do a backoff
 * on the retransmit timer.
 *
 * The SPPT_PERSIST timer is used to keep window size information
 * flowing even if the window goes shut.  If all previous transmissions
 * have been acknowledged (so that there are no retransmissions in progress),
 * and the window is too small to bother sending anything, then we start
 * the SPPT_PERSIST timer.  When it expires, if the window is nonzero,
 * we go to transmit state.  Otherwise, at intervals send a single byte
 * into the peer's window to force him to update our window information.
 * We do this at most as often as SPPT_PERSMIN time intervals,
 * but no more frequently than the current estimate of round-trip
 * packet time.  The SPPT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever we receive
 * a window update from the peer.
 *
 * The SPPT_KEEP timer is used to keep connections alive.  If an
 * connection is idle (no segments received) for SPPTV_KEEP amount of time,
 * but not yet established, then we drop the connection.  If the connection
 * is established, then we force the peer to send us a segment by sending:
 *	<SEQ=SND.UNA-1><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>
 * This segment is (deliberately) outside the window, and should elicit
 * an ack segment in response from the peer.  If, despite the SPPT_KEEP
 * initiated segments we cannot elicit a response from a peer in SPPT_MAXIDLE
 * amount of time, then we drop the connection.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

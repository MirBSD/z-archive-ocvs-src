1.1
log
@Pull in ISDN support from NetBSD, push out the old
one with the "I require you to send me a postcard"
licence.

This enables building a kernel with ISDN support
(it's just slower and like 200 KiB bigger), but
disables isdnd from userland and needs different
manpages and other fixes from NetBSD.

Also added:
 - support for the callout API from NetBSD, which
   is in fact our stolen new-style timeout API,
   just with a bit more overhead and different names
   for the structure
 - some includes sync with NBSD
 - a shitload of kludges to make ISDN build

This needs security, style and bloat audits fast.
And testing.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm login_passwd
.Nd provide standard password authentication type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_passwd
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Ar wheel=yes|no
.Op Fl v Ar lastchance=yes|no
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is called by
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr su 1 ,
.Xr ftpd 8 ,
and others to authenticate the
.Ar user
with passwd-style authentication.
.Pp
The
.Ar user
argument is the login name of the user to be authenticated.
.Pp
The
.Ar service
argument specifies which protocol to use with the
invoking program.
The allowed protocols are
.Em login ,
.Em challenge ,
and
.Em response .
(The
.Em challenge
protocol is silently ignored but will report success as passwd-style
authentication is not challenge-response based).
.Pp
If the
.Ar wheel
argument is specified and is not set to
.Dq yes ,
then the user will be rejected as not being in group
.Dq wheel .
This is used by
.Xr su 1 .
.Pp
If the
.Ar lastchance
argument is specified and is equal to
.Dq yes ,
then if the user's password has expired, and it has not been
expired longer than
.Dq password-dead
seconds (see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) ,
the user will be able to log in one last time to change the password.
.Pp
.Nm
will prompt the user for a password and report back to the
invoking program whether or not the authentication was
successful.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Dt TCPDMATCH 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
tcpdmatch \- tcp wrapper oracle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tcpdmatch
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i Ar inet_conf
.Ar daemon
.Ar client
.Pp
.Nm tcpdmatch
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i Ar inet_conf
.Ar daemon Op Ar @@server
.Op Ar user@@
.Ar client
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
predicts how the tcp wrapper would handle a specific request for service.
Examples are given below.
.Pp
The program examines the
.Xr tcpd 8
access control tables (default
.Pa /etc/hosts.allow
and
.Pa /etc/hosts.deny )
and prints its conclusion.
For maximal accuracy, it extracts additional information from your
.Xr inetd 8
network configuration file.
.Pp
When
.Nm
finds a match in the access control tables, it identifies the matched rule.
In addition, it displays the optional
shell commands or options in a pretty-printed format; this makes it
easier for you to spot any discrepancies between what you want and what
the program understands.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Examine
.Pa hosts.allow
and
.Pa hosts.deny
files in the current directory instead of the default ones.
.It Fl i Ar inet_conf
Specify this option when
.Nm
is unable to find your
.Pa inetd.conf
network configuration file, or when you wish to test with a non-default one.
.El
.Pp
The following two arguments are always required:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Ar daemon
A daemon process name.
Typically, the last component of a daemon executable pathname.
.It Ar client
A host name or network address, or one of the
.Dq unknown
or
.Dq paranoid
wildcard patterns.
.El
.Pp
When a client host name is specified,
.Nm
gives a prediction for each address listed for that client.
.Pp
When a client address is specified,
.Nm
predicts what
.Xr tcpd 8
would do when client name lookup fails.
.Pp
Optional information specified with the
.Ar daemon@@server
form:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Ar server
A host name or network address, or one of the
.Dq unknown
or
.Dq paranoid
wildcard patterns.
The default server name is
.Dq unknown .
.El
.Pp
Optional information specified with the
.Ar user@@client
form:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Ar user
A client user identifier.
Typically, a login name or a numeric user ID.
The default user name is
.Dq unknown .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To predict how
.Xr tcpd 8
would handle a telnet request from the local system:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
$ tcpdmatch telnetd localhost
.Ed
.Pp
The same request, pretending that hostname lookup failed:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
$ tcpdmatch telnetd 127.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
To predict what
.Xr tcpd 8
would do when the client name does not match the client address:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
$ tcpdmatch telnetd paranoid
.Ed
.\" .Pp
.\" On some systems, daemon names have no `in.' prefix, or
.\" .Nm tcpdmatch\
.\" may need some help to locate the inetd configuration file.
.Sh FILES
The default locations of the
.Xr tcpd 8
access control tables are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width /etc/hosts.allow -compact
.It Pa /etc/hosts.allow
access control table (allow list)
.It Pa /etc/hosts.deny
access control table (deny list)
.El

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

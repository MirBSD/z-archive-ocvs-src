@nuke 4.4BSD LFS tools - that would be nice to have, but noone ports it from netbsd, and it can't handle more than 80% full filesystems anyways

.Sh NAME
.Nm lfs_cleanerd
.Nd garbage collect a log-structured file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lfs_cleanerd
.Op Fl ds
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm lfs_cleanerd
command starts a daemon process which garbage-collects
the log-structured file system residing at the point named by
.Ar node
in the global file system namespace.
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount_lfs 8
when the log-structured file system is mounted.
The daemon will exit within a few minutes
of when the file system it was cleaning is unmounted.
.Pp
Garbage collection on a log-structured file system is done by scanning
the file system's segments for active, i.e., referenced, data and copying
it to new segments.
When all of the active data in a given segment has been copied to a new
segment that segment can be marked as empty, thus reclaiming the space
taken by the inactive data which was in it.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode.
Do not become a daemon process, and print debugging information.
.It Fl s
When cleaning the file system, read data in small chunks.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount_lfs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm lfs_cleanerd
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm comsat
.Nd biff server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm comsat
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the server process which receives reports of incoming mail
and notifies users if they have requested this service.
.Nm
receives messages on a datagram port associated with the
.Dq biff
service
specification (see
.Xr services 5
and
.Xr inetd 8 ) .
The one line messages are of the form:
.Pp
.Dl user@@mailbox-offset
.Pp
If the
.Em user
specified is logged in to the system and the associated terminal has
the owner execute bit turned on (by a
.Dq Li biff y ) ,
the
.Em offset
is used as a seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file and
the first 7 lines or 560 characters of the message are printed
on the user's terminal.
Lines which appear to be part of the message header other than the
.Dq From ,
.Dq \&To ,
.Dq Date ,
or
.Dq Subject
lines are not included in the displayed message.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/utmp -compact
.It Pa /var/run/utmp
to find out who's logged on and on what terminals
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr biff 1 ,
.Xr inetd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The message header filtering is prone to error.
The density of the information presented is near the theoretical minimum.
.Pp
Users should be notified of mail which arrives on other
machines than the one to which they are currently logged in.
.Pp
The notification should appear in a separate window so it
does not mess up the screen.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

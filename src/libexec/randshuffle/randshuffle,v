@* after reading /sys/dev/rnd.c, I've come to the conclusion I can
  safely optimize this (add error handling et al. while here; can
  somebody double-check my ksh [i.e. do temp files get deleted or
  other stuff like that?] and stuff?)
* damnit @@ Makefile, I thought I had long fixed it again, 3 times

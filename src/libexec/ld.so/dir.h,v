log
@re-add a "not so important" directory that just went away
without telling me so.
It did even vanish from the CVS repository. I think, CVS
is buggy.

log
@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed
stable enough.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

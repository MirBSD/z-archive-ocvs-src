.Nd remote user information server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fingerd
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl M
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl S
.Op Fl P Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple protocol based on
.%T RFC1288
that provides an interface to the
Name and Finger programs at several network sites.
The program is supposed to return a friendly,
human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment
or a particular person in depth.
There is no required format and the
protocol consists mostly of specifying a single
.Dq command line .
.Pp
.Nm
is started by
.Xr inetd 8 ,
which listens for
.Tn TCP
requests at port 79.
Once connected it reads a single command line
terminated by a
.Aq Tn CRLF
which is passed to
.Xr finger 1 .
.Nm
closes its connections as soon as the output is finished.
.Pp
If the line is null (i.e., just a
.Aq Tn CRLF
is sent) then
.Xr finger 1
returns a
.Dq default
report that lists all people logged into
the system at that moment.
.Pp
If a user name is specified (e.g.,
.Pf eric Aq Tn CRLF )
then the
response lists more extended information for only that particular user,
whether logged in or not.
Allowable
.Dq names
in the command line include both
.Dq login names
and
.Dq user names .
If a name is ambiguous, all possible derivations are returned.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to
.Nm
as server program arguments in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Enable secure mode.
Forwarding of queries to other remote hosts is denied.
.It Fl l
Enable logging.
The name of the host originating the query is reported via
.Xr syslog 3
at LOG_NOTICE priority.
.It Fl u
Queries without a user name are rejected.
.It Fl m
Prevent matching of
.Ar user
names.
.Ar User
is usually a login name; however, matching will also be done on the
users' real names, unless the
.Fl m
option is supplied.
.It Fl M
Enables matching of
.Ar user
names.
This is disabled by default if the system is running YP.
.It Fl p
Prevents
.Nm
from displaying the contents of the
.Dq Pa .plan
and
.Dq Pa .project
files.
.It Fl S
Prints user information in short mode, one line per user.
This overrides the
.Dq Pa Whois switch
that may be passed in from the remote client.
.It Fl P Ar filename
Use an alternate program as the local information provider.
The default local program
executed by
.Nm
is
.Xr finger 1 .
By specifying a customized local server,
this option allows a system manager
to have more control over what information is
provided to remote sites.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr finger 1 ,
.Xr inetd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
Connecting directly to the server from a
.Tn TIP
or an equally narrow-minded
.Tn TELNET Ns \-protocol
user program can result
in meaningless attempts at option negotiation being sent to the
server, which will foul up the command line interpretation.
.Nm
should be taught to filter out
.Tn IAC Ns \'s
and perhaps even respond
negatively
.Pq Tn IAC WON'T
to all option commands received.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Dt GETTY 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getty
.Nd set terminal mode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm getty
.Oo
.Ar type
.Op Ar tty
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program
is called by
.Xr init 8
to open and initialize the tty line, read a login name, and invoke
.Xr login 1 .
.Pp
The argument
.Ar tty
is the special device file in
.Pa /dev
to open for the terminal (for example, ``ttyh0'').
If there is no argument or the argument is
.Ql Fl ,
the tty line is assumed to be open as file descriptor 0.
.Pp
The
.Ar type
argument can be used to make
.Nm
treat the terminal line specially.
This argument is used as an index into the
.Xr gettytab 5
database, to determine the characteristics of the line.
If there is no argument, or there is no such table, the
.Em default
table is used.
If there is no
.Pa /etc/gettytab
a set of system defaults is used.
If indicated by the table located,
.Nm
will clear the terminal screen,
print a banner heading,
and prompt for a login name.
Usually either the banner or the login prompt will include
the system hostname.
.Pp
Most of the default actions of
.Nm
can be circumvented, or modified, by a suitable
.Xr gettytab 5
table.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program
can be set to timeout after some interval,
which will cause dial up lines to hang up
if the login name is not entered reasonably quickly.
.Sh RESOURCES
.Nm
is started by
.Xr init 8 ,
with a process priority, umask, and resource limits based on the
.Dq default
entry in
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ttyxx: No such device or address."
.It "ttyxx: No such file or address."
A terminal which is turned
on in the
.Xr ttys 5
file cannot be opened, likely because the requisite
lines are either not configured into the system, the associated device
was not attached during boot-time system configuration,
or the special file in
.Pa /dev
does not exist.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Synchronize source tree with OpenBSD
note: due to recent changes in the codebase of OpenBSD,
out libcom_err will be incompatible with theirs...
but this is no issue because we don't provide a dynamically
linked one, and theirs won't be provided longer any more anyways.

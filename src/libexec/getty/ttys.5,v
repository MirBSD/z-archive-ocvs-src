.Sh NAME
.Nm ttys
.Nd terminal initialization information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains information that is used by various routines to initialize
and control the use of terminal special files.
This information is read with the
.Xr getttyent 3
library routines.
There is one line in the
.Nm
file per special device file.
Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.
Fields comprised of more than one word should be enclosed in double quotes
.Pq Ql \&" .
Blank lines and comments may appear anywhere in the file; comments
are delimited by hash marks
.Pq Ql #
and newlines.
Any unspecified fields will default to null.
.Pp
The first field is the
name of the terminal special file as it is found in
.Pa /dev .
.Pp
The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line,
usually
.Xr getty 8 ,
which initializes and opens the line, setting the speed, waiting for
a user name and executing the
.Xr login 1
program.
It can be, however, any desired command, for example
the start up for a window system terminal emulator or some other
daemon process, and can contain multiple words if quoted.
.Pp
The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that
TTY line, normally the one found in the
.Xr termcap 5
database file.
The environment variable
.Dv TERM
is initialized with the value by either
.Xr getty 8
or
.Xr login 1 .
.Pp
The remaining fields set flags in the
.Fa ty_status
entry (see
.Xr getttyent 3 )
or specify a window system process that
.Xr init 8
will maintain for the terminal line.
The following is a list of permitted flags for each TTY:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx
.It Ar on
Specify that
.Xr init 8
should execute the command given in the second field.
.It Ar off
The opposite of on.
.It Ar secure
If
.Ar on
is also specified, allows users with a UID of 0 to login on this line.
.El
.Pp
Additionally, the following flags modify the default behavior of
the terminal line.
Some of these flags may not be supported by a terminal line driver.
The flag fields should not be quoted.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx
.It Ar local
Treat the line as if it is locally connected.
.It Ar rtscts
Use RTS/CTS hardware flow control, if
possible.
.It Ar mdmbuf
Use DTR/DCD flow control if possible.
.It Ar softcar
Ignore hardware carrier on the line.
.El
.Pp
The string
.Ar window=
may be followed by a quoted command string which
.Xr init 8
will execute
.Em before
starting the command specified by the second field.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

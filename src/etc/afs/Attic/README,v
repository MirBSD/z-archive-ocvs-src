@Please enter an AFS cell near you in the ThisCell file.

The SuidCells file specifies cells, other than your home cell, for which
the AFS client will actually honor the setuid bit.

If you have an "unknown" cell that is not known in the CellServDB, make
sure to update your cell.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to

@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@First (probably not working[1]) attempt at modernizing the framework:
* MANZ, MANPS, NOPROFILE die (always set to false, false, true)
* Fortran generating code for <bsd.prog.mk> dies (pascal to follow)
* GLOBAL_AUTOCONF_CACHE dies (birth of <bsd.gnuwrap.mk> to follow...)
* sanitize my head and rewrite certain pieces of certain Makefiles
* move most mk.conf functionality out of there, so a system
  without mk.conf works really well(TM)
* attempt at synching docs with reality

[1] First update *.mk, then remove old mk.conf and mk.conf.local,
    then install new mk.conf and adapt it to suit your needs.

Why don't the OpenBSD people modernize parts of this? The indenting
is really really bad in places, and MANSUBDIR was... well. I have
done it with 1/3 of the code now, and it works. Even better.

There will definitively follow more ;-)

log
@o auto-detect rwd*c drives to disable HDD hardware write cache
  from the entries in /etc/fstab; report progress and potential
  failure (from Denis A. Doroshenko <d.doroshenko@@omnitel.net>)
o allow for additional drives (such as non-softdep filesystems'
  drives or "the device behind /dev/root") to be mentioned for
  disabling the HDD write cache; don't invoke sort(1) and uniq(1)
  but rather do the work in shell (should be faster especially
  on machines with very slow I/O)
o convert all [ x"$foo" = x"bar" -a \! false ] to the korn shell
  syntax of [[ $foo == bar && ! false ]] for security reasons
  NOTE: this now means /etc/rc and friends are to be read by ksh!
o remove whitespace after the '<', '>', '>>' of file redirections
o remove whitespace before a ;
o fix whitespace and tab settings; cosmetics
o replace 'FOO=bar; export FOO' with 'export FOO=bar'
o nuke unused string escapes like 'food ${food_params}'
o protect string escapes like '/dev/r$bar.blah' -> '/dev/r${bar}.blah'

I haven't still read the entire ksh manual and O'Reilly book,
but will continue to do so and encourage everybody to polish
his korn shell speak for autumn ;-)

1.2.2.1
log
@verified exec ported from NetBSD 1.6.1 / Stephanie patches for OpenBSD 3.4:
 - prevent execution of trojaned applications (f.e. netstat,ps,..)
 - activated in GENERIC, but must be enabled with sysctl -w kern.vexec.op=1
 - you have to generate the fingerprint database with fpgen.sh from sbin/vexecctl/

TODO:
- fix a problem with hardlinked applications (f.e. /bin/chown and /bin/chgrp)
  error: "vexec_inodeadd: Received invalid fingerprint for an existing entry! Entry not modified."
- patch MAKEDEV.mi to create devicenode /dev/vexec
- create sample database when doing make release (/etc/vexec.conf.release)
- more testing, test it on sparc
- do performance tests

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

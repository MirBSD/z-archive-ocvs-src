Notes about the KerberosV support in OpenBSD:

- This is currently experimental code.

- OpenBSD contains the Heimdal implementation of KerberosV from KTH in Sweden.

- Please check the heimdal info page (type "info heimdal") to get more
  information. A number of manpages exist, mainly describing the krb5 API.

- There are some very informational RFCs in the source directory.

- Before you use KerberosV you should setup an /etc/kerberosV/krb5.conf
  according to the instructions in the heimdal infopage.

- The directory /var/heimdal contains logs, the database and acl files,
  and must be created before the kdc, kadmind or kpasswdd can be used.
  Disclosing the database would be a _really_ bad thing.

- The file /etc/kerberosV/krb5.keytab contains the encryption keys and
  its important that you keep this file secret.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to

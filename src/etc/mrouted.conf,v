@#	$OpenBSD: mrouted.conf,v 1.7 2003/02/26 23:15:20 millert Exp $
#
#   This is the configuration file for "mrouted", an IP multicast router.
#   mrouted looks for it in "/etc/mrouted.conf".
#
#   Command formats:
#
# name <boundname> <scoped-addr>/<mask-len>
# cache_lifetime 3600		# seconds
# pruning on
#
# phyint <local-addr> [disable] [metric <m>] [threshold <t>] [rate_limit <b>]
#        [boundary (<boundname>|<scoped-addr>/<mask-len>)]
#	 [altnet (<subnet>/<mask-len>|<subnet>)]
# tunnel <local-addr> <remote-addr> [srcrt] [metric <m>]
#        [threshold <t>] [rate_limit <b>]
#        [boundary (<boundname>|<scoped-addr>/<mask-len>)]
#
#   NOTE: any phyint commands MUST precede any tunnel commands
#   NOTE: the mask-len is the no. of leading 1's in the mask
#   NOTE: rate_limit is in kilobits, and defaults to 500 for tunnels
#
# Example of named boundary:
#name LOCAL 239.255.0.0/16
#name EE 239.254.0.0/16		# i.e. the EE dept wants local groups
#
# Example of use of named boundary
#phyint le1 boundary EE		# le1 is our interface to comp sci,
#				# keep them away from our local groups
#
#
# Template tunnel for mcast_install
#tunnel 128.4.0.77 128.4.0.8 metric 1 threshold 64 rate_limit 500  # <-- REPLACE
#	boundary LOCAL
#
# You might want to specify a boundary on your tunnel to the outside world,
# as above.
#
# NOTE: ONLY uncomment the following if you are running mrouted.snmp!
#sysName	"mymrouter"
#sysContact	"Me <me@@me.com> +x.yyy.zzz-zzzz"
#sysVersion	"MyOS 4.1.3 and mrouted"

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

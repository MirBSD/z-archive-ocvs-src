@o auto-detect rwd*c drives to disable HDD hardware write cache
  from the entries in /etc/fstab; report progress and potential
  failure (from Denis A. Doroshenko <d.doroshenko@@omnitel.net>)
o allow for additional drives (such as non-softdep filesystems'
  drives or "the device behind /dev/root") to be mentioned for
  disabling the HDD write cache; don't invoke sort(1) and uniq(1)
  but rather do the work in shell (should be faster especially
  on machines with very slow I/O)
o convert all [ x"$foo" = x"bar" -a \! false ] to the korn shell
  syntax of [[ $foo == bar && ! false ]] for security reasons
  NOTE: this now means /etc/rc and friends are to be read by ksh!
o remove whitespace after the '<', '>', '>>' of file redirections
o remove whitespace before a ;
o fix whitespace and tab settings; cosmetics
o replace 'FOO=bar; export FOO' with 'export FOO=bar'
o nuke unused string escapes like 'food ${food_params}'
o protect string escapes like '/dev/r$bar.blah' -> '/dev/r${bar}.blah'

I haven't still read the entire ksh manual and O'Reilly book,
but will continue to do so and encourage everybody to polish
his korn shell speak for autumn ;-)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

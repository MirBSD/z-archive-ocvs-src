#          Example of ppp.linkdown file
#
#  This file is checked when ppp closes a connection.
#  ppp searches the labels in this file as follows:
#
#  1) The label that matches the IP number assigned to our side.
#
#  2) The label specified on the command line to ppp.
#
#  3) If no label has been found, use MYADDR if it exists.

# We don't really need to do much here.  If we have notified a DNS
# of our temporary IP number, we may want to ``un-notify'' them.
#
# If you're into sound effects when the link goes down, you can run
# ``auplay'' (assuming NAS is installed and configured).

# If you're running ``ppp -auto -alias dynamic-alias-auto'', and are
# assigned a dynamic IP number by the peer, this may be worth while
# to keep the interface aliases to a minimum (see ``enable iface-alias''

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

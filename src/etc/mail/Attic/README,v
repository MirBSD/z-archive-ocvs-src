@$OpenBSD: README,v 1.1 2003/09/23 21:37:11 millert Exp $

This directory contains the configuration files for sendmail(8).
The source for the .cf files lives in /usr/share/sendmail/cf.
You should make changes in the corresponding .mc file and not edit
the .cf files directly.  Useful information may be found in
/usr/share/sendmail/README, /usr/share/sendmail/TUNING, and
/usr/share/doc/smm/08.sendmailop/op.me.

Sendmail configuration files:
    submit.cf		Built from /usr/share/sendmail/cf/submit.mc.
			Used when sendmail is invoked directly from
			the command line to send mail (for instance,
			when called by mail(1)).

    localhost.cf	Built from /usr/share/sendmail/cf/openbsd-localhost.mc.
			Only allows connections from the local host, not
			the network at large.  This is the default
			configuration file used on OpenBSD.  See afterboot(8)
			for more information.

    sendmail.cf		Built from /usr/share/sendmail/cf/openbsd-proto.mc.
			A more full-featured configuration file that
			allows SMTP connections from the internet.


Other files used by sendmail(8) in this directory include:

    access		Access database (blacklist, whitelist, etc).

    aliases		System aliases database.

    helpfile		Help file for sendmail(8).

    local-host-names	List of other hostnames to treat as local.
			You do not need to list the system hostname,
			the name(s) associated with any active network
			interface or a CNAME that points to one of
			those names.  This file is read only at startup
			or when sendmail(8) is sent SIGHUP.

    mailertable		Used to override routing for particular (non-local)
			domains.

    relay-domains	List of other domains to relay mail for.
			By default, sendmail(8) will not relay for
			foriegn domains--if the mail is not destined
			for (or sent by) a user in the local domain it
			will be rejected.  This file is read only at
			startup or when sendmail(8) is sent SIGHUP.

    virtusertable	Virtual user table; maps incoming mail addresses
			to alternate local usernames or aliases.

Note that by default, only sendmail.cf will use the access, local-host-names,
mailertable, relay-domains, userdb, and virtusertable files.
These files are not used by the default localhost.cf or submit.cf
since they are generally not needed for localhost-only configs.

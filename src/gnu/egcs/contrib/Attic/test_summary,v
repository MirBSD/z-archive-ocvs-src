# This script is Free Software, and it can be copied, distributed and
# modified as defined in the GNU General Public License.  A copy of
# its license can be downloaded from http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

# This script processes *.{sum,log} files, producing a shell-script
# that sends e-mail to the appropriate lists and renames files to
# *.sent.  It currently handles only gcc, but it should be quite easy
# to modify it to handle other packages and its mailing lists.

# The scripts assumes it is run in the root directory of the build
# tree, and it will include all .sum files it finds in the mail
# report.

# configure flags are extracted from ./config.status

# if the BOOT_CFLAGS environment variable is set, it will be included
# in the mail report too.

# The usage pattern of this script is as follows:

# test_summary | more   # so as to observe what should be done

# test_summary | sh     # so as to actually send e-mail and move log files

# It accepts a few command line arguments.  For example:
# -o: re-reads logs that have been mailed already (.sum.sent)
# -t: prevents logs from being renamed
# -p: prepend specified file (or list of files: -p "a b") to the report
# -i: append specified file (or list of files: -i "a b") to the report
# -m: specify the e-mail address to send notes to.  An appropriate default
#     should be selected from the log files.
# -f: force reports to be mailed; if omitted, only reports that differ
#     from the sent.* version are sent.

# Find a good awk.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

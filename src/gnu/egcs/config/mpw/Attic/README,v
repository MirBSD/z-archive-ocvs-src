@Now that most stuff is updated and/or deprecated, it's amazing with how few other infrastructure you can build fallback-gcc

@This directory contains MPW scripts and related files that are needed to
build Cygnus GNU tools for MPW.  The scripts should be somewhere on the
command path; our usual practice has been to have a separate directory
for the scripts, and put the tools (byacc, flex, and sed at least) there
also; then it's easier to drag the support bits around as a group, or to
upgrade MPW versions.  The complete package of scripts and tool binaries
is usually available as pub/mac/buildtools.cpt.hqx on ftp.cygnus.com.

"tr-7to8-src" is actually the source to an MPW script that transforms
sequences like "\Option-d" into the actual 8-bit chars that MPW needs.
It's only the source because it can't itself include any 8-bit chars.
It *can* be processed into a genuine "tr-7to8" by using itself:

	tr-7to8 tr-7to8-src | sed -e 's/Src//' >new-tr-7to8

Use this to verify:

	compare tr-7to8 new-tr-7to8

If you don't have a working tr-7to8, then you will have to manually
replace all occurrences of "\Option-d" with real Option-d (which looks
like a delta), then do similarly with all the other "\Option-..."
strings, and then change "\SrcOption-d" into the string "\Option-d".

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

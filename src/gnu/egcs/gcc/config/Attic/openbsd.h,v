@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

   a repository for common defines. 

   Some defines are common to all architectures, a few of them are
   triggered by OBSD_* guards, so that we won't override architecture
   defaults by mistakes.

   OBSD_HAS_CORRECT_SPECS: 
      another mechanism provides correct specs already.
   OBSD_NO_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES: 
      no implementation of dynamic libraries.
   OBSD_OLD_GAS: 
      older flavor of gas which needs help for PIC.
   OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME, OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE,
   OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_OBJECT: 
      PIC support, FUNCTION_NAME/FUNCTION_SIZE are independent, whereas
      the corresponding logic for OBJECTS is necessarily coupled.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

@# The svr4 reference port for the i860 contains an alloca.o routine
# in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a, but we can't just try to get that by
# setting CLIB to /usr/ucblib/libucb.a because (unfortunately)
# there are a lot of other routines in libucb.a which are supposed
# to be the Berkeley versions of library routines normally found in
# libc.a and many of these Berkeley versions are badly broken.  Thus,
# if we try to link programs with libucb.a before libc.a, those
# programs tend to crash.

# Also, the alloca() routine supplied in early version of svr4 for
# the i860 is non-ABI compliant.  It doesn't keep the stack aligned
# to a 16-byte boundary as the ABI requires.

# More importantly however, even a fully ABI compliant alloca() routine
# would fail to work correctly with some versions of the native svr4 C
# compiler currently being distributed for the i860 (as of 1/29/92).
# The problem is that the native C compiler generates non-ABI-compliant
# function epilogues which cut back the stack (upon function exit) in
# an incorrect manner.  Specifically, they cut back the stack by adding
# the nominal *static* frame size (determined statically at compile-time)
# to the stack pointer rather than setting the stack pointer based upon
# the current value of the frame pointer (as called for in the i860 ABI).
# This can cause serious trouble in cases where you repeatedly call a
# routine which itself calls alloca().  In such cases, the stack will
# grow continuously until you finally run out of swap space or exceed
# the system's process size limit.  To avoid this problem (which can
# arise when a stage1 gcc is being used to build a stage2 gcc) you
# *must* link in the C language version of alloca() which is supplied
# with gcc to your stage1 version of gcc.  The following definition
# forces that to happen.

ALLOCA=alloca.o

# We build all stages *without* shared libraries because that may make
# debugging the compiler easier (until there is a GDB which supports
# both Dwarf *and* svr4 shared libraries).

# Note that the native C compiler for the svr4 reference port on the
# i860 recognizes a special -gg option.  Using that option causes *full*
# Dwarf debugging information to be generated, whereas using only -g
# causes only limited Dwarf debugging information to be generated.
# (This is an undocumented feature of the native svr4 C compiler.)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

 *      Install this file as $prefix/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION/gccz.ifile
 *
 *	BLOCK to an offset that leaves room for many headers ( the value
 *	here allows for a file header, an outheader, and up to 11 section 
 *	headers on most systems.
 *	BIND to an address that excludes page 0 from being mapped. The value
 *	used for BLOCK should be or'd into this value. Here I'm setting BLOCK
 *	to 0x200 and BIND to ( 0x400000 | value_used_for(BLOCK) )
 *	If you are using shared libraries, watch that you don't overlap the
 *	address ranges assigned for shared libs.
 *
 *	GROUP BIND to a location in the next segment.  Here, the only value
 *	that you should change (I think) is that within NEXT, which I've set
 *	to my hardware segment size. You can always use a larger size, but not
 *	a smaller one.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

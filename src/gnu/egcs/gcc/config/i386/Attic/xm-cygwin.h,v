@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

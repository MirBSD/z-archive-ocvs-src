@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

# This shell script produces a header file which the gcc driver
# program uses to pick which library to use based on the machine
# specific options that it is given.

# The first argument is a list of sets of options.  The elements in
# the list are separated by spaces.  Within an element, the options
# are separated by slashes.  No leading dash is used on the options.
# Each option in a set is mutually incompatible with all other options
# in the set.

# The optional second argument is a list of subdirectory names.  If
# the second argument is non-empty, there must be as many elements in
# the second argument as there are options in the first argument.  The
# elements in the second list are separated by spaces.  If the second
# argument is empty, the option names will be used as the directory
# names.

# The optional third argument is a list of options which are
# identical.  The elements in the list are separated by spaces.  Each
# element must be of the form OPTION=OPTION.  The first OPTION should
# appear in the first argument, and the second should be a synonym for
# it.  Question marks are replaced with equal signs in both options.

# The optional fourth argument is a list of multilib directory 
# combinations that should not be built.

# The optional fifth argument is a list of options that should be
# used whenever building multilib libraries.

# The output looks like
#   #define MULTILIB_MATCHES "\
#   SUBDIRECTORY OPTIONS;\
#   ...
#   "
# The SUBDIRECTORY is the subdirectory to use.  The OPTIONS are
# multiple options separated by spaces.  Each option may start with an
# exclamation point.  gcc will consider each line in turn.  If none of
# the options beginning with an exclamation point are present, and all
# of the other options are present, that subdirectory will be used.
# The order of the subdirectories is such that they can be created in
# order; that is, a subdirectory is preceded by all its parents.

# Here is a example (this is simplified from the actual 680x0 case):
#   genmultilib "m68000/m68020 msoft-float" "m68000 m68020 msoft-float"
#		"m68000=mc68000"
# This produces:
#   ". !m68000 !mc68000 !m68020 !msoft-float;",
#   "m68000 m68000 !m68020 !msoft-float;",
#   "m68000 mc60000 !m68020 !msoft-float;",
#   "m68020 !m68000 !mc68000 m68020 !msoft-float;",
#   "msoft-float !m68000 !mc68000 !m68020 msoft-float;",
#   "m68000/msoft-float m68000 !m68020 msoft-float;",
#   "m68000/msoft-float mc68000 !m68020 msoft-float;",
#   "m68020/msoft-float !m68000 !mc68000 m68020 msoft-float;",
#
# The effect is that `gcc -msoft-float' (for example) will append
# msoft-float to the directory name when searching for libraries or
# startup files, and `gcc -m68000 -msoft-float' (for example) will
# append m68000/msoft-float.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

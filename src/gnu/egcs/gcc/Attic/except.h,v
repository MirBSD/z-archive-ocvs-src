@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

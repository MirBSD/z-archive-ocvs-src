@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

/* This package implements basic hash table functionality.  It is possible
   to search for an entry, create an entry and destroy an entry.

   Elements in the table are generic pointers.

   The size of the table is not fixed; if the occupancy of the table
   grows too high the hash table will be expanded.

   The abstract data implementation is based on generalized Algorithm D
   from Knuth's book "The art of computer programming".  Hash table is
   expanded by creation of new hash table and transferring elements from
   the old table to the new table.  */

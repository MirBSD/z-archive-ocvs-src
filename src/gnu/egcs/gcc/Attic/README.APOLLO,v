@README.apollo

Building GCC 2.0 for 680x0 based Apollo systems requires the GNU
assembler (GAS) version 1.38.1, with John Vasta's patches applied.

If you haven't done so yet, get `gas-1.38.1.tar.Z' from your favourite
GNU distribution site.  Furthermore, get `apollo-gas-1.38.1.diffs'
from `labrea.stanford.edu:/pub/gnu', apply the patches, compile and
install gas (under the name as).  This should go through without any
problems.

After switching into the BSD environment, you can configure GCC 2.0
with the command 

% ./configure m68k-apollo-bsd

The Apollo's `/usr/include/setjmp.h' uses a nonstandard `#options()'
construct.  You should create a local copy of this file and remove
these constructs from the declarations of SIGSETJMP and SIGLONGJMP.

The Apollo's `/usr/include/sys/types.h' (BSD Version) doesn't allow
to test for the definition of `size_t'.  This should be fixed by

  #ifndef _SIZE_T
  #define _SIZE_T
  typedef	long	size_t;
  #endif

The script `patch-apollo-includes' fixes these two problems, but does
_not_ pretend to be a full fledged `fixincludes' for this system.

If you now follow the standard GCC installation instructions, building
GCC 2.0 (including G++ 2.0) should proceed without any problems.

NB: Debugging is not yet supported for the Apollo.  If someone wants
    to do a _big_ favour to the Apollo users, he/she should consider
    porting the Binary File Description library (BFD) to the Apollo.
    This library can be found in the gdb-4.x distributions or in the
    binutils-1.9x distributions.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

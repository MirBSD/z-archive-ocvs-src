@This is a collection of things that test suites have
said were "wrong" with GCC--but that I don't agree with.

First, test suites sometimes test for compatibility with
traditional C.  GCC with -traditional is not completely
compatible with traditional C, and in some ways I think it
should not be.

* K&R C allowed \x to appear in a string literal (or character
literal?)  even in cases where it is *not* followed by a sequence of
hex digits.  I'm not convinced this is desirable.

* K&R compilers allow comments to cross over an inclusion boundary (i.e.
started in an include file and ended in the including file).
I think this would be quite ugly and can't imagine it could
be needed.

Sometimes tests disagree with GCC's interpretation of the ANSI standard.

* One test claims that this function should return 1.

    enum {A, B} foo;

    func (enum {B, A} arg)
    {
      return B;
    }

I think it should return 0, because the definition of B that
applies is the one in func.

* Some tests report failure when the compiler does not produce
an error message for a certain program.

ANSI C requires a "diagnostic" message for certain kinds of invalid
programs, but a warning counts as a diagnostic.  If GCC produces
a warning but not an error, that is correct ANSI support.
When test suites call this "failure", the tests are broken.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

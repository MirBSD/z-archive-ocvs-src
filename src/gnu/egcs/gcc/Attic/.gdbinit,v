@define pr
set debug_rtx ($)
end

document pr
Print the full structure of the rtx that is $.
Works only when an inferior is executing.
end

define prl
set debug_rtx_list ($, debug_rtx_count)
end

document prl
Print the full structure of all rtx insns beginning at $.
Works only when an inferior is executing.
Uses variable debug_rtx_count to control number of insns printed:
  debug_rtx_count > 0: print from $ on.
  debug_rtx_count < 0: print a window around $.

There is also debug_rtx_find (rtx, uid) that will scan a list for UID and print
it using debug_rtx_list. Usage example: set $foo=debug_rtx_find(first, 42)
end

define pt
set debug_tree ($)
end

document pt
Print the full structure of the tree that is $.
Works only when an inferior is executing.

Print the tree-code of the tree node that is $.

document pbs
In cc1plus, print the current binding stack, frame by frame, up to and
including the global binding level.

# Put this last because gcc does not reference it any more unless

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

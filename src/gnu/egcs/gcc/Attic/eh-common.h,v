@nuke egcs (pgcc, gcc2) and simplify the system a bit
also fix placement of GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR equation in <bsd.own.mk> while here
remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants
for now, all distribution lists are mi, since we only have 1 arch

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

   compiler supports the new runtime typechecking mechanism or not. Under
   the new model, runtime info is contained in the exception table, and
   the __throw() library routine determines which handler to call based
   on the results of a call to a matching function provided by the expcetion
   thrower.  Otherwise the old scheme of calling any handler which matches
   an exception range is used, and the handler is responsible for all
   checking of runtime conditions. If the handler wasn't suppose to
   get the exception, it performs a re-throw. */


/* The handler_label field MUST be the first field in this structure. The 
   __throw()  library routine expects uses __eh_stub() from except.c, which

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

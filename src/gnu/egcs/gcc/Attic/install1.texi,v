@license sweep in gnu:
 - GPL, LGPL and friends:
	Programmes often allow "version blah or any later version".
	This leads to problems, if a later version is unfree. That's
	why each file in GNU is considered a "derived work" from the
	upstream version now, with that clause removed - i.e. you can't
	distribute tinyirc with GPL version 2, for example (unless it
	links against a GPL2'd lib, but then you still won't be able
	to apply a fictional GPLv3).
 - GFDL:
	Refer to the thread on debian-legal, which got attention by
	slashdot. If a GFDL-licensed document contains "invariant
	sections" or "cover texts", it is unfree. That's why some of
	our documentation had to go out. Sorry, GNU folks, but MirBSD
	does not play with your politics - neither would I do with
	Theo's, though you can't call that politics, more policies...

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

<h1 align="center">Installing GCC: Binaries</h1>

<p>We are often asked about pre-compiled versions of GCC. While we cannot
provide these for all platforms, below you'll find links to binaries for
various platforms where creating them by yourself is not easy due to various
reasons.</p>

<p>Please note that we did not create these binaries, nor do we
support them.  If you have any problems installing them, please
contact their makers.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www-frec.bull.com/docs/download.htm">AIX</a>

<li>DOS: <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a>

<li><a href="http://hpux.cae.wisc.edu/">HP-UX Porting Center</a>

<li><a href="http://www.sco.com/skunkware/devtools/index.html#gcc">SCO
    OpenServer/Unixware</a>

<li>Solaris (SPARC, Intel): <a
    href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">Sunfreeware</a>

<li>SGI: <a href="http://freeware.sgi.com/">SGI Freeware</a>

<li>Windows 95, 98, and NT:

    Win32 related projects</a> by Mumit Khan

<li><a href="ftp://ftp.thewrittenword.com/packages/free/by-name/gcc-2.95.2/">The
Written Word</a> offers binaries for Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7/SPARC, 2.7/Intel,
IRIX 6.2, 6.5, Digital UNIX 4.0D, HP-UX 10.20, and HP-UX 11.00.

</ul>

<p>In addition to those specific offerings, you can get a binary
distribution CD-ROM from the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/order/order.html">Free Software
Foundation</a>. It contains binaries for a number of platforms, and
includes not only GCC, but other stuff as well. The current CD does
not contain the latest version of GCC, but it should allow
bootstrapping the compiler. An updated version of that disk is in the
works.</p>

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

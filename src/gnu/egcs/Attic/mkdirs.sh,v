1.2
log
@* remove all GNU Automake files, we don't need them
* disable stupid "if Makefile.am isn't there, I can't build
  Makefile.in so I can't build Makefile so... huh?" stuff
* basically synch lists (base, not x11) with what is gained;
  more review needed
  XXX adjust notes
* various improvements I don't remember
* add configs from the FSF
  (with MirBSD and ekkoBSD support added by myself)
* update some FSF material
* plug some strcpy, strcat, sprintf, mktemp holes
* fix and unify the way where and how the gcc version subdirs are included

XXX someone string-"fix" roff and the gnu part (isdnd will be taken care of later)

1.1
log
@gcc 3.3.1 has proven not ready for prime-time yet.
o isolate libiberty from the gcc tree
o move stuff around for $GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR
o update and sync gcc-2.95 with moved-again libiberty and $GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR
o prepare for nuking gcc 3.3 in favour of gcc 3.2 (if it works)

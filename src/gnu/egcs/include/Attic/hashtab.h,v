/* This package implements basic hash table functionality.  It is possible
   to search for an entry, create an entry and destroy an entry.

   Elements in the table are generic pointers.

   The size of the table is not fixed; if the occupancy of the table
   grows too high the hash table will be expanded.

   The abstract data implementation is based on generalized Algorithm D
   from Knuth's book "The art of computer programming".  Hash table is
   expanded by creation of new hash table and transferring elements from
   the old table to the new table.  */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

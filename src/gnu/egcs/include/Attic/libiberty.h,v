@/* Function declarations for libiberty.
   Written by Cygnus Support, 1994.

   The libiberty library provides a number of functions which are
   missing on some operating systems.  We do not declare those here,
   to avoid conflicts with the system header files on operating
   systems that do support those functions.  In this file we only
   declare those functions which are specific to libiberty.  */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

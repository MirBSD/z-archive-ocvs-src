/* These routines allocate space for an object.  The assumption is
   that the object will want to allocate space as it goes along, but
   will never want to free any particular block.  There is a function
   to free a block, which also frees all more recently allocated
   blocks.  There is also a function to free all the allocated space.

   This is essentially a specialization of obstacks.  The main
   difference is that a block may not be allocated a bit at a time.
   Another difference is that these routines are always built on top
   of malloc, and always pass an malloc failure back to the caller,
   unlike more recent versions of obstacks.  */

   refer to these fields, nor should they allocate these structure

   listed below.  The structure is only defined here so that we can

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

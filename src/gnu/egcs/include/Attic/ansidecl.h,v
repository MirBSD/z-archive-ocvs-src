/* ANSI and traditional C compatibility macros

   ANSI C is assumed if __STDC__ is #defined.

   Macro	ANSI C definition	Traditional C definition
   -----	---- - ----------	----------- - ----------
   PTR		`void *'		`char *'
   LONG_DOUBLE	`long double'		`double'
   VOLATILE	`volatile'		`'
   SIGNED	`signed'		`'
   PTRCONST	`void *const'		`char *'
   ANSI_PROTOTYPES  1			not defined

   CONST is also defined, but is obsolete.  Just use const.

   obsolete --     DEFUN (name, arglist, args)

	Defines function NAME.

	ARGLIST lists the arguments, separated by commas and enclosed in
	parentheses.  ARGLIST becomes the argument list in traditional C.

	ARGS list the arguments with their types.  It becomes a prototype in
	ANSI C, and the type declarations in traditional C.  Arguments should
	be separated with `AND'.  For functions with a variable number of
	arguments, the last thing listed should be `DOTS'.

   obsolete --     DEFUN_VOID (name)

	Defines a function NAME, which takes no arguments.

   obsolete --     EXFUN (name, (prototype))	-- obsolete.

	Replaced by PARAMS.  Do not use; will disappear someday soon.
	Was used in external function declarations.
	In ANSI C it is `NAME PROTOTYPE' (so PROTOTYPE should be enclosed in
	parentheses).  In traditional C it is `NAME()'.
	For a function that takes no arguments, PROTOTYPE should be `(void)'.

   obsolete --     PROTO (type, name, (prototype)    -- obsolete.

	This one has also been replaced by PARAMS.  Do not use.

   PARAMS ((args))

	We could use the EXFUN macro to handle prototype declarations, but
	the name is misleading and the result is ugly.  So we just define a
	simple macro to handle the parameter lists, as in:

	      static int foo PARAMS ((int, char));

	This produces:  `static int foo();' or `static int foo (int, char);'

	EXFUN would have done it like this:

	      static int EXFUN (foo, (int, char));

	but the function is not external...and it's hard to visually parse
	the function name out of the mess.   EXFUN should be considered
	obsolete; new code should be written to use PARAMS.

   DOTS is also obsolete.

   Examples:

	extern int printf PARAMS ((const char *format, ...));

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@* merge (ie, remove) OpenBSD
* merge _some_ of the OpenBSD diffs into libiberty headers (not code)
* copy idea of espie@@openbsd to replace libiberty-md5 by libc-md5,
  but cast more in the header and remove md5.c
* while here - getopt is in libc, too
* bump major of libiberty
* libiberty testsuite passes all but 3 java tests

@/* Simple implementation of vsprintf for systems without it.
   Highly system-dependent, but should work on most "traditional"
   implementations of stdio; newer ones should already have vsprintf.
   Written by Per Bothner of Cygnus Support.
   Based on libg++'s "form" (written by Doug Lea; dl@@rocky.oswego.edu).

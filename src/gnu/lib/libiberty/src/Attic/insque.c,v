1.2
log
@* merge (ie, remove) OpenBSD
* merge _some_ of the OpenBSD diffs into libiberty headers (not code)
* copy idea of espie@@openbsd to replace libiberty-md5 by libc-md5,
  but cast more in the header and remove md5.c
* while here - getopt is in libc, too
* bump major of libiberty
* libiberty testsuite passes all but 3 java tests

@@deftypefn Supplemental void insque (struct qelem *@@var{elem}, struct qelem *@@var{pred})
@@deftypefnx Supplemental void remque (struct qelem *@@var{elem})

Routines to manipulate queues built from doubly linked lists.  The
@@code{insque} routine inserts @@var{elem} in the queue immediately
after @@var{pred}.  The @@code{remque} routine removes @@var{elem} from
its containing queue.  These routines expect to be passed pointers to
structures which have as their first members a forward pointer and a
back pointer, like this prototype (although no prototype is provided):

  struct qelem *q_forw;
  struct qelem *q_back;

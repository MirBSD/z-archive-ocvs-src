1.2
log
@* merge (ie, remove) OpenBSD
* merge _some_ of the OpenBSD diffs into libiberty headers (not code)
* copy idea of espie@@openbsd to replace libiberty-md5 by libc-md5,
  but cast more in the header and remove md5.c
* while here - getopt is in libc, too
* bump major of libiberty
* libiberty testsuite passes all but 3 java tests

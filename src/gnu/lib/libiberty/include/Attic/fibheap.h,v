1.2
log
@* merge (ie, remove) OpenBSD
* merge _some_ of the OpenBSD diffs into libiberty headers (not code)
* copy idea of espie@@openbsd to replace libiberty-md5 by libc-md5,
  but cast more in the header and remove md5.c
* while here - getopt is in libc, too
* bump major of libiberty
* libiberty testsuite passes all but 3 java tests

/* Fibonacci heaps are somewhat complex, but, there's an article in
   DDJ that explains them pretty well:

   http://www.ddj.com/articles/1997/9701/9701o/9701o.htm?topic=algoritms

   Introduction to algorithms by Corman and Rivest also goes over them.

   The original paper that introduced them is "Fibonacci heaps and their
   uses in improved network optimization algorithms" by Tarjan and
   Fredman (JACM 34(3), July 1987).

   Amortized and real worst case time for operations:

   ExtractMin: O(lg n) amortized. O(n) worst case.
   DecreaseKey: O(1) amortized.  O(lg n) worst case. 
   Insert: O(2) amortized. O(1) actual.  
   Union: O(1) amortized. O(1) actual.  */

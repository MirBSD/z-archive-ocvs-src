@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

@@c THIS SECTION IS CRAP AND NEEDS REWRITING BADLY.

To date, @@libib{} is generally not installed on its own.  It has evolved
over years but does not have its own version number nor release schedule.

Possibly the easiest way to use @@libib{} in your projects is to drop the
@@libib{} code into your project's sources, and to build the library along
with your own sources; the library would then be linked in at the end.  This
prevents any possible version mismatches with other copies of libiberty
elsewhere on the system.

Passing @@option{--enable-install-libiberty} to the @@command{configure}
script when building @@libib{} causes the header files and archive library
to be installed when @@kbd{make install} is run.  This option also takes
an (optional) argument to specify the installation location, in the same
manner as @@option{--prefix}.

For your own projects, an approach which offers stability and flexibility
is to include @@libib{} with your code, but allow the end user to optionally
choose to use a previously-installed version instead.  In this way the
user may choose (for example) to install @@libib{} as part of GCC, and use
that version for all software built with that compiler.  (This approach
has proven useful with software using the GNU @@code{readline} library.)

Making use of @@libib{} code usually requires that you include one or more
header files from the @@libib{} distribution.  (They will be named as
necessary in the function descriptions.)  At link time, you will need to
add @@option{-liberty} to your link command invocation.


@@node Overview
@@chapter Overview

Functions contained in @@libib{} can be divided into three general categories.


@@menu
* Supplemental Functions::       Providing functions which don't exist
                                 on older operating systems.

* Replacement Functions::        These functions are sometimes buggy or
                                 unpredictable on some operating systems.

* Extensions::                   Functions which provide useful extensions
                                 or safety wrappers around existing code.
@@end menu

@@node Supplemental Functions
@@section Supplemental Functions
@@cindex supplemental functions
@@cindex functions, supplemental
@@cindex functions, missing

Certain operating systems do not provide functions which have since
become standardized, or at least common.  For example, the Single
Unix Specification Version 2 requires that the @@code{basename}
function be provided, but an OS which predates that specification
might not have this function.  This should not prevent well-written
code from running on such a system.

Similarly, some functions exist only among a particular ``flavor''
or ``family'' of operating systems.  As an example, the @@code{bzero}
function is often not present on systems outside the BSD-derived
family of systems.

Many such functions are provided in @@libib{}.  They are quickly
listed here with little description, as systems which lack them
become less and less common.  Each function @@var{foo} is implemented
in @@file{@@var{foo}.c} but not declared in any @@libib{} header file; more
comments and caveats for each function's implementation are often
available in the source file.  Generally, the function can simply
be declared as @@code{extern}.



@@node Replacement Functions
@@section Replacement Functions
@@cindex replacement functions
@@cindex functions, replacement

Some functions have extremely limited implementations on different
platforms.  Other functions are tedious to use correctly; for example,
proper use of @@code{malloc} calls for the return value to be checked and
appropriate action taken if memory has been exhausted.  A group of
``replacement functions'' is available in @@libib{} to address these issues
for some of the most commonly used subroutines.

All of these functions are declared in the @@file{libiberty.h} header
file.  Many of the implementations will use preprocessor macros set by
GNU Autoconf, if you decide to make use of that program.  Some of these
functions may call one another.


@@menu
* Memory Allocation::            Testing and handling failed memory
                                   requests automatically.
* Exit Handlers::                Calling routines on program exit.
* Error Reporting::              Mapping errno and signal numbers to
                                   more useful string formats.
@@end menu

@@node Memory Allocation
@@subsection Memory Allocation
@@cindex memory allocation

The functions beginning with the letter @@samp{x} are wrappers around
standard functions; the functions provided by the system environment
are called and their results checked before the results are passed back
to client code.  If the standard functions fail, these wrappers will
terminate the program.  Thus, these versions can be used with impunity.


@@node Exit Handlers
@@subsection Exit Handlers
@@cindex exit handlers

The existence and implementation of the @@code{atexit} routine varies
amongst the flavors of Unix.  @@libib{} provides an unvarying dependable
implementation via @@code{xatexit} and @@code{xexit}.


@@node Error Reporting
@@subsection Error Reporting
@@cindex error reporting

These are a set of routines to facilitate programming with the system
@@code{errno} interface.  The @@libib{} source file @@file{strerror.c}
contains a good deal of documentation for these functions.

@@libib{} includes additional functionality above and beyond standard
functions, which has proven generically useful in GNU programs, such as
obstacks and regex.  These functions are often copied from other
projects as they gain popularity, and are included here to provide a
central location from which to use, maintain, and distribute them.

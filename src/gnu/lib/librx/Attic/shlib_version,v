log
@we have global shared library versions now

note for current users: please don't build dynamically right now,
there's some ongoing stuff (time related, doh) for libc missing,
and I won't bump the major for you.
(you _can_ build dynamically if you lower LIBc_VERSION to 0.0 first)

log
@* no more /usr/lib/fpic
* no more /usr/lib/*.la (GNU libtool crap)
* update propolice EXCEPT protector.c to 3.3-7
  (latest protector.c still breaks bootstrap, this works)
* plant way for 32/64-bit mirbsd on x86
* fix major/minor revisions
* optimize printing of drive parametres
* minor fixes, opt., whitespace cleanup

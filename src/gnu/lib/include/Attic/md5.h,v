@for all practical purposes - nobody needs a (void *)
result of MD5Finish(), and to fake it we'd have to
invent a static function, so we'll use just (void).

@* merge (ie, remove) OpenBSD
* merge _some_ of the OpenBSD diffs into libiberty headers (not code)
* copy idea of espie@@openbsd to replace libiberty-md5 by libc-md5,
  but cast more in the header and remove md5.c
* while here - getopt is in libc, too
* bump major of libiberty
* libiberty testsuite passes all but 3 java tests

@gcc 3.3.1 has proven not ready for prime-time yet.
o isolate libiberty from the gcc tree
o move stuff around for $GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR
o update and sync gcc-2.95 with moved-again libiberty and $GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR
o prepare for nuking gcc 3.3 in favour of gcc 3.2 (if it works)

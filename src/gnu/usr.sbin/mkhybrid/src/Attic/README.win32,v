@It turns out that
* mkisofs works
* the "old-style" image built on cdrom34.fs works
* the "new-style" image built on cdboot and with bsd.rd doesn't
  (cdboot seems to be not initialized correctly, will
   look after that later)
* mkhybrid has lived out its life (report regressions
  against mkisofs please)
* we should bump the patchlevel and issue a warning if
  the user installs the cdrtools port
  (I don't delete mkisofs from the port yet, the MirPorts
   framework is currently following MirOS #7 stable)
* I should get my hands on the El Torito standard, and
  a good copy of bochs :)

@mkhybrid can be compiled on Win9X/NT4 using Cygnus' cygwin
available from:

	http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/

To build, start a "bash" shell (open a DOS/Command window, cd to the required
directory and type "bash"), and type "./configure" and "make"

A pre-compiled current Win32 binary is available from:

	ftp://ftp.ge.ucl.ac.uk/pub/mkhfs/win32

To use the pre-compiled binary, extract the files from the Zip archive, put
the files cygwin1.dll, mount.exe and mkhybrid.exe in your WINDOWS directory
and from a Command/MS-DOS window type mkhybrid for usage (also see 
mkhybrid_man.html).

mkhybrid is a Unix command line utility and knows nothing about DOS/WIN.
Therefore all directory names are given in Unix format (i.e. use '/' for a
directory separator, not '\'). To access files on another disk (i.e.
floppy, CDROM and network disk), you need to use the supplied "mount"
command e.g.

mount a: /a
mount d: /cdrom

i.e. files on the floppy disk are accessed as being in directory /a and
files on the CDROM are accessed as /cdrom (assuming your CDROM is drive d:)
e.g. the following command creates a CD image in the current directory
using a source directories on the CDROM drive, a sub-directory and the
floppy drive:

mkhybrid -o hfs.iso -h -J -r /cdrom/subdir dir1 /a 

Please note: Starting with v1.12b5.0 the Win32 executable uses the b20.1
version of the cygwin DLL. If you are using an earlier version of mkhybrid,
then you will need this DLL as well.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

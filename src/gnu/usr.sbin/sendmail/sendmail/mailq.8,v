.Nm mailq
.Nd print the mail queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mailq
.Op Fl \&Ac
.Op Fl q...
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm mailq
prints a summary of the mail messages queued for future delivery.
It may only be run by the superuser.
.Pp
The first line printed for each message
shows the internal identifier used on this host
for the message with a possible status character,
the size of the message in bytes,
the date and time the message was accepted into the queue,
and the envelope sender of the message.
The second line shows the error message that caused this message
to be retained in the queue;
it will not be present if the message is being processed
for the first time.
The status characters are either
.Sq *
to indicate the job is being processed;
.Sq X
to indicate that the load is too high to process the job; and
.Sq -
to indicate that the job is too young to process.
The following lines show message recipients,
one per line.
.Pp
.Nm
is identical to
.Dq Li "sendmail -bp" .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl \&Ac
Show the mail submission queue specified in
.Pa /etc/mail/submit.cf
instead of the MTA queue specified in
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf .
.It Fl q\fR[\fI!\fR] Ns Cm I Ar substr
Limit processed jobs to those containing
.Ar substr
as a substring of the queue id or not when
.Sq !
is specified.
.It Fl q\fR[\fI!\fR] Ns Cm R Ar substr
Limit processed jobs to those containing
.Ar substr
as a substring of one of the recipients or not when
.Sq !
is specified.
.It Fl q\fR[\fI!\fR] Ns Cm S Ar substr
Limit processed jobs to those containing
.Ar substr
as a substring of the sender or not when
.Sq !
is specified.
.It Fl v
Print verbose information.
This adds the priority of the message and
a single character indicator (``+'' or blank)
indicating whether a warning message has been sent
on the first line of the message.
Additionally, extra lines may be intermixed with the recipients
indicating the
.Dq controlling user
information;
this shows who will own any programs that are executed
on behalf of this message
and the name of the alias this command expanded from, if any.
Moreover, status messages for each recipient are printed
if available.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

command appeared in

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the

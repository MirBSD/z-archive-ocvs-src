.Dt SMRSH 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm smrsh
.Nd restricted shell for sendmail
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm smrsh
.Fl c Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm smrsh
program is intended as a replacement for
.Pa /bin/sh
for use in the
.Dq prog
mailer in
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration files.
It sharply limits the commands that can be run using the
.Dq |program
syntax of
.Xr sendmail 8
in order to improve the overall security of your system.
Briefly, even if a
.Dq bad guy
can get sendmail to run a program
without going through an alias or forward file,
.Nm smrsh
limits the set of programs that he or she can execute.
.Pp
Briefly,
.Nm smrsh
limits programs to be in a single directory, by default
.Pa /usr/libexec/sm.bin ,
allowing the system administrator to choose the set of acceptable commands,
and the shell builtin commands
.Dq exec ,
.Dq exit ,
and
.Dq echo .
It also rejects any commands with the characters
.Sq \e ,
.Sq < ,
.Sq > ,
.So
;
.Sc ,
.Sq $ ,
.So
(
.Sc ,
.So
)
.Sc ,
.Sq \er
(carriage return), or
.Sq \en
(newline) on the command line to prevent
.Dq end run
attacks.
It allows
.Dq ||
and
.Dq &&
to enable commands like:
.Bd -literal -compact -offset "XXXX"
.Qq "|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- /etc/procmailrcs/user || exit 75"
.Ed
.Pp
Initial pathnames on programs are stripped,
so forwarding to
.Pa /usr/ucb/vacation ,
.Pa /usr/bin/vacation ,
.Pa /home/server/mydir/bin/vacation ,
and
.Pa vacation
all actually forward to
.Pa /usr/libexec/sm.bin/vacation .
.Pp
System administrators should be conservative about populating
the sm.bin directory.
Reasonable additions are
.Xr vacation 1 ,
.Xr procmail ,
and the like.
No matter how brow-beaten you may be,
never include any shell or shell-like program
(such as
.Xr perl 1 )
in the
sm.bin
directory.
Note that this does not restrict the use of shell or perl scripts
in the sm.bin directory (using the
.Dq #!
syntax);
it simply disallows execution of arbitrary programs.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed
stable enough.

@Fuck. Two times two upgrades to the same product in row.
Man, can't you guys handle this more smoothly?

Well, sendmail 8.12.10 or so, and OpenBSD-current.

For example, a reasonable additions is

Also, including mail filtering programs such as
.Xr procmail
is a very bad idea.
.Xr procmail
allows users to run arbitrary programs in their
.Xr procmailrc .

@Import OpenBSD as of today again (seems pretty stable, I hope)

Prominent changes: more bgpd, tcpmd5; tcpdump/isakmpd fixes

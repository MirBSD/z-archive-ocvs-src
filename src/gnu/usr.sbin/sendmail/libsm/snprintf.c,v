**  SM_SNPRINTF -- format a string to a memory location of restricted size
**
**	Parameters:
**		str -- memory location to place formatted string
**		n -- size of buffer pointed to by str, capped to
**			a maximum of INT_MAX
**		fmt -- the formatting directives
**		... -- the data to satisfy the formatting
**
**	Returns:
**		Failure: -1
**		Success: number of bytes that would have been written
**			to str, not including the trailing '\0',
**			up to a maximum of INT_MAX, as if there was
**			no buffer size limitation.  If the result >= n
**			then the output was truncated.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		If n > 0, then between 0 and n-1 bytes of formatted output
**		are written into 'str', followed by a '\0'.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

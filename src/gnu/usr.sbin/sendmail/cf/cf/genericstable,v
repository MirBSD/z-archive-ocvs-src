# sendmail(8) generics table.  Rebuild by running as root:
#   makemap hash /etc/mail/genericstable </etc/mail/genericstable
#
# This file contains the mapping of local to external addresses.
# It is often used to map login names to First.Last name style
# email addresses.
#
# Each line denotes a transform of:
#   local_address	external_address
#
# Where local_address is usually unqualified.
#
# E.g.
#   peter		Peter.Parker@@bugle.com
#
# It is also possible to rewrite non-local address from one or more
# domains using the GENERICS_DOMAIN or GENERICS_DOMAIN_FILE macros.
# This is usally used on an outgoing mail hub to rewrite addresses
# from different subsidiaries or departments to include the parent
# domain (in addition to the First.Last name mapping).  E.g.
#
#   joe@@dept.company.com	Joe.Bloggs@@company.com
#
# See the "genericstable" section of /usr/share/sendmail/README for
# more information.

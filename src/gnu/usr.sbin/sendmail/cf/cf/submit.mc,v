@as per bsiegert@@ wish, don't say 8BITMIME when we're not really.
this allows us to default again to strip-8th-bit.

@Specify that the sendmail submit agent uses ::1 (type
INET6_ADDR) by default to talk to the sendmail mt agent,
not localhost (type HOSTNAME).

Solves problems on my router as well, and seems to match
(after a quick google) the FreeBSD defaults, except for
that we use IPv6 of course.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Fuck. Two times two upgrades to the same product in row.
Man, can't you guys handle this more smoothly?

Well, sendmail 8.12.10 or so, and OpenBSD-current.

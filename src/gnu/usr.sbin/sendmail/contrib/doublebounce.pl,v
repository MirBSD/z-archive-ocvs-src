# doublebounce.pl
#
# Return a doubly-bounced e-mail to postmaster.  Specific to sendmail,
# updated to work on sendmail 8.12.6.
#
# Based on the original doublebounce.pl code by jr@@terra.net, 12/4/97.
# Updated by bicknell@@ufp.org, 12/4/2002 to understand new sendmail DSN
# bounces.  Code cleanup also performed, mainly making things more
# robust.
#
# Original intro included below, lines with ##
##	attempt to return a doubly-bounced email to a postmaster
##	jr@@terra.net, 12/4/97
##
##	invoke by creating an mail alias such as:
##		doublebounce:	"|/usr/local/sbin/doublebounce"
##	then adding this line to your sendmail.cf:
##		O DoubleBounceAddress=doublebounce
##
##	optionally, add a "-d" flag in the aliases file, to send a
##	debug trace to your own postmaster showing what is going on
##
##	this allows the "postmaster" address to still go to a human being,
##	while bounce messages can go to this script, which will bounce them
##	back to the postmaster at the sending site.
##
##	the algorithm is to scan the double-bounce error report generated
##	by sendmail on stdin, for the original message (it starts after the
##	second "Orignal message follows" marker), look for From, Sender, and
##	Received headers from the point closest to the sender back to the point
##	closest to us, and try to deliver a double-bounce report back to a
##	postmaster at one of these sites in the hope that they can
##	return the message to the original sender, or do something about
##	the fact that that sender's return address is not valid.

@Fuck. Two times two upgrades to the same product in row.
Man, can't you guys handle this more smoothly?

Well, sendmail 8.12.10 or so, and OpenBSD-current.

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

<h1 class="centered"><a name="top">Chapter 25:  Algorithms</a></h1>

<p>Chapter 25 deals with the generalized subroutines for automatically
   transforming lemmings into gold.

<h2><a name="1">Prerequisites</a></h2>
   <p>The neatest accomplishment of the algorithms chapter is that all the
      work is done via iterators, not containers directly.  This means two
      important things:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>Anything that behaves like an iterator can be used in one of
          these algorithms.  Raw pointers make great candidates, thus
          built-in arrays are fine containers, as well as your own iterators.
      </li>
      <li>The algorithms do not (and cannot) affect the container as a
          whole; only the things between the two iterator endpoints.  If
          you pass a range of iterators only enclosing the middle third of
          a container, then anything outside that range is inviolate.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>Even strings can be fed through the algorithms here, although the
      string class has specialized versions of many of these functions (for
      example, <code>string::find()</code>).  Most of the examples on this
      page will use simple arrays of integers as a playground for
      algorithms, just to keep things simple.
      <a name="Nsize">The use of <strong>N</strong></a> as a size in the
      examples is to keep things easy to read but probably won't be valid
      code.  You can use wrappers such as those described in the
      <a href="../23_containers/howto.html">containers chapter</a> to keep
      real code readable.
   </p>
   <p>The single thing that trips people up the most is the definition of 
      <em>range</em> used with iterators; the famous
      &quot;past-the-end&quot; rule that everybody loves to hate.  The
      <a href="../24_iterators/howto.html#2">iterators chapter</a> of this
      document has a complete explanation of this simple rule that seems to
      cause so much confusion.  Once you get <em>range</em> into your head
      (it's not that hard, honest!), then the algorithms are a cakewalk.
   </p>
   <p>Return <a href="#top">to top of page</a> or
      <a href="../faq/index.html">to the FAQ</a>.
   </p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="2">Special <code>swap</code>s</a></h2>
   <p>If you call <code> std::swap(x,y); </code> where x and y are standard
      containers, then the call will automatically be replaced by a call to
      <code> x.swap(y); </code> instead.
   </p>
   <p>This allows member functions of each container class to take over, and
      containers' swap functions should have O(1) complexity according to
      the standard.  (And while &quot;should&quot; allows implementations to
      behave otherwise and remain compliant, this implementation does in
      fact use constant-time swaps.)  This should not be surprising, since
      for two containers of the same type to swap contents, only some
      internal pointers to storage need to be exchanged.
   </p>

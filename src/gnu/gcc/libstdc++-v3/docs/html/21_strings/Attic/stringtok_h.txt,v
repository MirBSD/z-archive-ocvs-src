@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

@/*
 * stringtok.h -- Breaks a string into tokens.  This is an example for lib3.
 *
 * Template function looks like this:
 *
 *    template <typename Container>
 *    void stringtok (Container &l,
 *                    string const &s,
 *                    char const * const ws = " \t\n");
 *
 * A nondestructive version of strtok() that handles its own memory and can
 * be broken up by any character(s).  Does all the work at once rather than
 * in an invocation loop like strtok() requires.
 *
 * Container is any type that supports push_back(a_string), although using
 * list<string> and deque<string> are indicated due to their O(1) push_back.
 * (I prefer deque<> because op[]/at() is available as well.)  The first
 * parameter references an existing Container.
 *
 * s is the string to be tokenized.  From the parameter declaration, it can
 * be seen that s is not affected.  Since references-to-const may refer to
 * temporaries, you could use stringtok(some_container, readline("")) when
 * using the GNU readline library.
 *
 * The final parameter is an array of characters that serve as whitespace.
 * Whitespace characters default to one or more of tab, space, and newline,
 * in any combination.
 *
 * 'l' need not be empty on entry.  On return, 'l' will have the token
 * strings appended.
 *
 *
 * [Example:
 *       list<string>       ls;
 *       stringtok (ls, " this  \t is\t\n  a test  ");
 *       for (list<string>::const_iterator i = ls.begin();
 *            i != ls.end(); ++i)
 *       {
 *            cerr << ':' << (*i) << ":\n";
 *       }
 *
 *  would print
 *       :this:
 *       :is:
 *       :a:
 *       :test:
 * -end example]

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

<h1 class="centered"><a name="top">Licenses for the Library</a></h1>

<p>There are two licenses affecting GNU libstdc++-v3:  one for the code, and
   one for the documentation.  Here we will describe both of them, and try
   to answer some of the widespread questions.  If you have more questions,
   ask the FSF or the
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html">gcc mailing list</a>; the person
   writing this page is a programmer, not a lawyer.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Code:  Runtime GPL</h2>

<p>The source code of libstdc++-v3 is distributed under version 2 of the
   <a href="COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>, with the so-called
   &quot;runtime exception,&quot; as follows (or see any header or
   implementation file):
</p>
<pre>
   As a special exception, you may use this file as part of a free software
   library without restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate
   templates or use macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile
   this file and link it with other files to produce an executable, this
   file does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however
   invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.
</pre>

<p>Hopefully that text is self-explanatory.  If it isn't, you need to speak
   to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.
</p>

<!-- Most of the Q&A's are based on, paraphrased from, and outright stolen
     from this thread:
     http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2000-q2/subjects.html#00050
-->
<p><strong>Q:  So any program which uses libstdc++ falls under the GPL?</strong>
 <br />A:  <strong>No.</strong>  The special exception permits use of the
     library in proprietary applications.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:  How is that different from the GNU {Lesser,Library}
   GPL?</strong>
 <!-- Quoting Jason Merrill from the thread above: -->
 <br />A:  The LGPL requires that users be able to replace the LGPL code with a
     modified version; this is trivial if the library in question is a C
     shared library.  But there's no way to make that work with C++, where
     much of the library consists of inline functions and templates, which
     are expanded inside the code that uses the library.  So to allow people
     to replace the library code, someone using the library would have to
     distribute their own source, rendering the LGPL equivalent to the GPL.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:  I see.  So, what restrictions <em>are</em> there on
   programs that use the library?</strong>
 <br />A:  None.  We encourage such programs to be released as open source,
     but we won't punish you or sue you if you choose otherwise.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Docs:  FDL</h2>

<p>The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
   web, including the pages generated from source comments, are copyrighted
   by the Free Software Foundation, and placed under
   the <a href="COPYING.DOC">GNU Free Documentation License version 1.1</a>.
   There are no Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and
   <!-- as far as I know -->
   no Invariant Sections.
</p>

<p>If you plan on making copies of the documentation, please let us know.
   We can probably offer suggestions.

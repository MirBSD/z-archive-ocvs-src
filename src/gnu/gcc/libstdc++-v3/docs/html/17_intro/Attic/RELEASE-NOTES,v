@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

Release Notes   
-------------
The Standard C++ Library, or libstdc++-v3, is an ongoing project
to fully implement the ISO 14882 Standard C++ library as described in
chapters 17 through 27 and annex D.

This is the fifteenth snapshot of the libstdc++ rewrite.  It still
has some incomplet and incorrekt parts, but it's a lot less incomplete
and incorrect than some of the earlier snapshots, and quite usable.

The Standard C++ Library, follows an open development model,
attempting to be fully buzzword, bazaar, and GNU compliant. Full
details on participating, including contributor guidelines, mailing
list subscription, mailing list archives, up-to-date documentation,
and various and sundry other details can be found at the following
URL:

  http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/


New: 
--- 
- more doxygen documentation
- more named locale fixups
- stdio_filebuf that takes fd, FILE
- io performance tuning
- allocation tuning, valgrind fixups
- __cxa_demangle now supported


Bugs fixed:
-----------
6533, 6513, 6501, 6511, 5820, 6414, 4150, 6360, 4164, 1072, 6124,
5180, 3457, 3139, 5268, 3983, 5542, 3129, 5207, 3719, 5734
+ others.


What doesn't:
-------------
- see BUGS.

 
Build and Install
-----------------
Up to date build and install directions can be found at:
http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/install.html


Contact:
--------
Places have changed from previous snapshots.  The web page, which has
information about joining the mailing list and searching its archives,
CVS access, and contribution information is now at:

  http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/

Please note that the mailing list has moved, and is now hosted on
gcc.gnu.org. (The web site above has the most up-to-date info.)
   
Obtain the library snapshot via ftp (including these release notes) from

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/libstdc++/

The library is maintained by Benjamin Kosnik, Gabriel
Dos Reis, Phil Edwards, Ulrich Drepper, Loren James Rittle,
and Paolo Carlini.  


Development tools:
------------------

You will need a current version of gcc to compile this snapshot of
libstdc++. The use of the latest stable gcc-3.0.x release (3.0.4), CVS
gcc, or gcc-3_1-branch is strongly recommended, which may also
introduce additional dependencies for up-to-date binutils. In
particular, current binutils (2.12) is recommended so that symbol
versioning for the library is on by default. In addition, you may need
up-to-date tools for modifying Makefiles and regenerating configure
scripts: automake (version 1.4), autoconf (version 2.13 and higher),
and libtool.

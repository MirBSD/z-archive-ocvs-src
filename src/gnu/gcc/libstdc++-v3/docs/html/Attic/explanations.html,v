@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

<h3><a name="cstdio">&quot;I/O packages&quot;, <code>--enable-cstdio</code></a></h3>
<p>In addition to all the nifty things which C++ can do for I/O, its library
   also includes all of the I/O capabilites of C.  Making them work together
   can be a challenge, not only
   <a href="27_io/howto.html#8">for the programmer</a> but for the
   implementors as well.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to do a C++ library:  the cool way, and the easy way.
   More specifically, the cool-but-easy-to-get-wrong way, and the
   easy-to-guarantee-correct-behavior way.  For 3.0, the easy way is used.
</p>
<p>Choosing 'stdio' is the easy way.  It builds a C++ library which forwards
   all operations to the C library.  Many of the C++ I/O functions are
   specified in the standard 'as if' they called a certain C function; the
   easiest way to get it correct is to actually call that function.  The
   disadvantage is that the C++ code will run slower (fortunately, the layer
   is thin).
</p>
<p>Choosing 'libio' is the cool way; it allows C++ and C to share some
   buffers.  It's disabled because of tricky synchronization issues.  Other
   cool ways (various methods of sharing resources between C and C++
   facilities, instead of layering) are possible.  This approach can speed
   up I/O significantly.
</p>
<p>Other packages are possible.  For a new package, a header must be
   written to provide types like streamsize (usually just a typedef), as
   well as some internal types like<code> __c_file_type </code> and
   <code> __c_lock </code> (for the stdio case, these are FILE (as in
   &quot;FILE*&quot;) and a simple POSIX mutex, respectively).  An
   interface class called <code> __basic_file </code> must also be filled in;
   as an example, for the stdio case, these member functions are all
   inline calles to fread, fwrite, etc.

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

.TH Intro 3 "27 March 2002" "GNU libstdc++-v3" "Standard C++ Library"
.SH NAME
Intro \- Introduction to the GNU libstdc++-v3 man pages
.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page serves as a brief introduction to the GNU implementation of
the Standard C++ Library.  For a better introduction and more complete
documentation, see the
.B libstdc++-v3
homepage listed at the end.
.P
All standard library entities are declared within
.I namespace std
and have manual entries beginning with "std_".  For example, to see
documentation of the template class
.I std::vector
one would use "man std_vector".  Some entities do not have a separate man
page; for those see the main listing in "man Namespace_Std".
.P
All the man pages are automatically generated by Doxygen.  For more
information on this tool, see the HTML counterpart to these man pages.
.P
Some man pages do not correspond to individual classes or functions.  Rather
they describe categories of the Standard Library.  (For a more thorough
introduction to the various categories, consult a text such as Josuttis'
or Austern's.)  These category pages are:
.P
.\" These are separated by ONE TAB.  Nothing else.  I don't like it either.
.\" Keep them alphabatized.
.TS
lB l.
Allocators	Classes encapsulating memory allocation schemes.
Arithmetic_functors	Functors for basic math.
Assoc_containers	Key-based containers.
Binder_functors	Functors which "remember" an argument.
Comparison_functors	Functors wrapping built-in comparisons.
Containers	An introduction to container classes.
Func_ptr_functors	Functors for use with pointers to functions.
Intro	This page.
Intro_functors	An introduction to function objects, or functors.
Iterator_types	Programatically distinguishing iterators/pointers.
Logical_functors	Functors wrapping the Boolean operations.
Member_ptr_functor	Functors for use with pointers to members.
Namespace_Std	A listing of the contents of std::.
Negation_functors	Functors which negate their contents.
SGIextensions	A list of the extensions from the SGI STL subset.
Sequences	Linear containers.

read FAQ 5.4 and use a

.B ext/

.SS Libraries
.TP
.I libstdc++.a
The library implementation in static archive form.  If you did not configure
libstdc++-v3 to use shared libraries, this will always be used.  Otherwise
it will only be used if the user requests it.
.TP
.I libsupc++.a
This library contains C++ language support routines.  Usually you will never
need to know about it, but it can be useful.  See FAQ 2.5.
.TP
.I libstdc++.so[.N]
The library implementation in shared object form.  This will be used in
preference to the static archive form by default.  Currently N will either
start with 3 or with 4, but your system vendor may change the name as they
see fit.  If N is in the 2.x series, then you are looking at the old
libstdc++-v2 library, which we do not maintain.
.TP
.I libstdc++.la
.TP
.I libsupc++.la
These are Libtool library files, and should only be used when working with
that tool.
.SH CONFORMING TO
Almost conforming to
.BI "International Standard ISO/IEC 14882:1998(E), " "Programming Languages --- C++"
(aka the C++ standard), in addition to corrections proposed by the Library

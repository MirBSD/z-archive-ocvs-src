@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

     Originally generated by Doxygen 1.2.12.

     This used to be surrounded by /* */ marks and tagged with @@mainpage, so
     that Doxygen would create the index page from it.  HOWEVER, Doxygen
     ignores all but the most basic HTML tags, and even with those it strips
     all the attributes.  (See, the HTML you write for @@mainpage isn't used
     directly; it all gets run through Doxygen and re-output.)  So lots of
     tags were all being mangled.

     Funk 'dat.  Now we let Doxygen do whatever it feels like doing for the
     index page, and then we just flat copy this over top of it.  Voila!
     Tags actually work like they're supposed to in HTML.

<h1>libstdc++-v3 Source Documentation</h1>

<h2> Documentation Overview </h2>

<p class="smallertext">@@LEVEL@@-level docs, generated @@DATE@@.</p>

<p>There are two types of documentation for libstdc++-v3.  One is the
   distribution documentation, which can be read online at
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/documentation.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/documentation.html</a>
   or offline from docs/html/documentation.html in the library source
   directory.
</p>

<p>The other type is the source documentation, of which this is the first page.
   Both &quot;user-level&quot; and &quot;maintainer-level&quot; source
   documentation is produced:  user-level docs are for the users of this
   library.  The maint-level docs are for those interested in the underlying
   workings of the library; they include all the user-level docs plus
   additional notes and additional classes/functions/etc.
</p>

<p>Here are quick links to the pages which we seem to use the most; a full
   index is at the bottom:
   <!-- Keep this in sync with below. -->
   <ul>
    <li><a href="annotated.html">Compound List</a>
    <li><a href="classes.html">Alphabetical List</a>
    <li><a href="files.html">File List</a>
    <li><a href="modules.html">Modules</a>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2> Generating this file </h2>
<p>These HTML pages are automatically generated, along with the man pages.
   The Makefile rules <code> 'make doxygen' </code> and
   <code> 'make doxygen-maint' </code> in the libstdc++-v3 build directory
   generates these pages using a tool called, appropriately enough, Doxygen.
   To learn more about Doxygen, take a look at
   <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">
   <!-- snagged from the generated page -->
   <img src="doxygen.png" alt="the Doxygen homepage"
        align=center border=0 width=110 height=53>
   </a>
</p>

<p>The libstdc++-v3 configuration files needed to generate doxygen output
   are located:
   <ul><li><code>docs/doxygen/user.cfg.in</code>
       <li><code>docs/doxygen/run_doxygen</code>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2> libstdc++-v3 doxygen style guide </h2>
<p>In general, libstdc++-v3 files should be formatted according to the
   GNU C++ Coding Standard rules found in the file <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/C++STYLE">C++STYLE</a>.
   Before any doxygen-specific formatting tweaks are made, please try to
   make sure that the initial formatting is sound.
</p>

<p>The formatting guidelines for using libstdc++-v3 with doxygen are still
   incomplete.  There seems to be a marginal preference for the use of
   Java-Doc style formatting, with the idea that the single-line style
   (triple-slash) is the least intrusive mechanism for getting libstdc++-v3
   documented and cross-referenced while at the same time minimizing
   disruption to the current formatting.  Full documentation of functions
   (parameter types, return values, etc) will require the slash-splat-splat
   &quot;extended C&quot; commenting style.
</p>

<h2> Full page index </h2>
<p>Here are entry points to all the pages generated by Doxygen:
   <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Main Page</a>
    <li><a href="modules.html">Modules</a>
    <li><a href="namespaces.html">Namespace List</a>
    <li><a href="hierarchy.html">Class Hierarchy</a>
    <li><a href="classes.html">Alphabetical List</a>
    <li><a href="annotated.html">Compound List</a>
    <li><a href="files.html">File List</a>
    <li><a href="namespacemembers.html">Namespace Members</a>
    <li><a href="functions.html">Compound Members</a>
    <li><a href="globals.html">File Members</a>
    <li><a href="todo.html">TODO List</a> (This is incomplete... how ironic.)
   </ul>
</p>


<h2> License, Copyright, and Other Lawyerly Verbosity </h2>
<p>The libstdc++-v3 documentation is released under
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/license.html">
   these terms</a>.
</p>
<p>Part of the generated documentation involved comments

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

   This just provides documentation for stuff that doesn't need to be in the

   that it triggers many different text editors into doing Nice Things when
   typing comments.  However, it is mentioned nowhere except the *cfg.in files.

   Some actual code (declarations) is exposed here, but no compiler ever
   sees it.  The decls must be visible to doxygen, and sometimes their real

/** @@addtogroup Containers Containers
Containers are collections of objects.

A container may hold any type which meets certain requirements, but the type
of contained object is chosen at compile time, and all objects in a given
container must be of the same type.  (Polymorphism is possible by declaring a
container of pointers to a base class and then populating it with pointers to
instances of derived classes.  Variant value types such as the @@c any class
from <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> can also be used.

All contained types must be @@c Assignable and @@c CopyConstructible.
Specific containers may place additional requirements on the types of
their contained objects.

Containers manage memory allocation and deallocation themselves when
storing your objects.  The objects are destroyed when the container is
itself destroyed.  Note that if you are storing pointers in a container,
@@c delete is @@e not automatically called on the pointers before destroying them.

All containers must meet certain requirements, summarized in
<a href="tables.html">tables</a>.

The standard containers are further refined into
@@link Sequences Sequences@@endlink and
@@link Assoc_containers Associative Containers@@endlink.
*/

/** @@addtogroup Sequences Sequences
Sequences arrange a collection of objects into a strictly linear order.

The differences between sequences are usually due to one or both of the
following:
  - memory management
  - algorithmic complexity

As an example of the first case, @@c vector is required to use a contiguous
memory layout, while other sequences such as @@c deque are not.

The prime reason for choosing one sequence over another should be based on
the second category of differences, algorithmic complexity.  For example, if
you need to perform many inserts and removals from the middle of a sequence,
@@c list would be ideal.  But if you need to perform constant-time access to
random elements of the sequence, then @@c list should not be used.

All sequences must meet certain requirements, summarized in
<a href="tables.html">tables</a>.
*/

/** @@addtogroup Assoc_containers Associative Containers
Associative containers allow fast retrieval of data based on keys.

Each container type is parameterized on a @@c Key type, and an ordering
relation used to sort the elements of the container.

There should be more text here.

All associative containers must meet certain requirements, summarized in
<a href="tables.html">tables</a>.

                     is stored.  If @@a output_buffer is not long enough,
                     it is expanded using realloc.  @@a output_buffer may
                     instead be NULL; in that case, the demangled name is
                     placed in a region of memory allocated with malloc.

@@param length If @@a length is non-NULL, the length of the buffer containing
              the demangled name is placed in @@a *length.

@@param status @@a *status is set to one of the following values:
              -   0: The demangling operation succeeded.
              -  -1: A memory allocation failiure occurred.

                     mangling rules.

@@return A pointer to the start of the NUL-terminated demangled name, or NULL
        if the demangling fails.  The caller is responsible for deallocating
        this memory using @@c free.


The demagling is performed using the C++ ABI mangling rules, with
GNU extensions.  For example, this function is used
in __gnu_cxx::__verbose_terminate_handler.  See
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/18_support/howto.html#5 for other
examples of use.

@@note The same demangling functionality is available via libiberty 
(@@c <libiberty/demangle.h> and @@c libiberty.a) in GCC 3.1 and later, but that
requires explicit installation (@@c --enable-install-libiberty) and uses a
different API, although the ABI is unchanged.

/** @@addtogroup binarysearch Binary search algorithms
These algorithms are variations of a classic binary search.  They all assume
that the sequence being searched is already sorted.

The number of comparisons will be logarithmic (and as few as possible).
The number of steps through the sequence will be logarithmic for
random-access iterators (e.g., pointers), and linear otherwise.

The LWG has passed Defect Report 270, which notes:  <em>The proposed
resolution reinterprets binary search. Instead of thinking about searching
for a value in a sorted range, we view that as an important special
case of a more general algorithm: searching for the partition point in a
partitioned range.  We also add a guarantee that the old wording did not:
we ensure that the upper bound is no earlier than the lower bound, that
the pair returned by equal_range is a valid range, and that the first part
of that pair is the lower bound.</em>

The actual effect of the first sentence is that a comparison functor
passed by the user doesn't necessarily need to induce a strict weak ordering
relation.  Rather, it partitions the range.

@we have global shared library versions now

note for current users: please don't build dynamically right now,
there's some ongoing stuff (time related, doh) for libc missing,
and I won't bump the major for you.
(you _can_ build dynamically if you lower LIBc_VERSION to 0.0 first)

Note: this is a pre-snapshot, pre-build commit. Nothing
of this has actually been tested.

Like I said, please wait for the snapshot. Though, the
snapshot doesn't have any more circumstances preventing
me from working towards a release and upload now.

log
@crank major to 31.0
rationale:
 openbsd has 32.0 and gcc 3.3.2

note, before it was 5.4, and programmes linked against
libestdc++.so.5.3 worked just fine with it, so I don't
see (or haven't encountered YET) the problem.

but then, safe is safe.

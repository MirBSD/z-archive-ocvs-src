@{ Pascal declarations of the GPC Run Time System that are visible to
  each program.

  This unit contains Pascal declarations of many RTS routines which
  are not built into the compiler and can be called from programs.
  Don't copy the declarations from this unit into your programs, but
  rather include this unit with a `uses' statement. The reason is
  that the internal declarations, e.g. the linker names, may change,
  and this unit will be changed accordingly. @@@@In the future, this
  unit might be included into every program automatically, so there
  will be no need for a `uses' statement to make the declarations
  here available.

  Note about `protected var' parameters:
  Since `const' parameters in GPC may be passed by value *or* by
  reference internally, possibly depending on the system,
  `const foo*' parameters to C functions *cannot* reliably be
  declared as `const' in Pascal. However, Extended Pascal's
  `protected var' can be used since this guarantees passing by
  reference.

{$error
Trying to compile gpc.pas with a non-matching GPC version is likely
to cause problems.

In case you are building the RTS separately from GPC, make sure you
install a current GPC version previously. If you are building GPC
now and this message appears, something is wrong -- if you are
overriding the GCC_FOR_TARGET or GPC_FOR_TARGET make variables, this
might be the problem. If you are cross-building GPC, build and
install a current GPC cross-compiler first, sorry. If that's not the
case, please report it as a bug.

If you are not building GPC or the RTS currently, you might have
installed things in the wrong place, so the compiler and RTS
versions do not match.}

@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

1.2
log
@since the gpc people (and others) state gcc 3.3 isn't production quality yet,
let's just play with gpc and the other funky stuff right now, even if that
means still no sparc-gcc3 in current.

also, NO_CXX and friends change from defined/undef'd to yes/no

log
@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

@Changes for $2 from $1.

Changes in files you can reconstruct with Bison, etags, makeinfo,
and TeX have been omitted. Some of these files are updated just by
building the compiler. You can update the rest of these files by
executing this command

   make -f Make-lang.in srcdir=".." pascal.generated-files

in the directory of GPC sources, provided the necessary tools
(etags, makeinfo, TeX and texi2dvi) are installed.

To apply these diffs, go to the directory `$1' and use the command

    patch -p1

feeding it the following diffs as input.
Then rename the directory to `$2'.

log
@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

@This directory and the subdirectoreis contain the GNU Pascal
documentation.

To read the English info files on-line, type

  info --file info/gpc.info

If you prefer a printable documentation, run one of the following
commands in the GPC build directory:

  make gpc.dvi          Create a DVI file

  make gpc.ps           Create a PostScript file

If you prefer HTML documentation, get and install the `texi2html'
program, version 1.61 (needs perl) and run one of the following
commands in the GPC build directory:

  make p/html/gpc.html  Create HTML files in a p/html subdirectory

  make pascal.html      Create the complete GPC web page in p/html,
                        including all the other files.

@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

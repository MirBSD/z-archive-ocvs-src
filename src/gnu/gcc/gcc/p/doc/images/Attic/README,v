@This directory contains images used in the GNU Pascal manual and web
site.

The following file formats are used for the files in this directory
and should be used for future additions:

- PNG for pixel graphics (computer drawings, and black/white scanned
  images, etc.),

- JPEG for color or gray-scale scanned photographs etc. (currently
  no such files present),

- EPS for PostScript versions of all images (pixel or vector), used
  for the PS version of the manual,

- PDF for PDF versions of vectorized graphics, used in the PDF
  version of the manual. (Note: Since pdftex can read PNG and JPEG
  files, it is not necessary to provide PDF versions of pixel
  graphics.)

GnuPascal.eps is a vectorized drawing, generated from the pixel
graphic GnuPascal.png using AutoTrace. (GnuPascal.png was scanned
from Markus' hand-drawing.) GnuPascal.pdf is also vectorized and was
generated from GnuPascal.eps using ps2pdf.

gradient.pdf was generated using demos/gradient.pas. gradient.eps
was hand-written (using a PostScript loop to save space, while not
requiring PostScript level 3 which has built-in gradient support).
gradient.pdf was generated from it using ps2pdf.

@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

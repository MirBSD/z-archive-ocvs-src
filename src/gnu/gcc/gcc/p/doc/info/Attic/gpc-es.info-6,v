Interfacing with Other Languages
================================

   The standardized GNU compiler back-end makes it relatively easy to
share libraries between GNU Pascal and other GNU compilers. On
Unix-like platforms (_not_ on Dos-like platforms), the GNU compiler
back-end usually complies to the standards defined for that system, so
communication with other compilers should be easy, too.

   In this chapter we discuss how to import libraries written in other
languages, and how to import libraries written in GNU Pascal from other
languages. While the examples will specialize to compatibility to GNU
C, generalization is straightforward if you are familiar with the other
language in question.

Importing Libraries from Other Languages
----------------------------------------

   To use a function written in another language, you need to provide
an external declaration for it - either in the program, or in the
interface part of a unit, or a module.

   Let's say you want to use the following C library from Pascal:

     File `callc.c':
     
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include "callc.h"
     
     int foo = 1;
     
     void bar (void)
     {
       sleep (foo);
     }

     File `callc.h':
     
     /* Actually, we wouldn't need this header file, and could instead
        put these prototypes into callc.c, unless we want to use callc.c
        also from other C source files. */
     
     extern int foo;
     extern void bar (void);

   Then your program can look like this:

     program CallCDemo;
     
     {$L callc.c}  { Or: `callc.o' if you don't have the source }
     
     var
       MyFoo: Integer; external name 'foo';
     
     procedure Bar; external name 'bar';
     
     begin
       MyFoo := 42;
       Bar
     end.

   Or, if you want to provide a `CallCUnit' unit:

     unit CallCUnit;
     
     interface
     
     var
       MyFoo: Integer; external name 'foo';
     
     procedure Bar; external name 'bar';
     
     implementation
     
     {$L callc.c}  { Or: `callc.o' if you don't have the source }
     
     end.

     program CallCUDemo;
     
     uses CallCUnit;
     
     begin
       MyFoo := 42;
       Bar
     end.

   You can either link your program manually with `callc.o' or put a
compiler directive `{$L callc.o}' into your program or unit, and then
GPC takes care of correct linking. If you have the source of the C
library (you always have it if it is Free Software), you can even write
`{$L callc.c}' in the program (like above). Then GPC will also link
with `callc.o', but in addition GPC will run the C compiler whenever
`callc.c' has changed if `--automake' is given, too.

   While it is often convenient, there is no must to give the C
function `bar' the name `Bar' in Pascal; you can name it as you like
(e.g., the variable `MyFoo' has a C name of `foo' in the example above).

   If you omit the `name', the default is the Pascal identifier,
converted to lower-case. So, in this example, the `name' could be
omitted for `Bar', but not for `MyFoo'.

   It is important that data types of both languages are mapped
correctly onto each other. C's `int', for instance, translates to GPC's
`Integer', and C's `unsigned long' to `MedCard'. For a complete list of
integer types with their C counterparts, see *Note Integer Types::.

   In some cases it can be reasonable to translate a C pointer
parameter to a Pascal `var' parameter.  Since const parameters in GPC
can be passed by value _or_ by reference internally, possibly depending
on the system, `const foo *' parameters to C functions _cannot_
reliably be declared as `const' in Pascal. However, Extended Pascal's
`protected var' can be used since this guarantees passing by reference.

   Some libraries provide a `main' function and require your program's
"main" to be named differently. To achive this with GPC, invoke it with
an option `--gpc-main="GPCmain"' (where `GPCmain' is an example how you
might want to name the program). You can also write it into your source
as a directive `{$gpc-main="GPCmain"}'.

Exporting GPC Libraries to Other Languages
------------------------------------------

   The `.o' files produced by GPC are in the same format as those of all
other GNU compilers, so there is no problem in writing libraries for
other languages in Pascal. To use them, you will need to write kind of
interface - a header file in C. However there are some things to take
into account, especially if your Pascal unit exports objects:

   * By default, GPC capitalizes the first letter (only) of each
     identifier, so `procedure FooBAR' must be imported as `extern void
     Foobar()' from C.

   * If you want to specify the external name explicitly, use
     `attribute':

          procedure FooBAR; attribute (name = 'FooBAR');
          begin
            WriteLn ('FooBAR')
          end;

     This one can be imported from C with `extern void FooBar()'.

   * Objects are "records" internally.  They have an implicit `vmt'
     field which contains a pointer to the "virtual method table".
     This table is another record of the following structure:

          type
            VMT = record
              ObjectSize: PtrInt;     { Size of object in bytes }
              NegObjectSize: PtrInt;  { Negated size }
              Methods: array [1 .. n] of procedure;
                { Pointers to the virtual methods. The entries are of the
                   repective procedure or function types. }
            end;

     You can call a virtual method of an object from C if you explicitly
     declare this `struct' and explicitly dereference the `Fun' array.
     The VMT of an object `FooBAR' is an external (in C sense) variable
     `vmt_Foobar' internally.

   * Methods of objects are named `Myobject_Mymethod' (with exactly two
     capital letters) internally.

   * If you want to put a program in a library for some reason, and you
     want to give the `main' program an internal name different from
     `main', call GPC with the command-line option
     `--gpc-main="GPCmain"' (see the previous subsection).

Notes for Debugging
===================

   * The GNU debugger, `gdb', does not yet understand Pascal sets,
     files or subranges. Now `gdb' allows you to debug these things,
     even though it does not yet understand some stabs.

   * Forward referencing pointers generate debug info that appears as
     generic pointers.

   * No information of `with' statements is currently given to the
     debugger.

   * When debugging, please note that the Initial Letter In Each
     Identifier Is In Upper Case And The Rest Are In Lower Case, unless
     explicitly overriden with `name' (*note name::). This is to reduce
     name clashes with libc and other possible libraries.

   * All visible GPC Run Time System routines have linker names starting
     with `_p_'.

   * The linker name of the main program is `pascal_main_program'.
     This is done because ISO Standard wants to have the program name in
     a separate name space.

@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support

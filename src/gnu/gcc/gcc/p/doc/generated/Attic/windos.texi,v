@@{ Mostly BP compatible portable WinDos unit

  This unit supports most, but not all, of the routines and
  declarations of BP's WinDos unit.

  Notes:

  - The procedures GetIntVec and SetIntVec are not supported since
    they make only sense for Dos real-mode programs (and GPC
    compiled programs do not run in real-mode, even on IA32 under
    Dos). The procedures Intr and MsDos are only supported under
    DJGPP if @@samp{__BP_UNPORTABLE_ROUTINES__} is defined (with the
    @@samp{-D__BP_UNPORTABLE_ROUTINES__} option). A few other routines are
    also only supported with this define, but on all platforms (but
    they are crude hacks, that's why they are not supported without
    this define).

  - The internal structure of file variables (TFileRec and TTextRec)
    is different in GPC. However, as far as TFDDs are concerned,
    there are other ways to achieve the same in GPC, see the GPC
    unit.

@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

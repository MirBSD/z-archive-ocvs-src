*************************************

Jukka Virtanen
     invented GNU Pascal in March 1988, implemented the ISO 7185 and
     most of the ISO 10206 standard, etc.

     He created all files except those listed below, based on the GCC
     source.

Dr. Peter Gerwinski (http://www.gerwinski.de/~peter/)
     added Borland Pascal related and other extensions to GNU Pascal in
     summer 1995, ported GPC to EMX, does most of the development of the
     compiler since 1996, created and maintains the WWW home page,
     maintains the GNU Pascal mailing list, does some other
     administrative stuff, etc.

     He created `rts/move.pas', the files in `doc/' (together with
     Jan-Jaap), the (former) files in `config/emx/' and
     `gpc-nodes.def', and extensively modified all files.

Jan-Jaap van der Heijden
     ported GPC to DJGPP and to Microsoft Windows 95/NT, added ELF
     support in spring 1996, solved a lot of configuration and
     compatibility problems, created the GPC FAQ, etc.

     He created `Make-lang.in', `lang-options.h', `lang-specs.h', the
     files in `doc/' (together with Peter), `rts/Make*', and
     `rts/config*', and modified `module.c' and most other files.

Frank Heckenbach (http://fjf.gnu.de)
     rewrote and maintains the Run Time System since July 1997, does
     much development of the compiler since July 2001, wrote most of the
     units, demo programs, scripts and utilities distributed with GPC,
     wrote many test programs, maintains the GPC To-Do list etc.

     He created `gpc-options.h', most files in `units/', `demos/',
     `script/', `utils/' and `rts/' and many files in `test/', and
     modified most other files.

Prof. Abimbola A. Olowofoyeku ("The African Chief") (http://www.bigfoot.com/~african_chief/)
     created the original versions of many BP compatibility units in May
     1997, contributed code to other units and the Run Time System,
     helped porting GPC and the units to Cygwin and mingw, wrote a
     number of test programs, contributed a Borland Delphi-compatible
     `SysUtils' unit (http://www.gnu-pascal.de/contrib/chief/), etc.

     He created `units/gpcutil.pas', parts of `units/system.pas' and
     `rts/filename.pas' and a number of files in `test/'.

Nick Burrett
     fixed some bugs and cleaned up GPC in May 1998, etc.

     He modified `expressions.c', `parse.y', `module.c' and some other
     files.

Matthias Klose
     integrated GPC into EGCS and Debian GNU/Linux in May 1998, improved
     the installation process, etc.

     He modified `Makefile*', the `configure' script and many other
     files.

Dominik Freche
     improved and extended the GPC manual in August - September 1999 and
     wrote conversion routines for Borland compatible 6 Byte floating
     point numbers in December 1999.

     He modified `doc/en/reference.texi', `doc/en/programming.texi',
     and `units/system.pas' and created some files in `test/'.

Alexey Volokhov
     improved the performance of GPC's module/unit support in June 1997.

     He extensively modified `module.c'.

Bill Currie
     implemented more Borland extensions into GPC in July 1997.

     He modified `parse.y', `statements.c', and `predef.c'.

Nicola Girardi
     wrote the GNU Pascal Coding Standards in November 2001, contributed
     a GPC unit (http://www.gnu-pascal.de/contrib/nicola/) for the
     `svgalib' graphics library for some platforms in February 2000,
     provided some portability enhancements to the RTS.

     He created `doc/en/gpcs.texi' and modified `rts/rts.c' and created
     some files in `test/'.

Eike Lange
     wrote an internationalization unit, translated the GNU Pascal
     Coding Standards into German and worked on the documentation.

     He created `units/intl.pas', `units/intlc.c', `doc/de/gpcs.texi'
     and `doc/en/copying-demo.texi' and modified `doc/en/gpcs.texi' and
     `doc/en/programming.texi'.

Francisco Javier Fernandez Serrador
     translated the GPC documentation into Spanish.

     He created all files in `doc/es/'.

   All authors listed above have assigned their copyright of past and
future changes of GNU Pascal to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

Mirsad Todorovac
     translated the GPC documentation into Croatian.

     He created all files in `doc/hr/'.

     He has assigned his copyright of past and future changes of the
     Croatian translation of the GNU Pascal documentation to the Free
     Software Foundation (FSF).

Russ Whitaker
     updated and maintains the GNU Pascal FAQ.

     He modified `doc/en/faq.texi'.

     He has assigned his copyright of past and future changes of the GNU
     Pascal FAQ to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

@Import an alpha version of GNU Pascal Compiler into the tree
(not to be connected to the build before the upgrade to gcc 3.3).

We couldn't use gpc 2.1 because it's too old and doesn't support
gcc 3.x at all.

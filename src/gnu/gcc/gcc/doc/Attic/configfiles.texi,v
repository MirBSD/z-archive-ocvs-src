@The MirOS project cannot contain non-free documentation,
just like it is with non-free software.

It has been decided on the debian-legal list that the GNU
Free Documentation License does not meet the DFSG (and OSD)
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are defined.
The MirOS project goals do not allow inclusion of such material
either, because the user is not allowed to modify or remove
parts of the documentation.

You can thank the Free Software Foundation USA that you got
a system C compiler without any documentation.

@@node Configuration Files
@@subsubsection Files Created by @@code{configure}

Here we spell out what files will be set up by @@file{configure} in the
@@file{gcc} directory.  Some other files are created as temporary files
in the configuration process, and are not used in the subsequent
build; these are not documented.

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
@@file{Makefile} is constructed from @@file{Makefile.in}, together with
the host and target fragments (@@pxref{Fragments, , Makefile
Fragments}) @@file{t-@@var{target}} and @@file{x-@@var{host}} from
@@file{config}, if any, and language Makefile fragments
@@file{@@var{language}/Make-lang.in}.
@@item
@@file{auto-host.h} contains information about the host machine
determined by @@file{configure}.  If the host machine is different from
the build machine, then @@file{auto-build.h} is also created,
containing such information about the build machine.
@@item
@@file{config.status} is a script that may be run to recreate the
current configuration.
@@item
@@file{configargs.h} is a header containing details of the arguments
passed to @@file{configure} to configure GCC, and of the thread model
used.
@@item
@@file{cstamp-h} is used as a timestamp.
@@item
@@file{fixinc/Makefile} is constructed from @@file{fixinc/Makefile.in}.
@@item
@@file{gccbug}, a script for reporting bugs in GCC, is constructed from
@@file{gccbug.in}.
@@item
@@file{intl/Makefile} is constructed from @@file{intl/Makefile.in}.
@@item
@@file{mklibgcc}, a shell script to create a Makefile to build libgcc,
is constructed from @@file{mklibgcc.in}.
@@item
If a language @@file{config-lang.in} file (@@pxref{Front End Config, ,
The Front End @@file{config-lang.in} File}) sets @@code{outputs}, then
the files listed in @@code{outputs} there are also generated.
@@end itemize

The following configuration headers are created from the Makefile,
using @@file{mkconfig.sh}, rather than directly by @@file{configure}.
@@file{config.h}, @@file{hconfig.h} and @@file{tconfig.h} all contain the
@@file{xm-@@var{machine}.h} header, if any, appropriate to the host,
build and target machines respectively, the configuration headers for
the target, and some definitions; for the host and build machines,
these include the autoconfigured headers generated by
@@file{configure}.  The other configuration headers are determined by
@@file{config.gcc}.  They also contain the typedefs for @@code{rtx},
@@code{rtvec} and @@code{tree}.

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
@@file{config.h}, for use in programs that run on the host machine.
@@item
@@file{hconfig.h}, for use in programs that run on the build machine.
@@item
@@file{tconfig.h}, for use in programs and libraries for the target
machine.
@@item
@@file{tm_p.h}, which includes the header @@file{@@var{machine}-protos.h}
that contains prototypes for functions in the target @@file{.c} file.
FIXME: why is such a separate header necessary?

We'll try it again. Not gcc 3.3 this time.

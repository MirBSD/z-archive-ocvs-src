@The MirOS project cannot contain non-free documentation,
just like it is with non-free software.

It has been decided on the debian-legal list that the GNU
Free Documentation License does not meet the DFSG (and OSD)
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are defined.
The MirOS project goals do not allow inclusion of such material
either, because the user is not allowed to modify or remove
parts of the documentation.

You can thank the Free Software Foundation USA that you got
a system C compiler without any documentation.

@@c Commented out until ObjC++ is part of GCC:
@@c @@itemx OBJCPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like @@env{PATH}, in which to look for header files.
The special character, @@code{PATH_SEPARATOR}, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.

@@env{CPATH} specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with @@option{-I}, but after any paths given with @@option{-I}
options on the command line.  The environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.

The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with @@option{-isystem}, but after any
paths given with @@option{-isystem} options on the command line.

@@ifset cppmanual
See also @@ref{Search Path}.
@@end ifset

@@item DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
@@anchor{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT}
@@cindex dependencies for make as output
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.

The value of @@env{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT} can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
@@samp{@@var{file} @@var{target}}, in which case the rules are written to
file @@var{file} using @@var{target} as the target name.

In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options @@option{-MM} and @@option{-MF}
@@ifset cppmanual
(@@pxref{Invocation}),
@@end ifset
@@ifclear cppmanual
(@@pxref{Preprocessor Options}),
@@end ifclear
with an optional @@option{-MT} switch too.

@@item SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES
@@cindex dependencies for make as output
This variable is the same as the environment variable
@@env{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT} (@@pxref{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT}), except that
system header files are not ignored, so it implies @@option{-M} rather
than @@option{-MM}.  However, the dependence on the main input file is
omitted.
@@ifset cppmanual
@@xref{Invocation}.

@@ifclear cppmanual

@The MirOS project cannot contain non-free documentation,
just like it is with non-free software.

It has been decided on the debian-legal list that the GNU
Free Documentation License does not meet the DFSG (and OSD)
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are defined.
The MirOS project goals do not allow inclusion of such material
either, because the user is not allowed to modify or remove
parts of the documentation.

You can thank the Free Software Foundation USA that you got
a system C compiler without any documentation.

/* Tru64 UNIX V5 has a 16 byte long double type and requires __X_FLOAT to be

/* In Tru64 UNIX V5.1, Compaq introduced a new assembler
   (/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/adu) which currently (versions between 3.04.29 and
   3.04.32) breaks mips-tfile.  Passing the undocumented -oldas flag reverts
   to using the old assembler (/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/as[01]).

   The V5.0 and V5.0A assemblers silently ignore -oldas, so it can be
   specified here.

   It is clearly not desirable to depend on this undocumented flag, and
   Compaq wants -oldas to go away soon, but until they have released a
   new adu that works with mips-tfile, this is the only option.

   In some versions of the DTK, the assembler driver invokes ld after
   assembly.  This has been fixed in current versions, but adding -c
   works as expected for all versions.  */

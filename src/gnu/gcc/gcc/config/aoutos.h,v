/* To use this file, make up a file with a name like:

	?????aout.h

   where ????? is replaced by the name of the basic hardware that you
   are targeting for.  Then, in the file ?????aout.h, put something
   like:

	#include "?????.h"
	#include "aoutos.h"

   followed by any really system-specific defines (or overrides of
   defines) which you find that you need.  Now, modify the configure
   or configure.in script to properly use the new ?????aout.h file
   when configuring for the system.  */

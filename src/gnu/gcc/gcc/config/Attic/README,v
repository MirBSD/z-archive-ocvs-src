1.2
log
@the first part of making a release (non-X)
* sync sets (for now)
* mention set sizes in INSTALL.i386
* install all files, but not more than wanted
* fix build time warnings
  (the mktemp in lpd is said to be safe)
* update docs a bit
* the eqn -> neqn move
* improved man page generation
* anoncvsbin removes tmp before making new symlink
* sendmail generated files are now in sendmail, and
  SKIPDIRS is checked before (asked for by Waldemar Brodkorb)
* more SKIPDIR checks, mostly for GNU stuff

@This directory contains machine-specific files for the GNU C compiler.
It has a subdirectory for each basic CPU type.
The only files in this directory itself
are some .h files that pertain to particular operating systems
and are used for more than one CPU type.

@F77 bites the dust (it's broken anyway)  <-- look, without s! :)
and gcc 3.6+ will have F95 or so...

  - distribution set lists
* fix gcc2 -femit-memmove
* document changes in manpages
* install cccp and gcc-local manpages from gnu/doc/
* install gcc3 /usr/libexec/cpp if HAS_GCC2=no
* fold gpcrts into gcc3 again, since utils are now external,
  and don't warn on installation any more
* fix calls to scripts

@* fix the build system
* fix and enable the GNU Pascal RTS and Utils
  -> gpc is now fully supported; Hello World works.
* merge OpenBSD-OpenSSH 3.8, bump patchlevel
* add fchroot(2) diff, From: Pedro Martelletto <pbastos@@rdc.puc-rio.br>
* add fchroot(2) man page from NetBSD and myself
* fix orders of manpage sections
* fix displaying of .Nx mdoc macro
* convert scripts requiring bash to ksh
* nuke a shutload of GNU make idiotisms
* add pregenerated manpages - help2man is just bloat
* increase shlib versions after fchroot addition
* adjust and unbreak mk.conf after recent changes
* fix boot system version number after CD boot changes
* understand why Makefile.bsd-wrapper is needed as filename. Finally.
* regenerate files after syscalls.master change
* fix RCS Id detection and generation while here
* remove unused archs while there
* use __RCSID() macro in ssh ifdef __MirBSD__
* build ssh with -Werror, too

Note: this is a pre-snapshot, pre-build commit. Nothing
of this has actually been tested.

Like I said, please wait for the snapshot. Though, the
snapshot doesn't have any more circumstances preventing
me from working towards a release and upload now.

log
@* nuke obsolete files and parts of files
* enable pascal frontend
* enable CPIO naming convention:
  sv4cpio = .cpio
  sv4crc  = .cpio
  sv4cpio gzipped = .ngz (newc/gz)
  svrcrc  gzipped = .cgz (crc/gz)
* all packages are .cgz, all sets are .ngz
* add hooks for gjc frontend
* add stubbed out gpc and gjc rts hooks in src/gnu/gcc/Makefile
* enable java frontend (with almost no changes; this is what I
  call a _really_ nice langspec-subdir... amazing)
* bump patchlevel for these changes
* better document some changes
* matthieu@@openbsd.org assured me we need no X piclibs any more
* improve comments
* export whole libz to XFree86 .a modules
* correct usage of languages when bootstrapping gcc
* fix MKC_PGCC when USE_GCC3=no (since USE_GCC3 is a post-#7
  thing, and ports/lang/egcs is not available for -current)
* install man- and texinfopages for gpc

most of this stuff is tested. however, I *strongly* recommend
to not update, but rather wait for the next snapshot.

Now missing:
* pascal RTS
* a port for libgjc (I won't like it in base, due to the
  _heavy_ overhead (jar, ffi, boehm-gc*cough*, ...), but
  since the compiler is there, it should be easy)
* test pascal (c, cp, f, objc, and ada are fine already)
* test gcov? (proto is fine, all right)
* documentation improvements
* quality tests and improvements
* more ~/.etc
* get the damn cvs conflict script right ;)

Next projects:
* update binutils
* sync with openbsd
* rewrite large parts of build system
* write boot loader
* rewrite install system

@since the gpc people (and others) state gcc 3.3 isn't production quality yet,
let's just play with gpc and the other funky stuff right now, even if that
means still no sparc-gcc3 in current.

also, NO_CXX and friends change from defined/undef'd to yes/no

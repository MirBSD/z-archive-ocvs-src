@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

Readme for the GNU Compiler Collection on MirOS
===============================================

Do you wonder where the documentation is?

Well, the Free Software Foundation USA has ensured we cannot
distribute the documentation enclosed with gcc 3.2.3 because
of licence issues.

The MirOS project goals forbid distributing code - this does
not exclude docs - which we can't modify. (The fsf-funding.7
file is not installed and makes an exception.)

The GNU Free Documentation License has been deemed non-free,
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are speci-
fied - this is, however, not the case with the documents in-
cluded, thus we have decided to delete them.

Update: even in the case neither front nor back cover texts,
nor invariant sections are specified, the GFDL is considered
non-free: http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html

If you don't like the fact, contact your local FSF represen-
tative, or the FSF Europe or USA.

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

1.1
log
@* fix the build system
* fix and enable the GNU Pascal RTS and Utils
  -> gpc is now fully supported; Hello World works.
* merge OpenBSD-OpenSSH 3.8, bump patchlevel
* add fchroot(2) diff, From: Pedro Martelletto <pbastos@@rdc.puc-rio.br>
* add fchroot(2) man page from NetBSD and myself
* fix orders of manpage sections
* fix displaying of .Nx mdoc macro
* convert scripts requiring bash to ksh
* nuke a shutload of GNU make idiotisms
* add pregenerated manpages - help2man is just bloat
* increase shlib versions after fchroot addition
* adjust and unbreak mk.conf after recent changes
* fix boot system version number after CD boot changes
* understand why Makefile.bsd-wrapper is needed as filename. Finally.
* regenerate files after syscalls.master change
* fix RCS Id detection and generation while here
* remove unused archs while there
* use __RCSID() macro in ssh ifdef __MirBSD__
* build ssh with -Werror, too

Note: this is a pre-snapshot, pre-build commit. Nothing
of this has actually been tested.

Like I said, please wait for the snapshot. Though, the
snapshot doesn't have any more circumstances preventing
me from working towards a release and upload now.

1.2
log
@* fix the build system
* fix and enable the GNU Pascal RTS and Utils
  -> gpc is now fully supported; Hello World works.
* merge OpenBSD-OpenSSH 3.8, bump patchlevel
* add fchroot(2) diff, From: Pedro Martelletto <pbastos@@rdc.puc-rio.br>
* add fchroot(2) man page from NetBSD and myself
* fix orders of manpage sections
* fix displaying of .Nx mdoc macro
* convert scripts requiring bash to ksh
* nuke a shutload of GNU make idiotisms
* add pregenerated manpages - help2man is just bloat
* increase shlib versions after fchroot addition
* adjust and unbreak mk.conf after recent changes
* fix boot system version number after CD boot changes
* understand why Makefile.bsd-wrapper is needed as filename. Finally.
* regenerate files after syscalls.master change
* fix RCS Id detection and generation while here
* remove unused archs while there
* use __RCSID() macro in ssh ifdef __MirBSD__
* build ssh with -Werror, too

Note: this is a pre-snapshot, pre-build commit. Nothing
of this has actually been tested.

Like I said, please wait for the snapshot. Though, the
snapshot doesn't have any more circumstances preventing
me from working towards a release and upload now.

1.1
log
@* nuke obsolete files and parts of files
* enable pascal frontend
* enable CPIO naming convention:
  sv4cpio = .cpio
  sv4crc  = .cpio
  sv4cpio gzipped = .ngz (newc/gz)
  svrcrc  gzipped = .cgz (crc/gz)
* all packages are .cgz, all sets are .ngz
* add hooks for gjc frontend
* add stubbed out gpc and gjc rts hooks in src/gnu/gcc/Makefile
* enable java frontend (with almost no changes; this is what I
  call a _really_ nice langspec-subdir... amazing)
* bump patchlevel for these changes
* better document some changes
* matthieu@@openbsd.org assured me we need no X piclibs any more
* improve comments
* export whole libz to XFree86 .a modules
* correct usage of languages when bootstrapping gcc
* fix MKC_PGCC when USE_GCC3=no (since USE_GCC3 is a post-#7
  thing, and ports/lang/egcs is not available for -current)
* install man- and texinfopages for gpc

most of this stuff is tested. however, I *strongly* recommend
to not update, but rather wait for the next snapshot.

Now missing:
* pascal RTS
* a port for libgjc (I won't like it in base, due to the
  _heavy_ overhead (jar, ffi, boehm-gc*cough*, ...), but
  since the compiler is there, it should be easy)
* test pascal (c, cp, f, objc, and ada are fine already)
* test gcov? (proto is fine, all right)
* documentation improvements
* quality tests and improvements
* more ~/.etc
* get the damn cvs conflict script right ;)

Next projects:
* update binutils
* sync with openbsd
* rewrite large parts of build system
* write boot loader
* rewrite install system

Readme for GNU software on MirOS
================================

This file covers the most frequently asked questions about
the GNU tools which are contributational part of the MirOS
base installation. It also does cover legal requirements.


Documentation
-------------

Do you wonder where the documentation is?

Well, the Free Software Foundation USA has ensured we cannot
distribute the documentation enclosed with gcc 3.4.2 because
of licence issues.

The MirOS project goals forbid distributing code - this does
not exclude docs - which we cannot modify.

The GNU Free Documentation License has been deemed non-free,
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are speci-
fied - this is, however, not the case with the documents in-
cluded, thus we have decided to delete them.

Update: even in the case neither front nor back cover texts,
nor invariant sections are specified, the GFDL is considered
non-free: http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html

If you don't like the fact, contact your local FSF represen-
tative, or the FSF Europe or USA.


Compromise
----------

gcc 3.4.3+ will be delivered as contributional code, not ne-
cessary to run the operating system; that's why, the lesser,
not-so-free standards of the FSF suffice.

There is a port available, containing the manual and texinfo
pages of GNU binutils which come with the base system (often
a slightly older version). The remaining GNU tools which are
delivered as part of MirOS base (not core) have got free do-
cumentation or have been patched appropriately (replaced one
file in CVS 1.12 with an older version).


Libraries under the GNU GPL without linking exception clause
------------------------------------------------------------

While building the base system, you will see weird-looking
messages, such as
objdump.o: Linking with libopcodes infects with the GNU General Public License!
objdump.o: Linking with libbfd infects with the GNU General Public License!
objdump.o: Linking with libiberty infects with the GNU General Public License!

We have tried to identify any potential source of GPL poisoning in the
MirOS source tree. If you should encounter an infection warning messa-
ge, this is informational - the actual licence virus only gets active,
if the final linked binary is redistributed.
If we should have missed to identify a GPLd library which is installed
during the release process, please contact us immediately.


The ChangeLog requirement of the GNU GPL
----------------------------------------

Our changelogs are CVS, and the old ones from GNU
are retrievable via CVS:

anoncvs access with ssh:
	CVSROOT=mirbsd-cvs@@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/cvs
	CVSROOT=mirbsd-cvs@@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/ocvs
	password: anoncvs (attention: server in USA)

	CVSROOT=anoncvs-mirbsd@@anoncvs.allbsd.org:/???
	Port: 2022
	empty password

anonymous rsync access:
	- via rsync protocol
	rsync://rsync.allbsd.org/mirbsd-cvs/
	- via SSH
	mirbsd-cvs@@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/cvs/
	mirbsd-cvs@@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/ocvs/
	password: anoncvs (attention: server in USA)

cvsweb access with http:
	https://MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org:8890/cvs.cgi/
	http://MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org/cvs.cgi/
	http://cvsweb.allbsd.org/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=mirbsd

access to files' changelogs from upstream:
	http://www.openbsd.org/
	http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html

Licence blurb
-------------
Every single GNU-licensed (GPL, LGPL, etc.) file in this directory
is covered by the licence in the lowest possible version that is
written in the file, and relicensing files taken from MirOS under
later versions of e.g. the GPL (when the original file is, say,
GPLv1'd) is prohibited. You may of course ask the MirOS development
team, which will decide on a case by case basis. For some projects,
we are trying to assign back the copyright to the FSF (for practical
reasons, ignoring political problems).

To remove GNU FDL licenced material we have been forced (see the above
blurb about documentation). This is a consensus that has been discussed
on the debian-legal mailing list. MirBSD, MirLinux (MirOS) strive to be
DFSG-free operating systems, with MirPorts being only a defined way to
locally add third-party packages (itself BSD-style licenced as well),
thus we took the consequence and removed GFDL-licenced documentation
from the installed base system and, where feasible, from the source.


Not a solution
--------------

I've made a port of GFDL documentation (older binutils); you can
find it at MirPorts books/gfdl-doc. This is definitively not a so-
lution which fits us, but convenient for the user - who still must
blame the FSF USA for his extra work requirement to read them.


Other particulars
-----------------

$OpenBSD: README,v 1.1 2001/08/18 13:12:57 espie Exp $

Some of the software in this subtree follows special rules.

Specifically, the FSF not only wants the GPL licence, but they
also insist that you assign your copyright to the FSF for anything
but trivial changes.

So:
- check the history of external code before importing it.
- be ready to arrange for copyright papers somewhat in advance if
you want to work on it (the FSF takes a few months to process these).

Otherwise, changes might not make it to the main distribution, and may
need some further maintenance over time, or risk getting lost.

Some internal changes are acceptable, but OpenBSD can't afford to maintain
a complete separate toolchain on its own.


Assigning copyright back to the FSF
-----------------------------------

The FSF demands this for accepting patches, and demands the agreement
be made under US law. Contributor retains his moral rights under European
"Droit d'Auteur" style law.

The following MirOS committers and contributors have standing
copyright assignments with the FSF:
- tg@@ (Thorsten Glaser)
	* all of src/gnu/
	* all of gcc/

Of the following persons related to MirOS/OpenBSD this is known, too:
- espie@@openbsd.org (Marc Espie)
- etoh@@openbsd.org (Hiroaki Etoh) - acceptance pending
- kettenis@@openbsd.org (Mark Kettenis) - pending

@the first part of making a release (non-X)
* sync sets (for now)
* mention set sizes in INSTALL.i386
* install all files, but not more than wanted
* fix build time warnings
  (the mktemp in lpd is said to be safe)
* update docs a bit
* the eqn -> neqn move
* improved man page generation
* anoncvsbin removes tmp before making new symlink
* sendmail generated files are now in sendmail, and
  SKIPDIRS is checked before (asked for by Waldemar Brodkorb)
* more SKIPDIR checks, mostly for GNU stuff

@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

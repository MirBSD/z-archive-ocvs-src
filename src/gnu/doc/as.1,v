log
@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

.SH DESCRIPTION
GNU \c
.B as\c
\& is really a family of assemblers.
If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
\c
.I pseudo-ops)\c
\& and assembler syntax.

For information on the syntax and pseudo-ops used by GNU \c
.B as\c
\&, see '\|\c
.B as\c
\|' entry in \c
.B info \c
(or the manual \c
.I
.I
Using as: The GNU Assembler\c
\&).

\c
.B as\c
\& is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
compiler \c
.B gcc\c
\& for use by the linker \c
.B ld\c
\&.  Nevertheless,
we've tried to make \c
.B as\c
\& assemble correctly everything that the native
assembler would.
This doesn't mean \c
.B as\c
\& always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

Each time you run \c
.B as\c
\& it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)

If \c
.B as\c
\& is given no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the \c
.B as\c
\& standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type \c
.B ctl-D\c
\& to tell \c
.B as\c
\& there is no more program
to assemble.  Use '\|\c
.B \-\^\-\c
\|' if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.

.B as\c
\& may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when \c
.B as\c
\& is
run automatically by a compiler.  Warnings report an assumption made so
that \c
.B as\c
\& could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
grave problem that stops the assembly.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a \||\| \-al \||\| \-as
Turn on assembly listings; '\|\c
.B \-al\c
\&\|', listing only, '\|\c
.B \-as\c
\&\|', symbols
only, '\|\c
.B \-a\c
\&\|', everything.
.TP
.B \-D
This option is accepted only for script compatibility with calls to
other assemblers; it has no effect on \c
.B as\c
\&.
.TP
.B \-f
"fast"--skip preprocessing (assume source is compiler output).
.TP
.BI "\-I\ " path
Add
.I path
to the search list for
.B .include
directives.
.TP
.B \-k
Handle position independent code, generated by gcc -fpic.
.TP
.B \-K
Handle position independent code, generated by gcc -fPIC.
This is currently handled identically to '\|\c
.B \-k\c
\&\|', on all architectures except the
.I ns32k\c
\&\.
.TP
.B \-L
Keep (in symbol table) local symbols, starting with '\|\c
.B L\c
\|'
.TP
.BI "\-o\ " objfile
Name the object-file output from \c
.B as
.TP
.B \-R
Fold data section into text section
.TP
.B \-v
Announce \c
.B as\c
\& version
.TP
.B \-W
Suppress warning messages
.TP
.IR "\-\^\-" "\ |\ " "files\|.\|.\|."
Source files to assemble, or standard input (\c
.BR "\-\^\-" ")"
.TP
.BI \-A var
.I
(When configured for Intel 960.)
Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.
.TP
.B \-b
.I
(When configured for Intel 960.)
Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.
.TP
.B \-norelax
.I
(When configured for Intel 960.)
Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long displacements;
error if necessary.
.TP
.B \-l
.I
(When configured for Motorola 68000).
.br
Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.
.TP
.BR "\-mc68000" "\||\|" "\-mc68010" "\||\|" "\-mc68020" "\||\|" "\-mc68030" "\||\|" "\-mc68040" "\||\|" "\-mc68060"
.I
(When configured for Motorola 68000).
.br
Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target (default 68020)

.PP
Options may be in any order, and may be
before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

'\|\c
.B \-\^\-\c
\|' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for \c
.B as\c
\& to assemble.

Except for '\|\c
.B \-\^\-\c
\|' any command line argument that begins with a
hyphen ('\|\c
.B \-\c
\|') is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of
\c
.B as\c
\&.  No option changes the way another option works.  An
option is a '\|\c
.B \-\c
\|' followed by one or more letters; the case of
the letter is important.   All options are optional.

The '\|\c
.B \-o\c
\|' option expects exactly one file name to follow.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).

These two command lines are equivalent:
.br
.B
as\ \ \-o\ \ my\-object\-file.o\ \ mumble.s
.br
.B
as\ \ \-omy\-object\-file.o\ \ mumble.s

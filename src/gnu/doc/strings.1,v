.Sh NAME
.Nm strings
.Nd find printable strings in a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm strings
.Op Fl afo
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl m Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar radix
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh WARNING
This file describes
.Nm
for the
.Xr a.out 5
format, which is not being used in current versions of
.Mx .
We cannot provide you with the current and (more or less, that is)
accurare documentation that comes with GNU binutils.
If you are interested as to why, please refer to
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/README.GNU .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the sequences of printable characters in each of the specified
files, or in the standard input, by default.
By default, a sequence must be at least four characters in length
before being displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
By default,
.Nm
only searches the text and data segments of object files.
The
.Fl a
option causes
.Nm
to search the entire object file.
.It Fl f
Each string is preceded by the name of the file
in which it was found.
.It Fl n Ar number
Specifies the minimum number of characters in a sequence to be
.Ar number ,
instead of four.
.It Fl m Ar number
Specifies the maximum number of characters in a sequence to be
.Ar number ,
instead of unlimited.
.It Fl o
Each string is preceded by its octal offset in the file.
.It Fl t Ar radix
Each string is preceded by its offset in the file.
The first character of
.Ar radix
determines the radix of the offset:
.Sq o
for octal;
.Sq d
for decimal; or
.Sq x
for hexadecimal.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is useful for identifying random binaries, among other things.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hexdump 1 ,
.Xr od 1
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historic implementations of
.Nm
only search the initialized data portion of the object file.
This was reasonable as strings were normally stored there.
Given new compiler technology which installs strings in the
text portion of the object file, the default behavior was
changed.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primitive.
In particular, machine code instructions on certain architectures
can resemble sequences of ASCII bytes, which
will fool the algorithm.

.SH NAME
sdiff \- find differences between two files and merge interactively
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sdiff
.B -o
outfile [options] from-file to-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I sdiff
command merges two files and interactively outputs the
results to
.IR outfile .

If
.I from-file
is a directory and
.I to-file
is not,
.I sdiff
compares the file in
.I from-file
whose file name is that of
.IR to-file ,
and vice versa.
.I from-file
and
.I to-file
may not both be
directories.

.I sdiff
options begin with
.BR \- ,
so normally
.I from-file
and
.I to-file
may not begin with
.BR \- .
However,
.B \-\-
as an
argument by itself treats the remaining arguments as file names even if
they begin with
.BR \- .
You may not use
.B \-
as an input file.

.I sdiff
without
.B \-o
(or
.BR \-\-output )
produces a
side-by-side difference.  This usage is obsolete; use
.B "diff \-\-side\-by\-side"
instead.
.SS Options
Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU
.I sdiff
accepts.
Each option has two equivalent names, one of which is a single
letter preceded by
.BR \- ,
and the other of which is a long name
preceded by
.BR \-\- .
Multiple single letter options (unless they take
an argument) can be combined into a single command line argument.  Long
named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
.TP
.B \-a
Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
do not appear to be text.
.TP
.B \-b
Ignore changes in amount of white space.
.TP
.B \-B
Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.
.TP
.B \-d
Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This
makes
.I sdiff
slower (sometimes much slower).
.TP
.B \-H
Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous
scattered small changes.
.TP
.B \-\-expand\-tabs
Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
in the input files.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.
.TP
.BI "\-I " regexp
Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match
.IR regexp .
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-all\-space
Ignore white space when comparing lines.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-blank\-lines
Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-case
Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.
.TP
.BI \-\-ignore\-matching\-lines= regexp
Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match
.IR regexp .
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-space\-change
Ignore changes in amount of white space.
.TP
.B \-l
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-\-left\-column
Print only the left column of two common lines.
.TP
.B \-\-minimal
Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This
makes
.I sdiff
slower (sometimes much slower).
.TP
.BI "\-o " file
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-output= file
Put merged output into
.IR file .
This option is required for merging.
.TP
.B \-s
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-\-suppress\-common\-lines
Do not print common lines.
.TP
.B \-\-speed\-large\-files
Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous
scattered small changes.
.TP
.B \-t
Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
in the input files.
.TP
.B \-\-text
Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
do not appear to be text.
.TP
.B \-v
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-\-version
Output the version number of
.IR sdiff .
.TP
.BI "\-w " columns
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-width= columns
Use an output width of
.IR columns .
Note that for historical reasons, this option is
.B \-W
in
.IR diff ,
.B \-w
in
.IR sdiff .
.TP
.B \-W
Ignore horizontal white space when comparing lines.
Note that for historical reasons, this option is
.B \-w
in
.IR diff ,
.B \-W
in
.IR sdiff .
.SH SEE ALSO
cmp(1), comm(1), diff(1), diff3(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
differences were found, and 2 means trouble.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

@1999-12-21  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@@gnu.org>

	* grohtml.man: Fixed copyright year.

1999-12-15  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Some other fixes.

1999-12-13  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc (main): Added new option `-x' to help debugging tables.

1999-12-11  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* html.cc: Fixed image position bugs.  However, three major bugs
	remain: Firstly, grohtml sometimes miscalculates the end of an
	html table resulting in text which appears twice.  Secondly,
	equation numbers are not handled correctly.  Thirdly, equation
	macros and pic macros can confuse grohtml; this can be seen by
	nested `graphic-start's -- I believe the best method to solve this
	is to detect .EQ, .EN, .TS, .TE, .PS, .PE sequences in troff and
	add the graphic-start special character at this point.

	* grohtml.man: Minor fixes.
	
1999-11-29  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* design.ms: More updates; added some basic introductional
	information.

	* html.cc: Fixed more bugs mainly in the table handling code.
	Making the code terminate a table at the correct position.
	Indented .IPs appear to work now.  Region ends also correctly
	terminate tables.

1999-11-16  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* design.ms, grohtml.man: Updated.

	* html.cc, ordered_list.h: Fixed many bugs in the table handling
	code.  Reverted the -t switch so that table handling code is used
	by default and users must turn it off with -t.

	Manual page generation using `groff -Thtml -man' is much better
	due in large part to the table code and minor alterations in
	tmac.an.

1999-10-30  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* implemented auto formatting and introduced html table
	code. Fixed several text handling bugs and grohtml will
	detect centered lines - an offshoot of the html table code.

	* reverted meaning of grohtml's `-a' switch: using -a means that
	output will be preformatted.

1999-10-05  Gaius Mulley  <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* Introduced command line options -r to determine the resolution
	of generated images, -I to determine the format of images
	generated.

	* Fixed many bugs to do with superscripts, subscripts,
	indentation, font changes, and extraneous spaces.

	* Fixed bug in determining the range of polygons and splines.

	* Updated the manual page to reflect the new options.

	* The default image type is png format, however this will only
	work if you have a gs with a png output device.  If you don't have
	a gs with this ability you can either reconfigure html to generate
	gif images by default (alter a #define in html.cc).  Or
	alternatively you can use the -Igif option.

1999-09-27  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@@gnu.org>

	* html.cc (move_horizontal): Fonts have changed one character too
	late.
	
1999-09-26  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@@gnu.org>

	* grohtml.man: Minor cosmetic fixes.

1999-09-25  Gaius Mulley <gaius@@glam.ac.uk>

	* grohtml.man, html.cc: Rewrite of the html text component.  Basic
	font faces supported together with font types.  Superscript and
	subscript have also been implemented.  Temporarily removed the
	-P-a switch on grohtml as it is not working (never worked).  This
	is the next `to do'.  Added a simple macro tmac.arkup which
	contains simple html features.  This macro needs further work.
	Arc, spline, polygon fill have all been added and arc max/min xy
	limits are calculated, the same needs to be done for spline.  Many
	bugs have been fixed regarding basic html text.

	* design.ms: New file describing how html.cc works.

Aug 1999

	Initial release, very basic html text generated, quite ugly text
	is generated according to many reports :-) Equations, tables,
	pictures generate gif files via gs and ppmquant, ppmtogif, grops.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

.TH GROHTML @@MAN1EXT@@ "@@MDATE@@" "Groff Version @@VERSION@@"
.SH NAME
grohtml \- html driver for groff
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grohtml
[
.B \-atvdgm?
] [
.BI \-F dir
] [
.BI \-I imagetype
] [
.BI \-r resolution
] [
.IR files \|.\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B grohtml
translates the output of GNU
.B troff
to html.
Normally
.B grohtml
should be invoked by using the groff command with a
.B \-Thtml
option.
If no files are given,
.B grohtml
will read the standard input.
A filename of
.B \-
will also cause
.B grohtml
to read the standard input.
Html output is written to the standard output.
When
.B grohtml
is run by
.B groff
options can be passed to
.B grohtml
using the
.B groff
.B \-P
option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
force
.B grohtml
to generate html line breaks in the same position as troff dictates.
Without this option
.B grohtml
generates text in paragraphs which is formatted by the html browser.
.TP
.B \-d
turn on internal debugging.
.TP
.B \-g
tell
.B grohtml
not to try and guess titles and headings.
By using this flag together with the -m and -a flag
.B grohtml
will treat the html browser as a printer, not as a formatter.
.TP
.B \-m
leave margins alone.
.B grohtml
will not remove left margins.
.TP
.B \-t
forbids
.B grohtml
from generating html tables when implementing indentation and tabular text.
.B grohtml
can implement .IP by tables or html indents.
However if .2C is used it can only be sensibly converted to html using a
table structure.
As a few known bugs still exist with the html table code this option is
present to supress execution of this development code.
The default in
.B grohtml
is that html tables are generated when appropriate.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Search the directory
.IB dir /dev name
for font and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR html .
.TP
.BI \-I imagetype
select the type of image generated when grohtml encounters an equation,
table, or picture.
By default this is png256.
Legal image types are: gif and any of the png formats which are supported by
ghostscript gs(1).
.TP
.BI \-r resolution
select the resolution for all images.
By default this is 80 pixels per inch.
Example: -r100 indicates 100 pixels per inch.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.TP
.B \-?
Display usage.
.SH USAGE
There are styles called
.BR R ,
.BR I ,
.BR B ,
and
.B BI
mounted at font positions 1 to 4.
It is advisable to invoke groff with the -mhtml macro set, which turns off
headers, footers, and hyphenation; additionally, it will right justify text.
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.B grohtml
is dependent upon grops and gs.
If
.B grohtml
has been configured to generate gif files then it is further dependent upon,
ppmtogif, and ppmquant.
However if it has been configured to generate png files (the default) then
it is dependent upon gs having a png output device.
Images are generated whenever a table, picture, equation or line is
encountered.
.SH BUGS
This is still very alpha.
At least three major bugs remain:
Firstly,
.B grohtml
sometimes miscalculates the end of an html table resulting in text which
appears twice.
Secondly equation numbers are not handled correctly.
Thirdly equation macros and pic macros can confuse
.BR grohtml .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

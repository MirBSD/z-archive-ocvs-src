@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

.SH DESCRIPTION
@@g@@lookbib prints a prompt on the standard error (unless the standard input is not a terminal),
reads from the standard input a line containing a set of keywords,
searches the bibliographic databases
.IR filename \|.\|.\|.
for references containing those keywords,
prints any references found on the standard output,
and repeats this process until the end of input.
For each database

created by

each index can cover multiple databases.

When searching files for which no index exists,
ignore the contents of fields whose names are in

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

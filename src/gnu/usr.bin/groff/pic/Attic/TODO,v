@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

@Dotted and dashed ellipses.

In troff mode, dotted and dashed splines.

Make DELIMITED have type lstr; this would allow us to give better
error messages for problems within the body of for and if constructs.

In troff mode without -x, fake \D't' with .ps commands.

Perhaps an option to set command char.

Add an output class for dumb line printers. It wouldn't be pretty but
it would be better than nothing. Integrate it with texinfo.  Useful
for groff -Tascii as well.

Option to allow better positioning of arrowheads on arcs.

Perhaps add PostScript output mode.

Change the interface to the output class so that output devices have
the opportunity to handle arrowheads themselves.

Consider whether the line thickness should scale.

Consider whether the test in a for loop should be fuzzy (as it
apparently is in grap).

Possibly change fillval so that zero is black.

Provide a way of getting text blocks (positioned with `.in' rather
than \h), into pic.  Should be possible to use block of diverted text
in pic.  Possibly something similar to T{ and T} in tbl.

Option to provide macro backtraces.

Have a path that is searched by `copy' statement.  Set by environment
variable or command line option.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

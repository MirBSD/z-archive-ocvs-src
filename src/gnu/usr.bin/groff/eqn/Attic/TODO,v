@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

@Use the same size increases for sum prod int as eqn does.

Perhaps chartype should be renamed.

TeX makes {sub,super}script on a single character with an accent
into an accent onto the (character with the script). Should we do this?

Implement mark and lineups within scripts, matrices and piles, and accents.
(Why would this be useful?)

Perhaps push hmotions down through lists to avoid upsetting spacing
adjustments.

Possibly generate .lf commands during compute_metrics phase.

Consider whether there should be extra space at the side of piles.

Provide scriptstyle displaystyle etc.

Provide a nicer matrix syntax, eg
matrix ccc {
a then b then c above
e then f then g above
h then i then k
}

Perhaps generate syntax error messages using the style of gpic.

Wide accents.

More use of \Z.

Extensible square roots.

Vphantom

Smash.

Provide a variant of vec that extends over the length of the accentee.

Support vertical arrow delimiters.

Make the following work:
.EQ

.EN
.EQ @@<-@@
some equation

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

Initially
.I n
is 6.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B grolj4
is a driver for
.B groff
that produces output in PCL5 format suitable for an HP Laserjet 4 printer.
.LP
There is an additional drawing command available:
.TP
.BI \eD'R\  dh\ dv '
Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner
at the current position, and the diagonally opposite corner
at the current position 
.RI +( dh , dv ).
Afterwards the current position will be at the opposite corner.  This
generates a PCL fill rectangle command, and so will work on
printers that do not support HPGL/2 unlike the other
.B \eD
commands.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c n
Print
.I n
copies of each page.
.TP
.B \-l
Print the document with a landscape orientation.
.TP
.BI "\-d [" n ]
Use duplex mode 
.IR n :
1\ is long-side binding; 2\ is short-side binding;
default is\ 1.
.TP
.BI \-p size
Set the paper size to
.IR size ,
which must be one of
letter, legal, executive, a4, com10, monarch, c5, b5, dl.
.TP
.B \-v

.TP
.BI \-w n

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

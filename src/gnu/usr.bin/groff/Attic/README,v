@remove GNU groff - tree cleanup
we don't really need it; unix nroff fits us well enough, and for
the pre-formatted man pages, we can simply grab them from openbsd

someone wanna make a port?
@
text
@This is the GNU groff document formatting system.  The version number
is given in the file VERSION.

Included in this release are implementations of troff, pic, eqn, tbl,
refer, the -man macros and the -ms macros, and drivers for PostScript,
TeX dvi format, HP LaserJet 4 printers, HTML format (still alpha), and
typewriter-like devices.  Also included is a modified version of the
Berkeley -me macros, an enhanced version of the X11 xditview
previewer, and an implementation of the -mm macros contributed by
Joergen Haegg (jh@@axis.se).

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.  You will require
a C++ compiler.

The file NEWS describes recent user-visible changes to groff.

Groff is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying permission.

The file PROBLEMS describes various problems that have been
encountered in compiling, installing, and running groff.

For the moment, the documentation assumes that you are already
familiar with the Unix versions of troff, -man, -ms and the
preprocessors.

The most recent released version of groff is always available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.gnu.org in the directory pub/gnu/groff.

A CVS repository is now available, containing the current development
version of groff.  You can access it with the commands

  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@@anoncvs.ffii.org:/var/cvs
  cvs login
  cvs -z9 co groff

(if the prompt for the password appears, just press the enter key).
After a successful login you no longer need the first two commands; an
update of a checked out repository should be done with

  cvs -z9 update -d

Please read the info pages of cvs for further details.

Alternatively, you can download snapshots (which are updated twice a
day) from

  ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/groff/devel/groff-current.tar.gz

or a diff file relative to the latest official groff release as

  ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/groff/devel/groff-<version>-current.diff.gz

Please report bugs using the form in the file BUG-REPORT; the idea of
this is to make sure that FSF has all the information it needs to fix
the bug.  At the very least, read the BUG-REPORT form and make sure
that you supply all the information that it asks for.  Even if you are
not sure that something is a bug, report it using BUG-REPORT: this
will enable us to determine whether it really is a bug or not.

Three mailing lists are available:

  bug-groff@@gnu.org          for reporting bugs
  groff@@gnu.org              for general discussion of groff
  groff-commit@@ffii.org      a read-only list showing logs of
                             commitments to the CVS repository

Note that groff@@gnu.org is an alias for groff@@ffii.org; you must be
subscribed to the `groff' and `groff-commit' lists to send mails.

To subscribe, send a mail to <list>-request@@<domain> (example:
groff-request@@ffii.org) with the word `subscribe' in either the
subject or body of the email (don't include the quotes).

GNU groff was written by James Clark <jjc@@jclark.com>.  It is now
maintained by Ted Harding <ted.harding@@nessie.mcc.ac.uk> and Werner
Lemberg <wl@@gnu.org>.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH DESCRIPTION
GNU \c
.B as\c
\& is really a family of assemblers.  
If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
\c
.I pseudo-ops)\c
\& and assembler syntax.  

For information on the syntax and pseudo-ops used by GNU \c
.B as\c
\&, see `\|\c
.B as\c
\|' entry in \c
.B info \c
(or the manual \c
.I
.I
Using as: The GNU Assembler\c
\&).

\c
.B as\c
\& is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
compiler \c
.B gcc\c
\& for use by the linker \c
.B ld\c
\&.  Nevertheless,
we've tried to make \c
.B as\c
\& assemble correctly everything that the native
assembler would.
This doesn't mean \c
.B as\c
\& always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

Each time you run \c
.B as\c
\& it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)

If \c
.B as\c
\& is given no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the \c
.B as\c
\& standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type \c
.B ctl-D\c
\& to tell \c
.B as\c
\& there is no more program
to assemble.  Use `\|\c
.B \-\^\-\c
\|' if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.

.B as\c
\& may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when \c
.B as\c
\& is
run automatically by a compiler.  Warnings report an assumption made so
that \c
.B as\c
\& could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
grave problem that stops the assembly.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a \||\| \-al \||\| \-as
Turn on assembly listings; `\|\c
.B \-al\c
\&\|', listing only, `\|\c
.B \-as\c
\&\|', symbols
only, `\|\c
.B \-a\c
\&\|', everything.
.TP
.B \-D
This option is accepted only for script compatibility with calls to
other assemblers; it has no effect on \c
.B as\c
\&.
.TP
.B \-f
``fast''--skip preprocessing (assume source is compiler output).
.TP
.BI "\-I\ " path
Add 
.I path
to the search list for 
.B .include
directives.
.TP
.B \-k
Handle position independent code, generated by gcc -fpic.
.TP
.B \-K
Handle position independent code, generated by gcc -fPIC.
This is currently handled identically to `\|\c
.B \-k\c
\&\|', on all architectures except the
.I ns32k\c
\&\.
.TP
.B \-L
Keep (in symbol table) local symbols, starting with `\|\c
.B L\c
\|'
.TP
.BI "\-o\ " objfile
Name the object-file output from \c
.B as
.TP
.B \-R
Fold data section into text section
.TP
.B \-v
Announce \c
.B as\c
\& version
.TP
.B \-W
Suppress warning messages
.TP
.IR "\-\^\-" "\ |\ " "files\|.\|.\|."
Source files to assemble, or standard input (\c
.BR "\-\^\-" ")"
.TP
.BI \-A var
.I
(When configured for Intel 960.)
Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.
.TP
.B \-b
.I
(When configured for Intel 960.)
Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.
.TP
.B \-norelax
.I
(When configured for Intel 960.)
Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long displacements;
error if necessary.
.TP
.B \-l
.I
(When configured for Motorola 68000).  
.br
Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.
.TP
.BR "\-mc68000" "\||\|" "\-mc68010" "\||\|" "\-mc68020" "\||\|" "\-mc68030" "\||\|" "\-mc68040" "\||\|" "\-mc68060"
.I
(When configured for Motorola 68000).  
.br
Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target (default 68020)

.PP
Options may be in any order, and may be
before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

`\|\c
.B \-\^\-\c
\|' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for \c
.B as\c
\& to assemble.

Except for `\|\c
.B \-\^\-\c
\|' any command line argument that begins with a
hyphen (`\|\c
.B \-\c
\|') is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of
\c
.B as\c
\&.  No option changes the way another option works.  An
option is a `\|\c
.B \-\c
\|' followed by one or more letters; the case of
the letter is important.   All options are optional.

The `\|\c
.B \-o\c
\|' option expects exactly one file name to follow.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).  

These two command lines are equivalent:
.br
.B
as\ \ \-o\ \ my\-object\-file.o\ \ mumble.s
.br
.B
as\ \ \-omy\-object\-file.o\ \ mumble.s

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove old binutils as well; i386 is our single target,

@A few short notes on PIC support.

. References to the symbol "_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_" are special. These always
  PC relative to the start of the current instruction. Also, they occur
  in "complex" expressions in function prologs, eg.

	move	_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ + (. - L1 ), %some_register

  The expression parser can't handle these generically, so the expression
  above is recognised as a special case.

. Some archs have special PIC assembler syntax to reference static and global
  data. This is handled in targ-cpu.c.

. Correct relocation_info must be output (eg. fields r_jmptable and r_baserel).

. Internal labels must be output in the symbol table if they are referred to
  by PIC instructions. The linker must allocate a GOT slot for them.
 
. The former meaning of the -k switch ("WORKING_DOT" stuff), has been nuked
  in favour of enabling PIC code recognition.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

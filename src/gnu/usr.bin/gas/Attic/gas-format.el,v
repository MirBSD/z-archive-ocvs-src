@remove old binutils as well; i386 is our single target,
and it's ELF; x86-64 will be ELF as well (I hope).

;; originally from...
;;	Rich's personal .emacs file.  feel free to copy.
;;
;; this file sets emacs up for the type of C source code formatting used within
;; gas.  I don't use gnu indent.  If you do, and find a setup that approximates
;; these settings, please send it to me.

;;
;;
;;	This section sets constants used by c-mode for formating
;;
;;


;;  If `c-auto-newline' is non-`nil', newlines are inserted both
;;before and after braces that you insert, and after colons and semicolons.
;;Correct C indentation is done on all the lines that are made this way.

(setq c-auto-newline nil)


;;  If `c-tab-always-indent' is non-`nil', the TAB command
;;in C mode does indentation only if point is at the left margin or within
;;the line's indentation.  If there is non-whitespace to the left of point,
;;then TAB just inserts a tab character in the buffer.  Normally,
;;this variable is `nil', and TAB always reindents the current line.

(setq c-tab-always-indent nil)

;;  C does not have anything analogous to particular function names for which
;;special forms of indentation are desirable.  However, it has a different
;;need for customization facilities: many different styles of C indentation
;;are in common use.
;;
;;  There are six variables you can set to control the style that Emacs C
;;mode will use.
;;
;;`c-indent-level'     
;;     Indentation of C statements within surrounding block.  The surrounding
;;     block's indentation is the indentation of the line on which the
;;     open-brace appears.

(setq c-indent-level 8)

;;`c-continued-statement-offset'     
;;     Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the then-clause of
;;     an if or body of a while.

(setq c-continued-statement-offset 4)

;;`c-brace-offset'     
;;     Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.

(setq c-brace-offset 0)

;;`c-brace-imaginary-offset'     
;;     An open brace following other text is treated as if it were this far
;;     to the right of the start of its line.

(setq c-brace-imaginary-offset 0)

;;`c-argdecl-indent'     
;;     Indentation level of declarations of C function arguments.

(setq c-argdecl-indent 0)

;;`c-label-offset'     
;;     Extra indentation for line that is a label, or case or default.

(setq c-label-offset -8)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove old binutils as well; i386 is our single target,
and it's ELF; x86-64 will be ELF as well (I hope).

/*"input_file.c":Operating-system dependant functions to read source files.*/

/*
 * No matter what the operating system, this module must provide the
 * following services to its callers.
 *
 * input_file_begin()			Call once before anything else.
 *
 * input_file_end()			Call once after everything else.
 *
 * input_file_buffer_size()		Call anytime. Returns largest possible
 *					delivery from
 *					input_file_give_next_buffer().
 *
 * input_file_open(name)		Call once for each input file.
 *
 * input_file_give_next_buffer(where)	Call once to get each new buffer.
 *					Return 0: no more chars left in file,
 *					   the file has already been closed.
 *					Otherwise: return a pointer to just
 *					   after the last character we read
 *					   into the buffer.
 *					If we can only read 0 characters, then
 *					end-of-file is faked.
 *
 * input_file_push()			Push state, which can be restored
 *					later.  Does implicit input_file_begin.
 *					Returns char * to saved state.
 *
 * input_file_pop (arg)			Pops previously saved state.
 *
 * input_file_close ()			Closes opened file.
 *
 * All errors are reported (using as_perror) so caller doesn't have to think
 * about I/O errors. No I/O errors are fatal: an end-of-file may be faked.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

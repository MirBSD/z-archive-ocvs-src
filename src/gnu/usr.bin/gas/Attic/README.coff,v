@remove old binutils as well; i386 is our single target,
and it's ELF; x86-64 will be ELF as well (I hope).

@The coff patches intend to do the following :

   . Generate coff files very compatible with vanilla linker.
   . Understands coff debug directives.

Here are the guidelines of the work I have done :

   . Encapsulate format dependent code in macros where it is possible.
   . Where not possible differenciate with #ifdef
   . try not to change the calling conventions of the existing functions. 
	I made one exception : symbol_new. I would be pleased to hear about
	a better solution. (symbols.c)
   . Extend the use of N_TYPE_seg seg_N_TYPE tables so that segments can
	be manipulated without using their format dependent name. (subsegs.c)
   . Write a function to parse the .def debug directives
   . Write two small peaces of code to handle the .ln directive.
   . In write.c try to move all the cross compilation specifics (md_..) to
     format dependent files.
   . Encapsulate the data structures using generic types, macros calls.
   . Added too much code to resolve the complexity of the symbol table
     generated. Most of the code deals with debug stuff.
   . Create another makefile, shorter, cleaner.
   . Create a config.gas shell script to mimic the gcc,gdb... configuration
	mechanism. This reduce the complexity of the makefile.
   . Isolate the format dependent code in two files 
	coff.c coff.h
	aout.c aout.h
	elf.c elf.h    [ Not yet ;-]
   . added a little stack management routine for coff in file stack.c
   . isolate os specific flags in m- files

If further development is planed on it is should solve the following problems :

   . Encapsulate DESC & OTHER tests in a macro call. I'm not aware
	of their exact semantics.
   . Clean up the seg_N_TYPE N_TYPE_seg naming scheme
   . Try to remove as much reference to segment dependent names as possible
   . Find a cleaner solution for symbol_new.
   . Report the modifications on vax, ns32k, sparc machine dependent files.
	To acheive this goal, search for \<N_, sy_, symbol_new and symbolS.
   . Allow an arbitrary number of segments (spare sections .ctor .dtor .bletch)
   . Find a way to extend the debug information without breaking sdb
     compatibility. Mainly intended for G++.
   . should it do something to generate shared libraries objects ?

I have tested this code on the following processor/os. gcc-1.37.1 was
   used for all the tests.

386	SCO unix ODT
	gcc-1.37.1, gas, emacs-18.55

386	Esix rev C
	gas-1.37/write.s

386	Ix 2.02
	gas, all the X11R4 mit clients

386	CTIX 3.2
	xsol (X11R4 solitary game), gas

68030	unisoft 1.3	
	the kernel (V.3.2) + tcp/ip extensions
	bash-1.05, bison-1.11, compress-4.0, cproto, shar-3.49, diff-1.14,
	dist-18.55, flex-2.3, gas-1.37, gcc-1.37.1, gdb-3.6, grep-1.5,
	kermit, make-3.58, makedep, patch, printf, makeinfo, g++-1.37.1,
	tar-1.08, texi2roff, uuencode, uutraf-1.2, libg++-1.37.2, groff-0.5

68020	sunos 3.5 (no, not coff, just to be sure that I didn't
			introduce errors)
	gcc-1.37.1, gas, emacs-18.55, gdb-3.6, bison-1.11, diff-1.14, 
	make-3.58, tar-1.08

68030   sunos 4.0.3 (idem)
	gas

I would be glad to hear about new experiences

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

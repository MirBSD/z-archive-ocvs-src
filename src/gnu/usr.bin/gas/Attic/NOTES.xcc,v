@remove old binutils as well; i386 is our single target,
and it's ELF; x86-64 will be ELF as well (I hope).

Notes for creating Cross-Assemblers on NetBSD
=============================================

If your build host runs NetBSD, it is relatively painless to create a
cross-assembler in this directory.

To create a cross-assembler:
1.	Set the environment variable ``TARGET_MACHINE_ARCH'' to the
	desired target architecture:
		sparc, m68k, i386, ns32k, vax, or powerpc

	If your target is an m68k machine, you must edit config/tc-m68k.h.
	* Remove the line ``#include <machine/param.h>''.
	* Replace ``MID_MACHINE'' in the line:
		#define AOUT_MACHTYPE MID_MACHINE
	  with:
		MID_M68K	(for m68k 8k page machine targets)
		MID_M68K4K	(for m68k 4k page machine targets)
	  If you are unsure which of these applies to your target, examine
	  $(BSDSRCDIR)/sys/arch/<target-machine>/include/param.h

2.	Run ``make''.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

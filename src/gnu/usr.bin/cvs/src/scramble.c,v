 * This is NOT secure encryption.
 *
 * It would be tempting to encode the password according to username
 * and repository, so that the same password would encode to a
 * different string when used with different usernames and/or
 * repositories.  However, then users would not be able to cut and
 * paste passwords around.  They're not supposed to anyway, but we all
 * know they will, and there's no reason to make it harder for them if

 *
 * No character in any of these domains maps to a character in another

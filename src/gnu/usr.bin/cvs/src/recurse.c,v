/* Start a recursive command.
 *
 * INPUT
 *
 *   fileproc
 *     Function called with each file as an argument.
 *
 *   filesdoneproc
 *     Function called after all the files in a directory have been processed,
 *     before subdirectories have been processed.
 *
 *   direntproc
 *     Function called immediately upon entering a directory, before processing
 *     any files or subdirectories.
 *
 *   dirleaveproc
 *     Function called upon finishing a directory, immediately before leaving
 *     it and returning control to the function processing the parent
 *     directory.
 *
 *   callerdat
 *   	This void * is passed to the functions above.
 *
 *   argc, argv
 *     The files on which to operate, interpreted as command line arguments.
 *     In the special case of no arguments, defaults to operating on the
 *     current directory (`.').
 *
 *   local
 *
 *   which
 *     specifies the kind of recursion.  There are several cases:
 *
 *       1.  W_LOCAL is not set but W_REPOS or W_ATTIC is.  The current
 *       directory when we are called must be the repository and
 *       recursion proceeds according to what exists in the repository.
 *
 *       2a.  W_LOCAL is set but W_REPOS and W_ATTIC are not.  The
 *       current directory when we are called must be the working
 *       directory.  Recursion proceeds according to what exists in the
 *       working directory, never (I think) consulting any part of the
 *       repository which does not correspond to the working directory
 *       ("correspond" == Name_Repository).
 *
 *       2b.  W_LOCAL is set and so is W_REPOS or W_ATTIC.  This is the
 *       weird one.  The current directory when we are called must be
 *       the working directory.  We recurse through working directories,
 *       but we recurse into a directory if it is exists in the working
 *       directory *or* it exists in the repository.  If a directory
 *       does not exist in the working directory, the direntproc must
 *       either tell us to skip it (R_SKIP_ALL), or must create it (I
 *       think those are the only two cases).
 *
 *   aflag
 *   locktype
 *   update_preload
 *   dosrcs
 *
 *   repository_in
 *     keeps track of the repository string.  This is only for the remote mode,
 *     specifically, r* commands (rtag, rdiff, co, ...) where xgetcwd() was used
 *     to locate the repository.  Things would break when xgetcwd() was used
 *     with a symlinked repository because xgetcwd() would return the true path
 *     and in some cases this would cause the path to be printed as other than
 *     the user specified in error messages and in other cases some of CVS's
 *     security assertions would fail.
 *
 * GLOBALS
 *   ???
 *
 * OUTPUT
 *
 *  callerdat can be modified by the FILEPROC, FILESDONEPROC, DIRENTPROC, and
 *  DIRLEAVEPROC.
 *
 * RETURNS
 *   A count of errors counted by walking the argument list with
 *   unroll_files_proc() and do_recursion().
 *
 * ERRORS
 *   Fatal errors occur:
 *     1.  when there were no arguments and the current directory
 *         does not contain CVS metadata.
 *     2.  when all but the last path element from an argument from ARGV cannot
 *         be found to be a local directory.

	   The node in capitals are those directories which are
	   checked out from current_cvsroot.  We want the list to
	   contain B, C, F, and G.  D, H, and I are not included,
	   because their parents are also checked out from
	   current_cvsroot.

	   The algorithm should be:

	   1) construct a tree of all directory names where each
	   element contains a directory name and a flag which notes if
	   that directory is checked out from current_cvsroot

			      a0
			     / \
			    B1  C1
			   / \
			  D1  e0
			     / \
			    F1  G1
			       / \
			      H1  I1

	   2) Recursively descend the tree.  For each node, recurse
	   before processing the node.  If the flag is zero, do
	   nothing.  If the flag is 1, check the node's parent.  If
	   the parent's flag is one, change the current entry's flag
	   to zero.

			      a0
			     / \
			    B1  C1
			   / \
			  D0  e0
			     / \
			    F1  G1
			       / \
			      H0  I0

	   3) Walk the tree and spit out "Argument" commands to tell
	   the server which directories to munge.

	   Yuck.  It's not clear this is worth spending time on, since
	   we might want to disable cvs commands entirely from
	   directories that do not have CVSADM files...

	   Anyways, the solution as it stands has modified server.c
	   (dirswitch) to create admin files [via server.c
	   (create_adm_p)] in all path elements for a client's
	   "Directory xxx" command, which forces the server to descend
	   and serve the files there.  client.c (send_file_names) has
	   also been modified to send only those arguments which are
	   appropriate to current_parsed_root.

       The most straightforward fix would just to readlock the whole
       tree before starting an update, but that means that if a commit
       gets blocked on a big update, it might need to wait a *long*
       time.

       A more adequate fix would be a two-pass design for update,
       checkout, etc.  The first pass would go through the repository,
       with the whole tree readlocked, noting what versions of each
       file we want to get.  The second pass would release all locks
       (except perhaps short-term locks on one file at a
       time--although I think RCS already deals with this) and
       actually get the files, specifying the particular versions it wants.

       This could be sped up by separating out the data needed for the
       first pass into a separate file(s)--for example a file
       attribute for each file whose value contains the head revision
       for each branch.  The structure should be designed so that
       commit can relatively quickly update the information for a
       single file or a handful of files (file attributes, as
       implemented in Jan 96, are probably acceptable; improvements
       would be possible such as branch attributes which are in
       separate files for each branch).  */

 * INPUT
 *
 *   fileproc
 *     Function called with each file as an argument.
 *
 *   filesdoneproc
 *     Function called after all the files in a directory have been processed,
 *     before subdirectories have been processed.
 *
 *   direntproc
 *     Function called immediately upon entering a directory, before processing
 *     any files or subdirectories.
 *
 *   dirleaveproc
 *     Function called upon finishing a directory, immediately before leaving
 *     it and returning control to the function processing the parent
 *     directory.
 *
 *   callerdat
 *   	This void * is passed to the functions above.
 *
 *   argc, argv
 *     The files on which to operate, interpreted as command line arguments.
 *     In the special case of no arguments, defaults to operating on the
 *     current directory (`.').
 *
 *   local
 *
 *   which
 *     specifies the kind of recursion.  There are several cases:
 *
 *       1.  W_LOCAL is not set but W_REPOS or W_ATTIC is.  The current
 *       directory when we are called must be the repository and
 *       recursion proceeds according to what exists in the repository.
 *
 *       2a.  W_LOCAL is set but W_REPOS and W_ATTIC are not.  The
 *       current directory when we are called must be the working
 *       directory.  Recursion proceeds according to what exists in the
 *       working directory, never (I think) consulting any part of the
 *       repository which does not correspond to the working directory
 *       ("correspond" == Name_Repository).
 *
 *       2b.  W_LOCAL is set and so is W_REPOS or W_ATTIC.  This is the
 *       weird one.  The current directory when we are called must be
 *       the working directory.  We recurse through working directories,
 *       but we recurse into a directory if it is exists in the working
 *       directory *or* it exists in the repository.  If a directory
 *       does not exist in the working directory, the direntproc must
 *       either tell us to skip it (R_SKIP_ALL), or must create it (I
 *       think those are the only two cases).
 *
 *   aflag
 *   locktype
 *   update_preload
 *   dosrcs
 *
 *   repository_in
 *     keeps track of the repository string.  This is only for the remote mode,
 *     specifically, r* commands (rtag, rdiff, co, ...) where xgetcwd() was used
 *     to locate the repository.  Things would break when xgetcwd() was used
 *     with a symlinked repository because xgetcwd() would return the true path
 *     and in some cases this would cause the path to be printed as other than
 *     the user specified in error messages and in other cases some of CVS's
 *     security assertions would fail.
 *
 * GLOBALS
 *   ???
 *
 * OUTPUT
 *
 *  callerdat can be modified by the FILEPROC, FILESDONEPROC, DIRENTPROC, and
 *  DIRLEAVEPROC.
 *
 * RETURNS
 *   A count of errors counted by walking the argument list with
 *   unroll_files_proc() and do_recursion().
 *
 * ERRORS
 *   Fatal errors occur:
 *     1.  when there were no arguments and the current directory
 *         does not contain CVS metadata.
 *     2.  when all but the last path element from an argument from ARGV cannot
 *         be found to be a local directory.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright  1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

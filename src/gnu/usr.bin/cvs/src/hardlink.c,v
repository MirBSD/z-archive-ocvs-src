/* Collect and manage hardlink info associated with a particular file.  */

#include "cvs.h"
#include "hardlink.h"

/* The structure currently used to manage hardlink info is a list.
   Therefore, most of the functions which manipulate hardlink data
   are walklist procedures.  This is not a very efficient implementation;
   if someone decides to use a real hash table (for instance), then
   much of this code can be rewritten to be a little less arcane.

   Each element of `hardlist' represents an inode.  It is keyed on the
   inode number, and points to a list of files.  This is to make it
   easy to find out what files are linked to a given file FOO: find
   FOO's inode, look it up in hardlist, and retrieve the list of files
   associated with that inode.

   Each file node, in turn, is represented by a `hardlink_info' struct,
   which includes `status' and `links' fields.  The `status' field should
   be used by a procedure like commit_fileproc or update_fileproc to
   record each file's status; that way, after all file links have been
   recorded, CVS can check the linkage of files which are in doubt
   (i.e. T_NEEDS_MERGE files).

@update to cvs 1.12.10-MirOS except automatically

XXX I suggest to _not_ update.

XXX *** IMPORTANT *** DO NOT ACCESS CVS 1.11 REPOSITORIES
XXX *** IMPORTANT *** WITH CVS 1.12 OR VICE VERSA!

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/* alloca (N) returns a pointer to N bytes of memory
   allocated on the stack, which will last until the function returns.
   Use of alloca should be avoided:
     - inside arguments of function calls - undefined behaviour,
     - in inline functions - the allocation may actually last until the
       calling function returns,
     - for huge N (say, N >= 65536) - you never know how large (or small)
       the stack is, and when the stack cannot fulfill the memory allocation
       request, the program just crashes.

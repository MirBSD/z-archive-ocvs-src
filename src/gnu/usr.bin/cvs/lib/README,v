log
@Initial revision

text
@Many of the source files in this directory come from the GNULIB project
<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib/>/<mailto:bug-gnulib@@gnu.org>, and,
if they don't, they should.

What this means is that there is often at least one corresponding Autoconf
macro in the CVS/m4 directory and that bug fixes and enhancements to this code
should be sent to the GNULIB project and then reimported here after the GNULIB
developers approve and adopt the change.  Changes should not be made locally
without good reason!

# BTW, i wrote a perl script that is similar to 'nfpipe' except that in
# addition to logging to a file it provides a command line option for mailing
# change notices to a group of users. Obviously you probably wouldn't want
# to mail every change. But there may be certain directories that are commonly
# accessed by a group of users who would benefit from an email notice. 
# Especially if they regularly beat on the same directory. Anyway if you 
# think anyone would be interested here it is.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@update to cvs 1.12.10-MirOS except automatically
generated files
XXX this installs as /usr/bin/ncvs yet, so no
XXX conflicts during the test phase.
XXX I suggest to _not_ update.

XXX *** IMPORTANT *** DO NOT ACCESS CVS 1.11 REPOSITORIES
XXX *** IMPORTANT *** WITH CVS 1.12 OR VICE VERSA!

# This program should be run in a working directory that has been
# checked out using CVS.  It identifies files that have been added,
# changed, or removed in the working directory, but not "cvs
# committed".  It also determines whether the files have been "cvs
# added" or "cvs removed".  For directories, it is only practical to
# determine whether they have been added.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

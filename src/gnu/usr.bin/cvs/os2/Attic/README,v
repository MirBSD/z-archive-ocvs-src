@        This port requires IBM C/C++ and the IBM TCPIP library.  It
has probably only been tested with the CVS client.  Local CVS might or
might not work, and the server would definitely not work.  You'll need
to edit the makefile to reflect your system's paths (unless you're our
customer for this port, in which case the paths are correct because we
did the port on your machine. :-) ).  You also may need to comment out
the "Makefile" rule in emx/Makefile to avoid a complaint about
../config.status not existing.  You also might need to edit srcdir to
be "." and top_srcdir to be "..".

        That should be all -- edit the makefile, do "make" and get
os2\cvs.exe.  Assuming you have edited the `install_dir' variable in
the Makefile, you may type "make install-cvs" to put cvs.exe in the
right place.

        If the makefile has linefeeds only at the end of lines, make
(at least the port of GNU make that I have) will interpret it
differently.  This is (IMHO) a bizarre behavior, but you need to
convert the linefeeds to CRLF pairs (editing the file with an editor
such as emacs will generally do this).

        There are two compiler warnings in os2/popen.c which we haven't
figured out the cause of.  Other than that there probably aren't a whole
lot of warnings (but there might be a few).
Report bugs to <bug-cvs@@gnu.org>.



Some notes on the watcom port:
------------------------------

You need the OS/2 TCPIP developers toolkit to translate the sources.
This is not as bad as it sounds, since the toolkit is on your OS/2
CD.

To compile the sources, enter

        wmake -f watcom.mak

at the OS/2 prompt.

The executable created by the watcom compiler does *not* need a runtime
DLL.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

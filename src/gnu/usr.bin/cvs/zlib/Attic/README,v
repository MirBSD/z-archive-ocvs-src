@zlib 1.1.3 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code
is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library
is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files 
ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate
format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in
other formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact jloup@@gzip.org). A usage
example of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that
the library is working correctly. Another example is given in the file
minigzip.c. The compression library itself is composed of all source files
except example.c and minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions
given at the top of Makefile. In short "make test; make install"
should work for most machines. For Unix: "configure; make test; make install"
For MSDOS, use one of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc.
For VMS, use Make_vms.com or descrip.mms.

Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@@quest.jpl.nasa.gov>, or to
Gilles Vollant <info@@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.
The zlib home page is http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
The official zlib ftp site is ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
Before reporting a problem, please check those sites to verify that
you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest version and
check whether the problem still exists or not.

Mark Nelson <markn@@tiny.com> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997
issue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available in
http://web2.airmail.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm

The changes made in version 1.1.3 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
The main changes since 1.1.2 are:

- fix "an inflate input buffer bug that shows up on rare but persistent
  occasions" (Mark)
- fix gzread and gztell for concatenated .gz files (Didier Le Botlan)
- fix gzseek(..., SEEK_SET) in write mode
- fix crc check after a gzeek (Frank Faubert)
- fix miniunzip when the last entry in a zip file is itself a zip file
  (J Lillge)
- add contrib/asm586 and contrib/asm686 (Brian Raiter)
  See http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/assembly.html
- add support for Delphi 3 in contrib/delphi (Bob Dellaca)
- add support for C++Builder 3 and Delphi 3 in contrib/delphi2 (Davide Moretti)
- do not exit prematurely in untgz if 0 at start of block (Magnus Holmgren)
- use macro EXTERN instead of extern to support DLL for BeOS (Sander Stoks)
- added a FAQ file

plus many changes for portability.

Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory "contrib".

A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit 1.1
http://www.javasoft.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/Package-java.util.zip.html
See the zlib home page http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/ for details.

A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmarquess@@bfsec.bt.co.uk>
is in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, such as:
ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Compress/Compress-Zlib*

A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@@magnet.com>
is available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see
http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html

A zlib binding for TCL written by Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@@westend.com>
is availlable at http://www.westend.com/~kupries/doc/trf/man/man.html

An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format,
written on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@@winimage.com>, is
available at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html
and also in the contrib/minizip directory of zlib.


Notes for some targets:

- To build a Windows DLL version, include in a DLL project zlib.def, zlib.rc
  and all .c files except example.c and minigzip.c; compile with -DZLIB_DLL
  The zlib DLL support was initially done by Alessandro Iacopetti and is
  now maintained by Gilles Vollant <info@@winimage.com>. Check the zlib DLL
  home page at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll

  From Visual Basic, you can call the DLL functions which do not take
  a structure as argument: compress, uncompress and all gz* functions.
  See contrib/visual-basic.txt for more information, or get
  http://www.tcfb.com/dowseware/cmp-z-it.zip

- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization.
  With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with
  the -n32 compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1   
  it works when compiled with cc.

- on Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1
  is necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works
  with other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac compilers.

- For Turbo C the small model is supported only with reduced performance to
  avoid any far allocation; it was tested with -DMAX_WBITS=11 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=3

- For PalmOs, see http://www.cs.uit.no/~perm/PASTA/pilot/software.html

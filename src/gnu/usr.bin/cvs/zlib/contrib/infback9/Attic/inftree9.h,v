@update to cvs 1.12.10-MirOS except automatically
generated files
XXX this installs as /usr/bin/ncvs yet, so no
XXX conflicts during the test phase.
XXX I suggest to _not_ update.

XXX *** IMPORTANT *** DO NOT ACCESS CVS 1.11 REPOSITORIES
XXX *** IMPORTANT *** WITH CVS 1.12 OR VICE VERSA!

/* Structure for decoding tables.  Each entry provides either the
   information needed to do the operation requested by the code that
   indexed that table entry, or it provides a pointer to another
   table that indexes more bits of the code.  op indicates whether
   the entry is a pointer to another table, a literal, a length or
   distance, an end-of-block, or an invalid code.  For a table
   pointer, the low four bits of op is the number of index bits of
   that table.  For a length or distance, the low four bits of op
   is the number of extra bits to get after the code.  bits is
   the number of bits in this code or part of the code to drop off
   of the bit buffer.  val is the actual byte to output in the case
   of a literal, the base length or distance, or the offset from
   the current table to the next table.  Each entry is four bytes. */

@;; -*- lisp-interaction -*-

;;
;; Set emacs up for editing code using CVS indentation conventions.
;; See HACKING for more on what those conventions are.
;; To use, put in your .emacs:
;;   (load "c-mode")
;;   (load "cvs-format.el")
;; You need to load c-mode first or else when c-mode autoloads it will
;; clobber the settings from cvs-format.el.  Using c-mode-hook perhaps would
;; be a cleaner way to handle that.  Or see below about (set-c-style "BSD").
;;
;; Credits: Originally from the personal .emacs file of Rich Pixley,
;;      then rich@@cygnus.com, circa 1992.  He sez "feel free to copy."
;;

;;
;;
;;	This section sets constants used by c-mode for formating
;;
;;

;;  If `c-auto-newline' is non-`nil', newlines are inserted both
;;before and after braces that you insert, and after colons and semicolons.
;;Correct C indentation is done on all the lines that are made this way.

(setq c-auto-newline nil)


;;*Non-nil means TAB in C mode should always reindent the current line,
;;regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
;;It might be desirable to set this to nil for CVS, since unlike GNU
;; CVS often uses comments over to the right separated by TABs.
;; Depends some on whether you're in the habit of using TAB to
;; reindent.
;(setq c-tab-always-indent nil)

;;; It seems to me that 
;;;    `M-x set-c-style BSD RET'
;;; or
;;;    (set-c-style "BSD")
;;; takes care of the indentation parameters correctly.


;;  C does not have anything analogous to particular function names for which
;;special forms of indentation are desirable.  However, it has a different
;;need for customization facilities: many different styles of C indentation
;;are in common use.
;;
;;  There are six variables you can set to control the style that Emacs C
;;mode will use.
;;
;;`c-indent-level'     
;;     Indentation of C statements within surrounding block.  The surrounding
;;     block's indentation is the indentation of the line on which the
;;     open-brace appears.

(setq c-indent-level 4)

;;`c-continued-statement-offset'     
;;     Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the then-clause of
;;     an if or body of a while.

(setq c-continued-statement-offset 4)

;;`c-brace-offset'     
;;     Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.

(setq c-brace-offset -4)

;;`c-brace-imaginary-offset'     
;;     An open brace following other text is treated as if it were this far
;;     to the right of the start of its line.

(setq c-brace-imaginary-offset 0)

;;`c-argdecl-indent'     
;;     Indentation level of declarations of C function arguments.

(setq c-argdecl-indent 4)

;;`c-label-offset'     
;;     Extra indentation for line that is a label, or case or default.
;;  This doesn't quite do the right thing for CVS switches, which use the
;;    switch (foo)
;;    {
;;        case 0:
;;            break;
;;  style.  But if one manually aligns the first case, then the rest
;;  should work OK.
(setq c-label-offset -4)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

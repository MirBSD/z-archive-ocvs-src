@give up on gcc 3.4
GNU make is just too... /* */
@
text
@This README file is copied into the directory for GCC-only header files
when fixincludes is run by the makefile for GCC.

Many of the files in this directory were automatically edited from the
standard system header files by the fixincludes process.  They are
system-specific, and will not work on any other kind of system.  They
are also not part of GCC.  The reason we have to do this is because
GCC requires ANSI C headers and many vendors supply ANSI-incompatible
headers.

Because this is an automated process, sometimes headers get "fixed"
that do not, strictly speaking, need a fix.  As long as nothing is broken
by the process, it is just an unfortunate collateral inconvenience.
We would like to rectify it, if it is not "too inconvenient".

1.1.2.1
log
@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"
- gcc/gcc/ginclude/<x>

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

These files are considered part of MirOS.

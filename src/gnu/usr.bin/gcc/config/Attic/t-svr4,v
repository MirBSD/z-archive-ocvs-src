@# We need to use -fPIC when we are using gcc to compile the routines in
# crtstuff.c.  This is only really needed when we are going to use gcc/g++
# to produce a shared library, but since we don't know ahead of time when
# we will be doing that, we just always use -fPIC when compiling the
# routines in crtstuff.c.  Likewise for libgcc2.c.

CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS = -fPIC
TARGET_LIBGCC2_CFLAGS = -fPIC

# See all the declarations.
FIXPROTO_DEFINES = -D_XOPEN_SOURCE

@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"
- gcc/gcc/ginclude/<x>

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

These files are considered part of MirOS.

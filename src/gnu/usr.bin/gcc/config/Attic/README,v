@remove this "documentation" thing some people have
not yet told me what they need it for, since there
is such a thing as CVS Changelogs, and RCS log de-
scriptions.

@This directory contains machine-specific files for the GNU C compiler.
It has a subdirectory for each basic CPU type.
The only files in this directory itself
are some .h files that pertain to particular operating systems
and are used for more than one CPU type.

1.1.2.1
log
@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"
- gcc/gcc/ginclude/<x>

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

These files are considered part of MirOS.

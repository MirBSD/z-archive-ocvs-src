/* Note - there are three possible -mfpu= arguments that can be passed to
   the assembler:
   
     -mfpu=softvfp   This is the default.  It indicates thats doubles are
                     stored in a format compatible with the VFP
		     specification.  This is the newer double format, whereby
		     the endian-ness of the doubles matches the endian-ness
		     of the memory architecture.
     
     -mfpu=fpa       This is when -mhard-float is specified.
                     [It is not known if any XScale's have been made with
		     hardware floating point support, but nevertheless this
		     is what happens].
		     
     -mfpu=softfpa   This is when -msoft-float is specified.
                     This is the normal behavior of other arm configurations,
		     which for backwards compatibility purposes default to
		     supporting the old FPA format which was always big
		     endian, regardless of the endian-ness of the memory
		     system.  */

@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"
- gcc/gcc/ginclude/<x>

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

These files are considered part of MirOS.

# This is probably the correct define, to override the Makefile
# default, but using it causes more problems than it solves.
#
# Using it will cause fixincludes to try and fix some of the
# mwcc header files, which it seems to do a poor job of.  On
# the other hand, not using it will only cause the gcc version
# of limits.h to lack the header and trailer parts that are
# tacked on to it when there is a limits.h in the system header
# dir.
#
# For now it is probably better to change the rule for
# LIMITS_H_TEST to explicitly look for the BeOS limits.h.
# If the gcc limits.h is not set up to #include_next the
# BeOS limits.h, then some things will go undefined, like
# PATH_MAX.

#SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR=/boot/develop/headers/posix
# Test to see whether <limits.h> exists in the system header files.

@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"
- gcc/gcc/ginclude/<x>

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

These files are considered part of MirOS.

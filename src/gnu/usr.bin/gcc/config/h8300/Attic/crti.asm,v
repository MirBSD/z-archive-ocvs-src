/* The code in sections .init and .fini is supposed to be a single
   regular function.  The function in .init is called directly from
   start in crt0.asm.  The function in .fini is atexit()ed in crt0.asm
   too.

   crti.asm contributes the prologue of a function to these sections,
   and crtn.asm comes up the epilogue.  STARTFILE_SPEC should list
   crti.o before any other object files that might add code to .init
   or .fini sections, and ENDFILE_SPEC should list crtn.o after any
   such object files.  */

@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

@# In order to work around the very problems that force us to now generally
# create a libgcc.so, glibc reexported a number of routines from libgcc.a.
# By now choosing the same version tags for these specific routines, we
# maintain enough binary compatibility to allow future versions of glibc
# to defer implementation of these routines to libgcc.so via DT_AUXILIARY.

# Note that we cannot use the default libgcc-glibc.ver file on sh,
# because GLIBC_2.0 does not exist on this architecture, as the first 
# ever glibc release on the platform was GLIBC_2.2.

@GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.2 from the FSF
- gcc/gcc/<x> for any <x> of type FILE only
- gcc/gcc/config/<x> for any <x> of type FILE or DIR
- gcc/gcc/fixinc/<x> for any <x> not match "tests@@(|/*)"
- gcc/gcc/ginclude/<x>

This will be lndir'd into the 'gcc' module for
fullgcc builds; the build scripts will reside
in the 'gcc' module, with some helpers in 'src'.

These files are considered part of MirOS.

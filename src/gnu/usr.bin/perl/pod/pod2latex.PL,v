=head1 NAME

pod2latex - convert pod documentation to latex format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pod2latex *.pm

  pod2latex -out mytex.tex *.pod

  pod2latex -full -sections 'DESCRIPTION|NAME' SomeDir

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pod2latex> is a program to convert POD format documentation
(L<perlpod>) into latex. It can process multiple input documents at a
time and either generate a latex file per input document or a single
combined output file.

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

This section describes the supported command line options. Minimum
matching is supported.

=over 4

=item B<-out>

Name of the output file to be used. If there are multiple input pods
it is assumed that the intention is to write all translated output
into a single file. C<.tex> is appended if not present.  If the
argument is not supplied, a single document will be created for each
input file.

=item B<-full>

Creates a complete C<latex> file that can be processed immediately
(unless C<=for/=begin> directives are used that rely on extra packages).
Table of contents and index generation commands are included in the
wrapper C<latex> code.

=item B<-sections>

Specify pod sections to include (or remove if negated) in the
translation.  See L<Pod::Select/"SECTION SPECIFICATIONS"> for the
format to use for I<section-spec>. This option may be given multiple
times on the command line.This is identical to the similar option in
the C<podselect()> command.

=item B<-modify>

This option causes the output C<latex> to be slightly
modified from the input pod such that when a C<=head1 NAME>
is encountered a section is created containing the actual
pod name (rather than B<NAME>) and all subsequent C<=head1>
directives are treated as subsections. This has the advantage
that the description of a module will be in its own section
which is helpful for including module descriptions in documentation.
Also forces C<latex> label and index entries to be prefixed by the
name of the module.

=item B<-h1level>

Specifies the C<latex> section that is equivalent to a C<H1> pod
directive. This is an integer between 0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to a
C<latex> chapter, 1 equivalent to a C<latex> section etc. The default
is 1 (C<H1> equivalent to a latex section).

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message and exit.

=item B<-man>

Print the manual page and exit.

=item B<-verbose>

Print information messages as each document is processed.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Known bugs are:

=over 4

=item * 

Cross references between documents are not resolved when multiple
pod documents are converted into a single output C<latex> file.

=item * 

Functions and variables are not automatically recognized 
and they will therefore not be marked up in any special way
unless instructed by an explicit pod command.

@==============================================================================
                Release of version 0.77 of Attribute::Handlers
==============================================================================


NAME
    Attribute::Handlers - Simpler definition of attribute handlers

DESCRIPTION
    This module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's class to
    define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes. Variables
    and subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or in packages
    derived from that package may be given attributes with the same names as
    the attribute handler subroutines, which will then be called at the end
    of the compilation phase (i.e. in a `CHECK' block).

EXAMPLE

	package UNIVERSAL;
	use Attribute::Handlers;

	my %name;
	sub name { return $name{$_[2]}||*{$_[1]}{NAME} }

	sub Name    :ATTR { $name{$_[2]} = $_[4] }

	sub Purpose :ATTR { print STDERR "Purpose of ", &name, " is $_[4]\n" }

	sub Unit    :ATTR { print STDERR &name, " measured in $_[4]\n" }


	package main;

	my $capacity : Name(capacity)
		     : Purpose(to store max storage capacity for files)
		     : Unit(Gb);

	package Other;

	sub foo : Purpose(to foo all data before barring it) { }

	- Since Attribute::Handlers now is core, I will refer to changes
	with their patch number, please read  Porting/repository.pod from
	your a perl tarball for more information.

	- Brought up to date with perl 5.8RC1 version 
	will be 5.8 if no more changes come in

	- [#13686] This changes the behaviour of lexical attributes.
	Prior to this lexical attributes were done at a compile time, 
	and they would loose their attribute on the next run over them.
	Now perl 5.8 calls the attribute handler runtime whenever it hits my.

	- [#14448] Fixes cases with too high refcounts on lexical attributes

	- [#15945] Do not warn about too late CHECK and INIT block if
	A::H is pulled in using a require.


==============================================================================

AVAILABILITY

Attribute::Handlers has been uploaded to the CPAN
and is also available from:

	http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/CPAN/Attribute-Handlers.tar.gz

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

	- [#17940] Includes :unique and :shared in the builtin types

	- From perl 5.8 { __CALLER__::foo => __PACKAGE } is missparsed,
	the proper approach is to use  { '__CALLER__::foo' => __PACKAGE }.
	The documentation is updated to reflect this.

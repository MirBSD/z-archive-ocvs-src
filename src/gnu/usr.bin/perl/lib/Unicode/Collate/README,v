@Unicode/Collate version 0.12
===============================

Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

  UCA - Unicode TR #10.
  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/

  Fetch the following file and put it into the Unicode/Collate directory.
  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/allkeys.txt

  You can install this module using a subset "keys.txt"
  contained in this distribution without the "allkeys.txt";
  but "keys.txt" is small and not very useful.

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Collate;

  #construct
  $Collator = Unicode::Collate->new(%tailoring);

  #sort
  @@sorted = $Collator->sort(@@not_sorted);

  #compare
  $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.
  $result = $Collator->eq($a, $b);  # returns true/false
    (similarly ->ne, ->lt, ->le, ->gt, ->ge)

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.006 or later

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  It's better if you have Unicode::Normalize (v 0.10 or later)
  although Unicode::Collate can be used without Unicode::Normalize.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

  Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

Perl 5.6.1 or later

To use this module, it is better to install a table file in the UCA format,
by copying it into the lib/Unicode/Collate directory.

The most preferable one is "The Default Unicode Collation Element Table",
available from the Unicode consortium's website:

    http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/allkeys.txt

Though this distribution contains a subset of allkeys.txt, named "keys.txt",
this one is intended only for doing a test of this module
and practically useless for any other purpose.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

Unicode/Collate version 0.33

(recommended: Perl 5.8.0 or later)

To use this module, it is recommended to install a table file
in the UCA format, by copying it into the directory
where F<Unicode/Collate.pm> is installed;
e.g. into F<perl/lib/Unicode/Collate/> directory
if you have F<perl/lib/Unicode/Collate.pm>.

The most preferable one is "The Default Unicode Collation Element Table",
available from the Unicode consortium's website:

  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt (latest version)

Though this distribution contains a subset of allkeys.txt, named "keys.txt",
this one is intended only for doing a test of this module
and practically useless for any other purpose.

(!! XSUB for Unicode::Collate is an EXPERIMENTAL support !!)
If you have a C compiler and want to use XSUB edition,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):
d37 2
a38 5
   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
d40 1
a40 2
If you decide to install pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition after trying
to build XSUB, type the following:
d42 3
a44 6
   make clean
   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

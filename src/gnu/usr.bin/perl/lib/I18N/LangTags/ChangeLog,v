	to test.pl, at Jarkko's request.

2001-06-20  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org
	
	* Release 0.24

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

	Minor bugfix to I18N::LangTags::List code.  Addition of the

	* Release 0.33

	Minor bugfix version:
	The test 80_all_env.t was erroneously failing for people with
	LC_ALL or LC_MESSAGES set.  Fixed.  Thanks to everyone, especially
	Nicholas Clark, who patiently helped out with this.

	
2004-06-20  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org

	* Release 0.32

	Minor bugfix version:
	The test 80_all_env.t was erroneously failing under MSWins that
	had Win32::Locale installed.  A workaround added.
	
	
2004-06-17  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org

	* Release 0.31
	
        Corrected some unevennesses in when/whether the return values from
	I18N::LangTags::Detect's various internal functions would be
	downcased.  Now they're /always/ downcased, and are /always/ fed
	thru alternate_language_tags()!

	Also, spiffed up and generally improved the earlier test
	80_all_env.t, which not even I could make sense of, and I wrote
	the damned thing.  Now it's sane, and checks both scalar and
	list return values.  Thanks to Rafael Garcia-Suarez and the
	various CPAN-Testers for prodding me to fix this.  (Hopefully the
	earlier problems /are/ now fixed!  Otherwise there'll be another
	version of this module out real soon!)

	
2004-03-30  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org

	* Release 0.30

	New in I18N::LangTags : implicate_supers and
	implicate_supers_strictly.

	New module: I18N::LangTags::Detect.

	Some new tests.

	Thanks to Autrijus Tang for catching some errors in my makefile!

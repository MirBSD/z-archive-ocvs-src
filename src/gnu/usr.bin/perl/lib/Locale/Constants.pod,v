=head1 NAME

Locale::Constants - constants for Locale codes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Locale::Constants;
    
    $codeset = LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Locale::Constants> defines symbols which are used in
the four modules from the Locale-Codes distribution:

	Locale::Language
	Locale::Country
	Locale::Currency
	Locale::Script

B<Note:> at the moment only Locale::Country and Locale::Script
support more than one code set.

The symbols defined are used to specify which codes you
want to be used:

	LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
	LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
	LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC

You shouldn't have to C<use> this module directly yourself -
it is used by the three Locale modules, which in turn export
the symbols.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

None at the moment.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

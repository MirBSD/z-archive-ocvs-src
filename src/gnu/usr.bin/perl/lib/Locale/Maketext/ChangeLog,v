@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

2003-06-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org
	* Release 1.06:  Now has "use utf8" to make the things work
	happily.  Some fancy footwork is required to make this work under
	pre-utf8 perl versions.
	
2003-04-18  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org
	* Release 1.05:  Different Makefile.PL, same .pm code.
	
	Jesse Vincent, Hugo van der Sanden, and Jarkko Hietaniemi
	encourage me to add this to the makefile:
	 ($] < 5.008) ? () : ( INSTALLDIRS => 'perl'),
	so that when you install this on a recent version of perl (5.8 or
	later), the installation will overwrite the Maketext.pm in your
	core library directory.  Email me if this produces trouble for any
	of you folks out there, okay?
	
2003-04-02  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org
	* Release 1.04: Implementing proper HTTP "tag;q=rank" parsing for
	get_handle.  This should make all the difference for users/victims
	of the current version of Safari, which uses that syntax as well
	as inserts random languages with low q numbers.
	Thanks to Jesse Vincent and the whole RT junta for finding this.

	* Added more tests, now in t/

	* Lots of typo fixes to Maketext.pm.  Thanks to Evan A. Zacks for
	patient help in finding them all.

	* Release 1.09:

	* Moved the language-preference-detecting code into new module
	I18N::LangTags::Detect.
	
	Thanks to Autrijus Tang for catching some errors in the dist!


	
2004-01-19  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org
	
	* Release 1.08:
	
	* Corrected a one-line code bug in v1.07 that accidentally demoted
	all en-* tags in cases of lexicon-groups that had an en.pm but no
	en_*.pm.  Thanks to Robert Spier for spotting this.  Test added.
	So don't use v1.07!

	* Autrijus found some typoes in the TPJ article.  Fixed.1
	
2004-01-11  Sean M. Burke  sburke@@cpan.org
	
	* Release 1.07:  Now uses a new and different rule for implicating
	superordinate language tags in accept-language lists.  Previously,
	superordinates were just tacked onto the, so "en-US, ja", turned
	into "en-US, ja, en".  However, this turned out to be suboptimal
	for many users of RT, a popular system using Maketext.  The new
	rule is that a tag implicates superordinate forms right after it,
	unless those tags are explicitly stated elsewhere in the
	accept-languages list.  So "en-US ja" becomes "en-US en ja".  If
	you want "en" to be really lower, you have to actually state it
	there: "en-US ja en" is left as-is.

	The 04super.t and 05super.t tests in t/ have many many examples of
	this, including some strange corner cases.

	(In implementing this change, I also refactored some code in
	Maketext.pm, for hopefully improved readability.  However,
	the above is the only actual change in behavior.)

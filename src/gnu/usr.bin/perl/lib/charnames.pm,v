=head1 NAME

charnames - define character names for C<\N{named}> string literal escapes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use charnames ':full';
  print "\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA} is called sigma.\n";

  use charnames ':short';
  print "\N{greek:Sigma} is an upper-case sigma.\n";

  use charnames qw(cyrillic greek);
  print "\N{sigma} is Greek sigma, and \N{be} is Cyrillic b.\n";

  print charnames::viacode(0x1234); # prints "ETHIOPIC SYLLABLE SEE"
  printf "%04X", charnames::vianame("GOTHIC LETTER AHSA"); # prints "10330"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pragma C<use charnames> supports arguments C<:full>, C<:short> and
script names.  If C<:full> is present, for expansion of
C<\N{CHARNAME}> string C<CHARNAME> is first looked in the list of
standard Unicode names of chars.  If C<:short> is present, and
C<CHARNAME> has the form C<SCRIPT:CNAME>, then C<CNAME> is looked up
as a letter in script C<SCRIPT>.  If pragma C<use charnames> is used
with script name arguments, then for C<\N{CHARNAME}> the name
C<CHARNAME> is looked up as a letter in the given scripts (in the
specified order).

For lookup of C<CHARNAME> inside a given script C<SCRIPTNAME>
this pragma looks for the names

  SCRIPTNAME CAPITAL LETTER CHARNAME
  SCRIPTNAME SMALL LETTER CHARNAME
  SCRIPTNAME LETTER CHARNAME

in the table of standard Unicode names.  If C<CHARNAME> is lowercase,
then the C<CAPITAL> variant is ignored, otherwise the C<SMALL> variant
is ignored.

Note that C<\N{...}> is compile-time, it's a special form of string
constant used inside double-quoted strings: in other words, you cannot
use variables inside the C<\N{...}>.  If you want similar run-time
functionality, use charnames::vianame().

For the C0 and C1 control characters (U+0000..U+001F, U+0080..U+009F)
as of Unicode 3.1, there are no official Unicode names but you can use
instead the ISO 6429 names (LINE FEED, ESCAPE, and so forth).  In
Unicode 3.2 (as of Perl 5.8) some naming changes take place ISO 6429
has been updated, see L</ALIASES>.  Also note that the U+UU80, U+0081,
U+0084, and U+0099 do not have names even in ISO 6429.

Since the Unicode standard uses "U+HHHH", so can you: "\N{U+263a}"
is the Unicode smiley face, or "\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}".

=head1 CUSTOM TRANSLATORS

The mechanism of translation of C<\N{...}> escapes is general and not
hardwired into F<charnames.pm>.  A module can install custom
translations (inside the scope which C<use>s the module) with the
following magic incantation:

    use charnames ();		# for $charnames::hint_bits
    sub import {
	shift;
	$^H |= $charnames::hint_bits;
	$^H{charnames} = \&translator;
    }

Here translator() is a subroutine which takes C<CHARNAME> as an
argument, and returns text to insert into the string instead of the
C<\N{CHARNAME}> escape.  Since the text to insert should be different
in C<bytes> mode and out of it, the function should check the current
state of C<bytes>-flag as in:

    use bytes ();			# for $bytes::hint_bits
    sub translator {
	if ($^H & $bytes::hint_bits) {
	    return bytes_translator(@@_);
	}
	else {
	    return utf8_translator(@@_);
	}
    }

=head1 charnames::viacode(code)

Returns the full name of the character indicated by the numeric code.
The example

    print charnames::viacode(0x2722);

prints "FOUR TEARDROP-SPOKED ASTERISK".

Returns undef if no name is known for the code.

This works only for the standard names, and does not yet apply 
to custom translators.

Notice that the name returned for of U+FEFF is "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK
SPACE", not "BYTE ORDER MARK".

=head1 charnames::vianame(name)

Returns the code point indicated by the name.
The example

    printf "%04X", charnames::vianame("FOUR TEARDROP-SPOKED ASTERISK");

prints "2722".

Returns undef if the name is unknown.

This works only for the standard names, and does not yet apply 
to custom translators.

=head1 ALIASES

A few aliases have been defined for convenience: instead of having
to use the official names

    LINE FEED (LF)
    FORM FEED (FF)
    CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
    NEXT LINE (NEL)

(yes, with parentheses) one can use

    LINE FEED
    FORM FEED
    CARRIAGE RETURN
    NEXT LINE
    LF
    FF
    CR
    NEL

One can also use

    BYTE ORDER MARK
    BOM

and

    ZWNJ
    ZWJ

for ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and ZERO WIDTH JOINER.

For backward compatibility one can use the old names for
certain C0 and C1 controls

    old                         new

    HORIZONTAL TABULATION       CHARACTER TABULATION
    VERTICAL TABULATION         LINE TABULATION
    FILE SEPARATOR              INFORMATION SEPARATOR FOUR
    GROUP SEPARATOR             INFORMATION SEPARATOR THREE
    RECORD SEPARATOR            INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO
    UNIT SEPARATOR              INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE
    PARTIAL LINE DOWN           PARTIAL LINE FORWARD
    PARTIAL LINE UP             PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD

but the old names in addition to giving the character
will also give a warning about being deprecated.

=head1 ILLEGAL CHARACTERS

If you ask by name for a character that does not exist, a warning is
given and the Unicode I<replacement character> "\x{FFFD}" is returned.

If you ask by code for a character that does not exist, no warning is
given and C<undef> is returned.  (Though if you ask for a code point
past U+10FFFF you do get a warning.)

=head1 BUGS

Since evaluation of the translation function happens in a middle of
compilation (of a string literal), the translation function should not
do any C<eval>s or C<require>s.  This restriction should be lifted in
a future version of Perl.

=head1 CUSTOM ALIASES

This version of charnames supports three mechanisms of adding local
or customized aliases to standard Unicode naming conventions (:full)

=head2 Anonymous hashes

    use charnames ":full", ":alias" => {
        e_ACUTE => "LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE",
        };
    my $str = "\N{e_ACUTE}";

=head2 Alias file

    use charnames ":full", ":alias" => "pro";

    will try to read "unicore/pro_alias.pl" from the @@INC path. This
    file should return a list in plain perl:

    (
    A_GRAVE         => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE",
    A_CIRCUM        => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX",
    A_DIAERES       => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS",
    A_TILDE         => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH TILDE",
    A_BREVE         => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE",
    A_RING          => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE",
    A_MACRON        => "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON",
    );

=head2 Alias shortcut

    use charnames ":alias" => ":pro";

    works exactly the same as the alias pairs, only this time,
    ":full" is inserted automatically as first argument (if no
    other argument is given).

=head1 NAME

validate - run many filetest checks on a tree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::CheckTree;

    $num_warnings = validate( q{
        /vmunix                 -e || die
        /boot                   -e || die
        /bin                    cd
            csh                 -ex
            csh                 !-ug
            sh                  -ex
            sh                  !-ug
        /usr                    -d || warn "What happened to $file?\n"
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The validate() routine takes a single multiline string consisting of
directives, each containing a filename plus a file test to try on it.
(The file test may also be a "cd", causing subsequent relative filenames
to be interpreted relative to that directory.)  After the file test
you may put C<|| die> to make it a fatal error if the file test fails.
The default is C<|| warn>.  The file test may optionally have a "!' prepended
to test for the opposite condition.  If you do a cd and then list some
relative filenames, you may want to indent them slightly for readability.
If you supply your own die() or warn() message, you can use $file to
interpolate the filename.

Filetests may be bunched:  "-rwx" tests for all of C<-r>, C<-w>, and C<-x>.
Only the first failed test of the bunch will produce a warning.

The routine returns the number of warnings issued.

=head1 AUTHOR

Unknown.  Revised by Paul Grassie <F<grassie@@perl.com>> in 2002.

=head1 HISTORY

File::CheckTree used to not display fatal error messages.
It used to count only those warnings produced by a generic C<|| warn>
(and not those in which the user supplied the message).  In addition,
the validate() routine would leave the user program in whatever
directory was last entered through the use of "cd" directives.
These bugs were fixed during the development of perl 5.8.
The first fixed version of File::CheckTree was 4.2.

# This module implements parsing of the text of an L<> formatting code as
# defined in perlpodspec.  It should be suitable for any POD formatter.  It
# exports only one function, parselink(), which returns the five-item parse
# defined in perlpodspec.
#
# Perl core hackers, please note that this module is also separately
# maintained outside of the Perl core as part of the podlators.  Please send
# me any patches at the address above in addition to sending them to the
# standard Perl mailing lists.

=head1 NAME

Pod::ParseLink - Parse an LE<lt>E<gt> formatting code in POD text

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pod::ParseLink;
    my ($text, $inferred, $name, $section, $type) = parselink ($link);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module only provides a single function, parselink(), which takes the
text of an LE<lt>E<gt> formatting code and parses it.  It returns the anchor
text for the link (if any was given), the anchor text possibly inferred from
the name and section, the name or URL, the section if any, and the type of
link.  The type will be one of 'url', 'pod', or 'man', indicating a URL, a
link to a POD page, or a link to a Unix manual page.

Parsing is implemented per L<perlpodspec>.  For backward compatibility,
links where there is no section and name contains spaces, or links where the
entirety of the link (except for the anchor text if given) is enclosed in
double-quotes are interpreted as links to a section (LE<lt>/sectionE<gt>).

The inferred anchor text is implemented per L<perlpodspec>:

    L<name>         =>  L<name|name>
    L</section>     =>  L<"section"|/section>
    L<name/section> =>  L<"section" in name|name/section>

The name may contain embedded EE<lt>E<gt> and ZE<lt>E<gt> formatting codes,
and the section, anchor text, and inferred anchor text may contain any
formatting codes.  Any double quotes around the section are removed as part
of the parsing, as is any leading or trailing whitespace.

If the text of the LE<lt>E<gt> escape is entirely enclosed in double quotes,
it's interpreted as a link to a section for backwards compatibility.

No attempt is made to resolve formatting codes.  This must be done after
calling parselink (since EE<lt>E<gt> formatting codes can be used to escape
characters that would otherwise be significant to the parser and resolving
them before parsing would result in an incorrect parse of a formatting code
like:

    L<verticalE<verbar>barE<sol>slash>

which should be interpreted as a link to the C<vertical|bar/slash> POD page
and not as a link to the C<slash> section of the C<bar> POD page with an
anchor text of C<vertical>.  Note that not only the anchor text will need to
have formatting codes expanded, but so will the target of the link (to deal
with EE<lt>E<gt> and ZE<lt>E<gt> formatting codes), and special handling of
the section may be necessary depending on whether the translator wants to
consider markup in sections to be significant when resolving links.  See
L<perlpodspec> for more information.

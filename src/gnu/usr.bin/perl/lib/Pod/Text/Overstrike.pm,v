=head1 NAME

Pod::Text::Overstrike - Convert POD data to formatted overstrike text

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pod::Text::Overstrike;
    my $parser = Pod::Text::Overstrike->new (sentence => 0, width => 78);

    # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
    $parser->parse_from_filehandle;

    # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.txt.
    $parser->parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.txt');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pod::Text::Overstrike is a simple subclass of Pod::Text that highlights
output text using overstrike sequences, in a manner similar to nroff.
Characters in bold text are overstruck (character, backspace, character) and
characters in underlined text are converted to overstruck underscores
(underscore, backspace, character).  This format was originally designed for
hardcopy terminals and/or lineprinters, yet is readable on softcopy (CRT)
terminals.

Overstruck text is best viewed by page-at-a-time programs that take
advantage of the terminal's B<stand-out> and I<underline> capabilities, such
as the less program on Unix.

Apart from the overstrike, it in all ways functions like Pod::Text.  See
L<Pod::Text> for details and available options.

=head1 BUGS

Currently, the outermost formatting instruction wins, so for example
underlined text inside a region of bold text is displayed as simply bold.
There may be some better approach possible.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Pod::Text>, L<Pod::Parser>

The current version of this module is always available from its web site at
L<http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/podlators/>.  It is also part of the
Perl core distribution as of 5.6.0.

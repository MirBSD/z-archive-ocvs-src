@==============================================================================
                  Release of version 0.78 of Filter::Simple
==============================================================================


NAME
    Filter::Simple - Simplified source filtering

SYNOPSIS
     # in MyFilter.pm:

	 package MyFilter;

	 use Filter::Simple;
	 
	 FILTER { ... };

	 # or just:
	 #
	 # use Filter::Simple sub { ... };


     # in user's code:

	 use MyFilter;

	 # this is filtered

	 no MyFilter;

	 # this is not


DESCRIPTION
    The Filter::Simple module provides a simplified interface to
    Filter::Util::Call; one that is sufficient for most common cases.

AUTHOR
    Damian Conway (damian@@conway.org)

    Copyright (c) 2000-2001, Damian Conway. All Rights Reserved.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

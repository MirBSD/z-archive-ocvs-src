# After this point it is safe to introduce lexicals
# However, one should not overdo it: leave as much control from outside as possible
#
# This file is automatically included if you do perl -d.
# It's probably not useful to include this yourself.
#
# Before venturing further into these twisty passages, it is 
# wise to read the perldebguts man page or risk the ire of dragons.
#
# Perl supplies the values for %sub.  It effectively inserts
# a &DB::DB(); in front of every place that can have a
# breakpoint. Instead of a subroutine call it calls &DB::sub with
# $DB::sub being the called subroutine. It also inserts a BEGIN
# {require 'perl5db.pl'} before the first line.
#
# After each `require'd file is compiled, but before it is executed, a
# call to DB::postponed($main::{'_<'.$filename}) is emulated. Here the
# $filename is the expanded name of the `require'd file (as found as
# value of %INC).
#
# Additional services from Perl interpreter:
#
# if caller() is called from the package DB, it provides some
# additional data.
#
# The array @@{$main::{'_<'.$filename}} (herein called @@dbline) is the
# line-by-line contents of $filename.
#
# The hash %{'_<'.$filename} (herein called %dbline) contains
# breakpoints and action (it is keyed by line number), and individual
# entries are settable (as opposed to the whole hash). Only true/false
# is important to the interpreter, though the values used by
# perl5db.pl have the form "$break_condition\0$action". Values are
# magical in numeric context.
#
# The scalar ${'_<'.$filename} contains $filename.
#
# Note that no subroutine call is possible until &DB::sub is defined
# (for subroutines defined outside of the package DB). In fact the same is
# true if $deep is not defined.

#
# At start reads $rcfile that may set important options.  This file
# may define a subroutine &afterinit that will be executed after the
# debugger is initialized.
#
# After $rcfile is read reads environment variable PERLDB_OPTS and parses
# it as a rest of `O ...' line in debugger prompt.
#
# The options that can be specified only at startup:
# [To set in $rcfile, call &parse_options("optionName=new_value").]
#
# TTY  - the TTY to use for debugging i/o.
#
# noTTY - if set, goes in NonStop mode.  On interrupt if TTY is not set
# uses the value of noTTY or "/tmp/perldbtty$$" to find TTY using
# Term::Rendezvous.  Current variant is to have the name of TTY in this
# file.
#
# ReadLine - If false, dummy ReadLine is used, so you can debug
# ReadLine applications.
#
# NonStop - if true, no i/o is performed until interrupt.
#
# LineInfo - file or pipe to print line number info to.  If it is a
# pipe, a short "emacs like" message is used.
#
# RemotePort - host:port to connect to on remote host for remote debugging.
#
# Example $rcfile: (delete leading hashes!)
#
# &parse_options("NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out");
# sub afterinit { $trace = 1; }
#
# The script will run without human intervention, putting trace
# information into db.out.  (If you interrupt it, you would better
# reset LineInfo to something "interactive"!)

# Enhanced by ilya@@math.ohio-state.edu (Ilya Zakharevich)

# modified Perl debugger, to be run from Emacs in perldb-mode
# Ray Lischner (uunet!mntgfx!lisch) as of 5 Nov 1990
# Johan Vromans -- upgrade to 4.0 pl 10
# Ilya Zakharevich -- patches after 5.001 (and some before ;-)

# Changelog:

# A lot of things changed after 0.94. First of all, core now informs
# debugger about entry into XSUBs, overloaded operators, tied operations,
# BEGIN and END. Handy with `O f=2'.

# This can make debugger a little bit too verbose, please be patient
# and report your problems promptly.

# Now the option frame has 3 values: 0,1,2.

# Note that if DESTROY returns a reference to the object (or object),
# the deletion of data may be postponed until the next function call,
# due to the need to examine the return value.

# Changes: 0.95: `v' command shows versions.
# Changes: 0.96: `v' command shows version of readline.
#	primitive completion works (dynamic variables, subs for `b' and `l',
#		options). Can `p %var'
#	Better help (`h <' now works). New commands <<, >>, {, {{.
#	{dump|print}_trace() coded (to be able to do it from <<cmd).
#	`c sub' documented.
#	At last enough magic combined to stop after the end of debuggee.
#	!! should work now (thanks to Emacs bracket matching an extra
#	`]' in a regexp is caught).
#	`L', `D' and `A' span files now (as documented).
#	Breakpoints in `require'd code are possible (used in `R').
#	Some additional words on internal work of debugger.
#	`b load filename' implemented.
#	`b postpone subr' implemented.
#	now only `q' exits debugger (overwritable on $inhibit_exit).
#	When restarting debugger breakpoints/actions persist.
#     Buglet: When restarting debugger only one breakpoint/action per 
#		autoloaded function persists.
# Changes: 0.97: NonStop will not stop in at_exit().
#	Option AutoTrace implemented.
#	Trace printed differently if frames are printed too.
#	new `inhibitExit' option.
#	printing of a very long statement interruptible.
# Changes: 0.98: New command `m' for printing possible methods
#	'l -' is a synonym for `-'.
#	Cosmetic bugs in printing stack trace.
#	`frame' & 8 to print "expanded args" in stack trace.
#	Can list/break in imported subs.
#	new `maxTraceLen' option.
#	frame & 4 and frame & 8 granted.
#	new command `m'
#	nonstoppable lines do not have `:' near the line number.
#	`b compile subname' implemented.
#	Will not use $` any more.
#	`-' behaves sane now.
# Changes: 0.99: Completion for `f', `m'.
#	`m' will remove duplicate names instead of duplicate functions.
#	`b load' strips trailing whitespace.
#	completion ignores leading `|'; takes into account current package
#	when completing a subroutine name (same for `l').
# Changes: 1.07: Many fixed by tchrist 13-March-2000
#   BUG FIXES:
#   + Added bare minimal security checks on perldb rc files, plus
#     comments on what else is needed.
#   + Fixed the ornaments that made "|h" completely unusable.
#     They are not used in print_help if they will hurt.  Strip pod
#     if we're paging to less.
#   + Fixed mis-formatting of help messages caused by ornaments
#     to restore Larry's original formatting.  
#   + Fixed many other formatting errors.  The code is still suboptimal, 
#     and needs a lot of work at restructuring.  It's also misindented
#     in many places.
#   + Fixed bug where trying to look at an option like your pager
#     shows "1".  
#   + Fixed some $? processing.  Note: if you use csh or tcsh, you will
#     lose.  You should consider shell escapes not using their shell,
#     or else not caring about detailed status.  This should really be
#     unified into one place, too.
#   + Fixed bug where invisible trailing whitespace on commands hoses you,
#     tricking Perl into thinking you weren't calling a debugger command!
#   + Fixed bug where leading whitespace on commands hoses you.  (One
#     suggests a leading semicolon or any other irrelevant non-whitespace
#     to indicate literal Perl code.)
#   + Fixed bugs that ate warnings due to wrong selected handle.
#   + Fixed a precedence bug on signal stuff.
#   + Fixed some unseemly wording.
#   + Fixed bug in help command trying to call perl method code.
#   + Fixed to call dumpvar from exception handler.  SIGPIPE killed us.
#   ENHANCEMENTS:
#   + Added some comments.  This code is still nasty spaghetti.
#   + Added message if you clear your pre/post command stacks which was
#     very easy to do if you just typed a bare >, <, or {.  (A command
#     without an argument should *never* be a destructive action; this
#     API is fundamentally screwed up; likewise option setting, which
#     is equally buggered.)
#   + Added command stack dump on argument of "?" for >, <, or {.
#   + Added a semi-built-in doc viewer command that calls man with the
#     proper %Config::Config path (and thus gets caching, man -k, etc),
#     or else perldoc on obstreperous platforms.
#   + Added to and rearranged the help information.
#   + Detected apparent misuse of { ... } to declare a block; this used
#     to work but now is a command, and mysteriously gave no complaint.
#
# Changes: 1.08: Apr 25, 2001  Jon Eveland <jweveland@@yahoo.com>
#   BUG FIX:
#   + This patch to perl5db.pl cleans up formatting issues on the help
#     summary (h h) screen in the debugger.  Mostly columnar alignment
#     issues, plus converted the printed text to use all spaces, since
#     tabs don't seem to help much here.
#
# Changes: 1.09: May 19, 2001  Ilya Zakharevich <ilya@@math.ohio-state.edu>
#   0) Minor bugs corrected;
#   a) Support for auto-creation of new TTY window on startup, either
#      unconditionally, or if started as a kid of another debugger session;
#   b) New `O'ption CreateTTY
#       I<CreateTTY>       bits control attempts to create a new TTY on events:
#                          1: on fork()   2: debugger is started inside debugger
#                          4: on startup
#   c) Code to auto-create a new TTY window on OS/2 (currently one
#      extra window per session - need named pipes to have more...);
#   d) Simplified interface for custom createTTY functions (with a backward
#      compatibility hack); now returns the TTY name to use; return of ''
#      means that the function reset the I/O handles itself;
#   d') Better message on the semantic of custom createTTY function;
#   e) Convert the existing code to create a TTY into a custom createTTY
#      function;
#   f) Consistent support for TTY names of the form "TTYin,TTYout";
#   g) Switch line-tracing output too to the created TTY window;
#   h) make `b fork' DWIM with CORE::GLOBAL::fork;
#   i) High-level debugger API cmd_*():
#      cmd_b_load($filenamepart)            # b load filenamepart
#      cmd_b_line($lineno [, $cond])        # b lineno [cond]
#      cmd_b_sub($sub [, $cond])            # b sub [cond]
#      cmd_stop()                           # Control-C
#      cmd_d($lineno)                       # d lineno (B)
#      The cmd_*() API returns FALSE on failure; in this case it outputs
#      the error message to the debugging output.
#   j) Low-level debugger API
#      break_on_load($filename)             # b load filename
#      @@files = report_break_on_load()      # List files with load-breakpoints
#      breakable_line_in_filename($name, $from [, $to])
#                                           # First breakable line in the
#                                           # range $from .. $to.  $to defaults
#                                           # to $from, and may be less than $to
#      breakable_line($from [, $to])        # Same for the current file
#      break_on_filename_line($name, $lineno [, $cond])
#                                           # Set breakpoint,$cond defaults to 1
#      break_on_filename_line_range($name, $from, $to [, $cond])
#                                           # As above, on the first
#                                           # breakable line in range
#      break_on_line($lineno [, $cond])     # As above, in the current file
#      break_subroutine($sub [, $cond])     # break on the first breakable line
#      ($name, $from, $to) = subroutine_filename_lines($sub)
#                                           # The range of lines of the text
#      The low-level API returns TRUE on success, and die()s on failure.

=head1 NAME 

C<perl5db.pl> - the perl debugger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl -d  your_Perl_script

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<perl5db.pl> is the perl debugger. It is loaded automatically by Perl when
you invoke a script with C<perl -d>. This documentation tries to outline the
structure and services provided by C<perl5db.pl>, and to describe how you
can use them.

=head1 GENERAL NOTES

The debugger can look pretty forbidding to many Perl programmers. There are
a number of reasons for this, many stemming out of the debugger's history.

When the debugger was first written, Perl didn't have a lot of its nicer
features - no references, no lexical variables, no closures, no object-oriented
programming. So a lot of the things one would normally have done using such
features was done using global variables, globs and the C<local()> operator 
in creative ways.

Some of these have survived into the current debugger; a few of the more
interesting and still-useful idioms are noted in this section, along with notes
on the comments themselves.

=head2 Why not use more lexicals?

Experienced Perl programmers will note that the debugger code tends to use
mostly package globals rather than lexically-scoped variables. This is done
to allow a significant amount of control of the debugger from outside the
debugger itself.       

Unfortunately, though the variables are accessible, they're not well
documented, so it's generally been a decision that hasn't made a lot of
difference to most users. Where appropriate, comments have been added to
make variables more accessible and usable, with the understanding that these
i<are> debugger internals, and are therefore subject to change. Future
development should probably attempt to replace the globals with a well-defined
API, but for now, the variables are what we've got.

=head2 Automated variable stacking via C<local()>

As you may recall from reading C<perlfunc>, the C<local()> operator makes a 
temporary copy of a variable in the current scope. When the scope ends, the
old copy is restored. This is often used in the debugger to handle the 
automatic stacking of variables during recursive calls:

     sub foo {
        local $some_global++;

        # Do some stuff, then ...
        return;
     }

What happens is that on entry to the subroutine, C<$some_global> is localized,
then altered. When the subroutine returns, Perl automatically undoes the 
localization, restoring the previous value. Voila, automatic stack management.

The debugger uses this trick a I<lot>. Of particular note is C<DB::eval>, 
which lets the debugger get control inside of C<eval>'ed code. The debugger
localizes a saved copy of C<$@@> inside the subroutine, which allows it to
keep C<$@@> safe until it C<DB::eval> returns, at which point the previous
value of C<$@@> is restored. This makes it simple (well, I<simpler>) to keep 
track of C<$@@> inside C<eval>s which C<eval> other C<eval's>.

In any case, watch for this pattern. It occurs fairly often.

=head2 The C<^> trick

This is used to cleverly reverse the sense of a logical test depending on 
the value of an auxiliary variable. For instance, the debugger's C<S>
(search for subroutines by pattern) allows you to negate the pattern 
like this:

   # Find all non-'foo' subs:
   S !/foo/      

Boolean algebra states that the truth table for XOR looks like this:

=over 4

=item * 0 ^ 0 = 0 

(! not present and no match) --> false, don't print

=item * 0 ^ 1 = 1 

(! not present and matches) --> true, print

=item * 1 ^ 0 = 1 

(! present and no match) --> true, print

=item * 1 ^ 1 = 0 

(! present and matches) --> false, don't print

=back

As you can see, the first pair applies when C<!> isn't supplied, and
the second pair applies when it isn't. The XOR simply allows us to
compact a more complicated if-then-elseif-else into a more elegant 
(but perhaps overly clever) single test. After all, it needed this
explanation...

=head2 FLAGS, FLAGS, FLAGS

There is a certain C programming legacy in the debugger. Some variables,
such as C<$single>, C<$trace>, and C<$frame>, have "magical" values composed
of 1, 2, 4, etc. (powers of 2) OR'ed together. This allows several pieces
of state to be stored independently in a single scalar. 

A test like

    if ($scalar & 4) ...

is checking to see if the appropriate bit is on. Since each bit can be 
"addressed" independently in this way, C<$scalar> is acting sort of like
an array of bits. Obviously, since the contents of C<$scalar> are just a 
bit-pattern, we can save and restore it easily (it will just look like
a number).

The problem, is of course, that this tends to leave magic numbers scattered
all over your program whenever a bit is set, cleared, or checked. So why do 
it?

=over 4


=item * First, doing an arithmetical or bitwise operation on a scalar is
just about the fastest thing you can do in Perl: C<use constant> actually
creates a subroutine call, and array hand hash lookups are much slower. Is
this over-optimization at the expense of readability? Possibly, but the 
debugger accesses these  variables a I<lot>. Any rewrite of the code will
probably have to benchmark alternate implementations and see which is the
best balance of readability and speed, and then document how it actually 
works.

=item * Second, it's very easy to serialize a scalar number. This is done in 
the restart code; the debugger state variables are saved in C<%ENV> and then
restored when the debugger is restarted. Having them be just numbers makes
this trivial. 

=item * Third, some of these variables are being shared with the Perl core 
smack in the middle of the interpreter's execution loop. It's much faster for 
a C program (like the interpreter) to check a bit in a scalar than to access 
several different variables (or a Perl array).

=back

=head2 What are those C<XXX> comments for?

Any comment containing C<XXX> means that the comment is either somewhat
speculative - it's not exactly clear what a given variable or chunk of 
code is doing, or that it is incomplete - the basics may be clear, but the
subtleties are not completely documented.

Send in a patch if you can clear up, fill out, or clarify an C<XXX>.

=head1 DATA STRUCTURES MAINTAINED BY CORE         

There are a number of special data structures provided to the debugger by
the Perl interpreter.

The array C<@@{$main::{'_<'.$filename}}> (aliased locally to C<@@dbline> via glob
assignment) contains the text from C<$filename>, with each element
corresponding to a single line of C<$filename>.

The hash C<%{'_<'.$filename}> (aliased locally to C<%dbline> via glob 
assignment) contains breakpoints and actions.  The keys are line numbers; 
you can set individual values, but not the whole hash. The Perl interpreter 
uses this hash to determine where breakpoints have been set. Any true value is
considered to be a breakpoint; C<perl5db.pl> uses "$break_condition\0$action".
Values are magical in numeric context: 1 if the line is breakable, 0 if not.

The scalar ${'_<'.$filename} contains $filename  XXX What?

=head1 DEBUGGER STARTUP

When C<perl5db.pl> starts, it reads an rcfile (C<perl5db.ini> for
non-interactive sessions, C<.perldb> for interactive ones) that can set a number
of options. In addition, this file may define a subroutine C<&afterinit>
that will be executed (in the debugger's context) after the debugger has 
initialized itself.

Next, it checks the C<PERLDB_OPTS> environment variable and treats its 
contents as the argument of a debugger <C<O> command.

=head2 STARTUP-ONLY OPTIONS

The following options can only be specified at startup.
To set them in your rcfile, add a call to
C<&parse_options("optionName=new_value")>.

=over 4

=item * TTY 

the TTY to use for debugging i/o.

=item * noTTY 

if set, goes in NonStop mode.  On interrupt, if TTY is not set,
uses the value of noTTY or "/tmp/perldbtty$$" to find TTY using
Term::Rendezvous.  Current variant is to have the name of TTY in this
file.

=item * ReadLine 

If false, a dummy  ReadLine is used, so you can debug
ReadLine applications.

=item * NonStop 

if true, no i/o is performed until interrupt.

=item * LineInfo 

file or pipe to print line number info to.  If it is a
pipe, a short "emacs like" message is used.

=item * RemotePort 

host:port to connect to on remote host for remote debugging.

=back

=head3 SAMPLE RCFILE

 &parse_options("NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out");
  sub afterinit { $trace = 1; }

The script will run without human intervention, putting trace
information into C<db.out>.  (If you interrupt it, you had better
reset C<LineInfo> to something "interactive"!)

=head1 INTERNALS DESCRIPTION

=head2 DEBUGGER INTERFACE VARIABLES

Perl supplies the values for C<%sub>.  It effectively inserts
a C<&DB'DB();> in front of each place that can have a
breakpoint. At each subroutine call, it calls C<&DB::sub> with
C<$DB::sub> set to the called subroutine. It also inserts a C<BEGIN
{require 'perl5db.pl'}> before the first line.

After each C<require>d file is compiled, but before it is executed, a
call to C<&DB::postponed($main::{'_<'.$filename})> is done. C<$filename>
is the expanded name of the C<require>d file (as found via C<%INC>).

=head3 IMPORTANT INTERNAL VARIABLES

=head4 C<$CreateTTY>

Used to control when the debugger will attempt to acquire another TTY to be
used for input. 

=over   

=item * 1 -  on C<fork()>

=item * 2 - debugger is started inside debugger

=item * 4 -  on startup

=back

=head4 C<$doret>

The value -2 indicates that no return value should be printed.
Any other positive value causes C<DB::sub> to print return values.

=head4 C<$evalarg>

The item to be eval'ed by C<DB::eval>. Used to prevent messing with the current
contents of C<@@_> when C<DB::eval> is called.

=head4 C<$frame>

Determines what messages (if any) will get printed when a subroutine (or eval)
is entered or exited. 

=over 4

=item * 0 -  No enter/exit messages

=item * 1 - Print "entering" messages on subroutine entry

=item * 2 - Adds exit messages on subroutine exit. If no other flag is on, acts like 1+2.

=item * 4 - Extended messages: C<in|out> I<context>=I<fully-qualified sub name> from I<file>:I<line>>. If no other flag is on, acts like 1+4.

=item * 8 - Adds parameter information to messages, and overloaded stringify and tied FETCH is enabled on the printed arguments. Ignored if C<4> is not on.

=item * 16 - Adds C<I<context> return from I<subname>: I<value>> messages on subroutine/eval exit. Ignored if C<4> is is not on.

=back

To get everything, use C<$frame=30> (or C<o f-30> as a debugger command).
The debugger internally juggles the value of C<$frame> during execution to
protect external modules that the debugger uses from getting traced.

=head4 C<$level>

Tracks current debugger nesting level. Used to figure out how many 
C<E<lt>E<gt>> pairs to surround the line number with when the debugger 
outputs a prompt. Also used to help determine if the program has finished
during command parsing.

=head4 C<$onetimeDump>

Controls what (if anything) C<DB::eval()> will print after evaluating an
expression.

=over 4

=item * C<undef> - don't print anything

=item * C<dump> - use C<dumpvar.pl> to display the value returned

=item * C<methods> - print the methods callable on the first item returned

=back

=head4 C<$onetimeDumpDepth>

Controls how far down C<dumpvar.pl> will go before printing '...' while
dumping a structure. Numeric. If C<undef>, print all levels.

=head4 C<$signal>

Used to track whether or not an C<INT> signal has been detected. C<DB::DB()>,
which is called before every statement, checks this and puts the user into
command mode if it finds C<$signal> set to a true value.

=head4 C<$single>

Controls behavior during single-stepping. Stacked in C<@@stack> on entry to
each subroutine; popped again at the end of each subroutine.

=over 4 

=item * 0 - run continuously.

=item * 1 - single-step, go into subs. The 's' command.

=item * 2 - single-step, don't go into subs. The 'n' command.

=item * 4 - print current sub depth (turned on to force this when "too much
recursion" occurs.

=back

=head4 C<$trace>

Controls the output of trace information. 

=over 4

=item * 1 - The C<t> command was entered to turn on tracing (every line executed is printed)

=item * 2 - watch expressions are active

=item * 4 - user defined a C<watchfunction()> in C<afterinit()>

=back

=head4 C<$slave_editor>

1 if C<LINEINFO> was directed to a pipe; 0 otherwise.

=head4 C<@@cmdfhs>

Stack of filehandles that C<DB::readline()> will read commands from.
Manipulated by the debugger's C<source> command and C<DB::readline()> itself.

=head4 C<@@dbline>

Local alias to the magical line array, C<@@{$main::{'_<'.$filename}}> , 
supplied by the Perl interpreter to the debugger. Contains the source.

=head4 C<@@old_watch>

Previous values of watch expressions. First set when the expression is
entered; reset whenever the watch expression changes.

=head4 C<@@saved>

Saves important globals (C<$@@>, C<$!>, C<$^E>, C<$,>, C<$/>, C<$\>, C<$^W>)
so that the debugger can substitute safe values while it's running, and
restore them when it returns control.

=head4 C<@@stack>

Saves the current value of C<$single> on entry to a subroutine.
Manipulated by the C<c> command to turn off tracing in all subs above the
current one.

=head4 C<@@to_watch>

The 'watch' expressions: to be evaluated before each line is executed.

=head4 C<@@typeahead>

The typeahead buffer, used by C<DB::readline>.

=head4 C<%alias>

Command aliases. Stored as character strings to be substituted for a command
entered.

=head4 C<%break_on_load>

Keys are file names, values are 1 (break when this file is loaded) or undef
(don't break when it is loaded).

=head4 C<%dbline>

Keys are line numbers, values are "condition\0action". If used in numeric
context, values are 0 if not breakable, 1 if breakable, no matter what is
in the actual hash entry.

=head4 C<%had_breakpoints>

Keys are file names; values are bitfields:

=over 4 

=item * 1 - file has a breakpoint in it.

=item * 2 - file has an action in it.

=back

A zero or undefined value means this file has neither.

=head4 C<%option>

Stores the debugger options. These are character string values.

=head4 C<%postponed>

Saves breakpoints for code that hasn't been compiled yet.
Keys are subroutine names, values are:

=over 4

=item * 'compile' - break when this sub is compiled

=item * 'break +0 if <condition>' - break (conditionally) at the start of this routine. The condition will be '1' if no condition was specified.

=back

=head4 C<%postponed_file>

This hash keeps track of breakpoints that need to be set for files that have
not yet been compiled. Keys are filenames; values are references to hashes.
Each of these hashes is keyed by line number, and its values are breakpoint
definitions ("condition\0action").

=head1 DEBUGGER INITIALIZATION

The debugger's initialization actually jumps all over the place inside this
package. This is because there are several BEGIN blocks (which of course 
execute immediately) spread through the code. Why is that? 

The debugger needs to be able to change some things and set some things up 
before the debugger code is compiled; most notably, the C<$deep> variable that
C<DB::sub> uses to tell when a program has recursed deeply. In addition, the
debugger has to turn off warnings while the debugger code is compiled, but then
restore them to their original setting before the program being debugged begins
executing.

The first C<BEGIN> block simply turns off warnings by saving the current
setting of C<$^W> and then setting it to zero. The second one initializes
the debugger variables that are needed before the debugger begins executing.
The third one puts C<$^X> back to its former value. 

We'll detail the second C<BEGIN> block later; just remember that if you need
to initialize something before the debugger starts really executing, that's
where it has to go.

=head1 DEBUGGER ROUTINES

=head2 C<DB::eval()>

This function replaces straight C<eval()> inside the debugger; it simplifies
the process of evaluating code in the user's context.

The code to be evaluated is passed via the package global variable 
C<$DB::evalarg>; this is done to avoid fiddling with the contents of C<@@_>.

We preserve the current settings of X<C<$trace>>, X<C<$single>>, and X<C<$^D>>;
add the X<C<$usercontext>> (that's the preserved values of C<$@@>, C<$!>,
C<$^E>, C<$,>, C<$/>, C<$\>, and C<$^W>, grabbed when C<DB::DB> got control,
and the user's current package) and a add a newline before we do the C<eval()>.
This causes the proper context to be used when the eval is actually done.
Afterward, we restore C<$trace>, C<$single>, and C<$^D>.

Next we need to handle C<$@@> without getting confused. We save C<$@@> in a
local lexical, localize C<$saved[0]> (which is where C<save()> will put 
C<$@@>), and then call C<save()> to capture C<$@@>, C<$!>, C<$^E>, C<$,>, 
C<$/>, C<$\>, and C<$^W>) and set C<$,>, C<$/>, C<$\>, and C<$^W> to values
considered sane by the debugger. If there was an C<eval()> error, we print 
it on the debugger's output. If X<C<$onetimedump>> is defined, we call 
X<C<dumpit>> if it's set to 'dump', or X<C<methods>> if it's set to 
'methods'. Setting it to something else causes the debugger to do the eval 
but not print the result - handy if you want to do something else with it 
(the "watch expressions" code does this to get the value of the watch
expression but not show it unless it matters).

In any case, we then return the list of output from C<eval> to the caller, 
and unwinding restores the former version of C<$@@> in C<@@saved> as well 
(the localization of C<$saved[0]> goes away at the end of this scope).

=head3 Parameters and variables influencing execution of DB::eval()

C<DB::eval> isn't parameterized in the standard way; this is to keep the
debugger's calls to C<DB::eval()> from mucking with C<@@_>, among other things.
The variables listed below influence C<DB::eval()>'s execution directly. 

=over 4

=item C<$evalarg> - the thing to actually be eval'ed

=item C<$trace> - Current state of execution tracing (see X<$trace>)

=item C<$single> - Current state of single-stepping (see X<$single>)        

=item C<$onetimeDump> - what is to be displayed after the evaluation 

=item C<$onetimeDumpDepth> - how deep C<dumpit()> should go when dumping results

=back

The following variables are altered by C<DB::eval()> during its execution. They
are "stacked" via C<local()>, enabling recursive calls to C<DB::eval()>. 

=over 4

=item C<@@res> - used to capture output from actual C<eval>.

=item C<$otrace> - saved value of C<$trace>.

=item C<$osingle> - saved value of C<$single>.      

=item C<$od> - saved value of C<$^D>.

=item C<$saved[0]> - saved value of C<$@@>.

=item $\ - for output of C<$@@> if there is an evaluation error.      

=back

=head3 The problem of lexicals

The context of C<DB::eval()> presents us with some problems. Obviously,
we want to be 'sandboxed' away from the debugger's internals when we do
the eval, but we need some way to control how punctuation variables and
debugger globals are used. 

We can't use local, because the code inside C<DB::eval> can see localized
variables; and we can't use C<my> either for the same reason. The code
in this routine compromises and uses C<my>.

After this routine is over, we don't have user code executing in the debugger's
context, so we can use C<my> freely.

# Changes: 0.94
#   + A lot of things changed after 0.94. First of all, core now informs
#     debugger about entry into XSUBs, overloaded operators, tied operations,
#     BEGIN and END. Handy with `O f=2'.
#   + This can make debugger a little bit too verbose, please be patient
#     and report your problems promptly.
#   + Now the option frame has 3 values: 0,1,2. XXX Document!
#   + Note that if DESTROY returns a reference to the object (or object),
#     the deletion of data may be postponed until the next function call,
#     due to the need to examine the return value.
#
# Changes: 0.95
#   + `v' command shows versions.
#
# Changes: 0.96 
#   + `v' command shows version of readline.
#     primitive completion works (dynamic variables, subs for `b' and `l',
#     options). Can `p %var'
#   + Better help (`h <' now works). New commands <<, >>, {, {{.
#     {dump|print}_trace() coded (to be able to do it from <<cmd).
#   + `c sub' documented.
#   + At last enough magic combined to stop after the end of debuggee.
#   + !! should work now (thanks to Emacs bracket matching an extra
#     `]' in a regexp is caught).
#   + `L', `D' and `A' span files now (as documented).
#   + Breakpoints in `require'd code are possible (used in `R').
#   +  Some additional words on internal work of debugger.
#   + `b load filename' implemented.
#   + `b postpone subr' implemented.
#   + now only `q' exits debugger (overwritable on $inhibit_exit).
#   + When restarting debugger breakpoints/actions persist.
#   + Buglet: When restarting debugger only one breakpoint/action per 
#             autoloaded function persists.

=head1 DEBUGGER INITIALIZATION

The debugger starts up in phases.

=head2 BASIC SETUP

First, it initializes the environment it wants to run in: turning off
warnings during its own compilation, defining variables which it will need
to avoid warnings later, setting itself up to not exit when the program
terminates, and defaulting to printing return values for the C<r> command.

=head1 OPTION PROCESSING
a408 95
The debugger's options are actually spread out over the debugger itself and 
C<dumpvar.pl>; some of these are variables to be set, while others are 
subs to be called with a value. To try to make this a little easier to
manage, the debugger uses a few data structures to define what options
are legal and how they are to be processed.

First, the C<@@options> array defines the I<names> of all the options that
are to be accepted.

=cut

@@options = qw(
             CommandSet
             hashDepth    arrayDepth    dumpDepth
             DumpDBFiles  DumpPackages  DumpReused

             PrintRet     UsageOnly     frame
             AutoTrace    TTY           noTTY 
             ReadLine     NonStop       LineInfo 
             maxTraceLen  recallCommand ShellBang
             pager        tkRunning     ornaments
             signalLevel  warnLevel     dieLevel 
             inhibit_exit ImmediateStop bareStringify 
             CreateTTY    RemotePort    windowSize
           );

=pod

Second, C<optionVars> lists the variables that each option uses to save its
state.

=cut

%optionVars = (
    hashDepth     => \$dumpvar::hashDepth,
    arrayDepth    => \$dumpvar::arrayDepth,
    CommandSet    => \$CommandSet,

The pager to be used is needed next. We try to get it from the
environment first.  if it's not defined there, we try to find it in
the Perl C<Config.pm>.  If it's not there, we default to C<more>. We
then call the C<pager()> function to save the pager name.

We set up the command to be used to access the man pages, the command
recall character ("!" unless otherwise defined) and the shell escape

=head2 SETTING UP THE DEBUGGER GREETING

The debugger 'greeting'  helps to inform the user how many debuggers are
running, and whether the current debugger is the primary or a child.

If we are the primary, we just hang onto our pid so we'll have it when
or if we start a child debugger. If we are a child, we'll set things up
so we'll have a unique greeting and so the parent will give us our own
TTY later.

We save the current contents of the C<PERLDB_PIDS> environment variable
because we mess around with it. We'll also need to hang onto it because
we'll need it if we restart.

Child debuggers make a label out of the current PID structure recorded in
PERLDB_PIDS plus the new PID. They also mark themselves as not having a TTY
yet so the parent will give them one later via C<resetterm()>.

=cut

# Save the current contents of the environment; we're about to 
# much with it. We'll need this if we have to restart.

=head2 READING THE RC FILE

The debugger will read a file of initialization options if supplied. If    
running interactively, this is C<.perldb>; if not, it's C<perldb.ini>.

=cut      

# As noted, this test really doesn't check accurately that the debugger
# is running at a terminal or not.

=head2 RESTART PROCESSING

This section handles the restart command. When the C<R> command is invoked, it
tries to capture all of the state it can into environment variables, and
then sets C<PERLDB_RESTART>. When we start executing again, we check to see
if C<PERLDB_RESTART> is there; if so, we reload all the information that
the R command stuffed into the environment variables.

  PERLDB_RESTART   - flag only, contains no restart data itself.       
  PERLDB_HIST      - command history, if it's available
  PERLDB_ON_LOAD   - breakpoints set by the rc file
  PERLDB_POSTPONE  - subs that have been loaded/not executed, and have actions
  PERLDB_VISITED   - files that had breakpoints
  PERLDB_FILE_...  - breakpoints for a file
  PERLDB_OPT       - active options
  PERLDB_INC       - the original @@INC
  PERLDB_PRETYPE   - preprompt debugger actions
  PERLDB_PRE       - preprompt Perl code
  PERLDB_POST      - post-prompt Perl code
  PERLDB_TYPEAHEAD - typeahead captured by readline()

=head2 SETTING UP THE TERMINAL

If there is a TTY, we have to determine who it belongs to before we can
proceed. If this is a slave editor or graphical debugger (denoted by
the first command-line switch being '-emacs'), we shift this off and
set C<$rl> to 0 (XXX ostensibly to do straight reads).

    # If so, don't use readline, and set $slave_editor = 1.

We then determine what the console should be on various systems:

=item * MacOS - use C<Dev:Console:Perl Debug> if this is the MPW version; C<Dev:
Console> if not. (Note that Mac OS X returns 'darwin', not 'MacOS'. Also note that the debugger doesn't do anything special for 'darwin'. Maybe it should.)

for those (Windows using a slave editor/graphical debugger, NetWare, OS/2
with a slave editor, Epoc).

If there is a TTY hanging around from a parent, we use that as the console.

=cut

    $console = $tty if defined $tty;

=head2 SOCKET HANDLING   

The debugger is capable of opening a socket and carrying out a debugging
session over the socket.

If C<RemotePort> was defined in the options, the debugger assumes that it
should try to start a debugging session on that port. It builds the socket
and then tries to connect the input and output filehandles to it.

=cut

    # Handle socket stuff.
    if (defined $remoteport) {
        # If RemotePort was defined in the options, connect input and output
        # to the socket.

            Timeout  => '10',

            Proto    => 'tcp',

        if (!$OUT) { die "Unable to connect to remote host: $remoteport\n"; }
        $IN = $OUT;
    } ## end if (defined $remoteport)

=pod

If no C<RemotePort> was defined, and we want to create a TTY on startup,
this is probably a situation where multiple debuggers are running (for example,
a backticked command that starts up another debugger). We create a new IN and
OUT filehandle, and do the necessary mojo to create a new TTY if we know how
and if we can.

=cut

    # Non-socket.
    else {
        # Two debuggers running (probably a system or a backtick that invokes
        # the debugger itself under the running one). create a new IN and OUT

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 DB

This gigantic subroutine is the heart of the debugger. Called before every
statement, its job is to determine if a breakpoint has been reached, and
stop if so; read commands from the user, parse them, and execute
them, and hen send execution off to the next statement.

Note that the order in which the commands are processed is very important;
some commands earlier in the loop will actually alter the C<$cmd> variable
to create other commands to be executed later. This is all highly "optimized"
but can be confusing. Check the comments for each C<$cmd ... && do {}> to
see what's happening in any given command.

=head2 C<watchfunction()>

C<watchfunction()> is a function that can be defined by the user; it is a
function which will be run on each entry to C<DB::DB>; it gets the 
current package, filename, and line as its parameters.

The watchfunction can do anything it likes; it is executing in the 
debugger's context, so it has access to all of the debugger's internal
data structures and functions.

C<watchfunction()> can control the debugger's actions. Any of the following
will cause the debugger to return control to the user's program after
C<watchfunction()> executes:

=over 4 

=item * Returning a false value from the C<watchfunction()> itself.

=item * Altering C<$single> to a false value.

=item * Altering C<$signal> to a false value.

check for C<watchfunction()>. This can be done with

has fallen off the end, we set things up so that entering further commands
won't cause trouble, and we say that the program is over.

=head2 WHERE ARE WE?

XXX Relocate this section?

The debugger normally shows the line corresponding to the current line of
execution. Sometimes, though, we want to see the next line, or to move elsewhere
in the file. This is done via the C<$incr>, C<$start>, and C<$max> variables.

C<$incr> controls by how many lines the "current" line should move forward
after a command is executed. If set to -1, this indicates that the "current"
line shouldn't change.

C<$start> is the "current" line. It is used for things like knowing where to
move forwards or backwards from when doing an C<L> or C<-> command.

C<$max> tells the debugger where the last line of the current file is. It's
used to terminate loops most often.

=head2 THE COMMAND LOOP

Most of C<DB::DB> is actually a command parsing and dispatch loop. It comes
in two parts:

=over 4

=item * The outer part of the loop, starting at the C<CMD> label. This loop
reads a command and then executes it.

=item * The inner part of the loop, starting at the C<PIPE> label. This part
is wholly contained inside the C<CMD> block and only executes a command.
Used to handle commands running inside a pager.

=back

So why have two labels to restart the loop? Because sometimes, it's easier to
have a command I<generate> another command and then re-execute the loop to do
the new command. This is faster, but perhaps a bit more convoluted.

=cut

        # The big command dispatch loop. It keeps running until the
        # user yields up control again.
        #
        # If we have a terminal for input, and we get something back
        # from readline(), keep on processing.
      CMD:
        while (
            # We have a terminal, or can get one ...
            ($term || &setterm),
            # ... and it belogs to this PID or we get one for this PID ...
            ($term_pid == $$ or resetterm(1)),
            # ... and we got a line of command input ...
            defined(
                $cmd = &readline(
                    "$pidprompt  DB" . ('<' x $level) . ($#hist + 1) .
                      ('>' x $level) . " "

                redo CMD;
            };

=head4 The null command

A newline entered by itself means "re-execute the last command". We grab the
command out of C<$laststep> (where it was recorded previously), and copy it
back into C<$cmd> to be executed below. If there wasn't any previous command,
we'll do nothing below (no command will match). If there was, we also save it
in the command history and fall through to allow the command parsing to pick
it up.

=cut

            # Empty input means repeat the last command.
            $cmd =~ /^$/ && ($cmd = $laststep);
            push (@@hist, $cmd) if length($cmd) > 1;


          # This is a restart point for commands that didn't arrive
          # via direct user input. It allows us to 'redo PIPE' to
          # re-execute command processing without reading a new command.
          PIPE: {
                $cmd =~ s/^\s+//s;    # trim annoying leading whitespace
                $cmd =~ s/\s+$//s;    # trim annoying trailing whitespace
                ($i) = split (/\s+/, $cmd);

=head3 COMMAND ALIASES

The debugger can create aliases for commands (these are stored in the
C<%alias> hash). Before a command is executed, the command loop looks it up
in the alias hash and substitutes the contents of the alias for the command,
completely replacing it.

=cut

                # See if there's an alias for the command, and set it up if so.
                if ($alias{$i}) {
                    # Squelch signal handling; we want to keep control here
                    # if something goes loco during the alias eval.
                    local $SIG{__DIE__};
                    local $SIG{__WARN__};

                    # This is a command, so we eval it in the DEBUGGER's
                    # scope! Otherwise, we can't see the special debugger
                    # variables, or get to the debugger's subs. (Well, we
                    # _could_, but why make it even more complicated?)
                    eval "\$cmd =~ $alias{$i}";
                    if ($@@) {
                        local $\ = '';
                        print $OUT "Couldn't evaluate `$i' alias: $@@";
                        next CMD;
                    }
                } ## end if ($alias{$i})

=head3 MAIN-LINE COMMANDS

All of these commands work up to and after the program being debugged has
terminated. 

=head4 C<q> - quit

Quit the debugger. This entails setting the C<$fall_off_end> flag, so we don't 
try to execute further, cleaning any restart-related stuff out of the

In Perl 5.8.0, a realignment of the commands was done to fix up a number of
problems, most notably that the default case of several commands destroying
the user's work in setting watchpoints, actions, etc. We wanted, however, to
retain the old commands for those who were used to using them or who preferred
them. At this point, we check for the new commands and call C<cmd_wrapper> to
deal with them instead of processing them in-line.

=cut

=head3 COMMANDS NOT WORKING AFTER PROGRAM ENDS

All of the commands below this point don't work after the program being
debugged has ended. All of them check to see if the program has ended; this
allows the commands to be relocated without worrying about a 'line of
demarcation' above which commands can be entered anytime, and below which
they can't.

=head4 C<n> - single step, but don't trace down into subs

Done by setting C<$single> to 2, which forces subs to execute straight through
when entered (see X<DB::sub>). We also save the C<n> command in C<$laststep>,
so a null command knows what to re-execute. 

=cut

                # n - next 
                $cmd =~ /^n$/ && do {
                    end_report(), next CMD if $finished and $level <= 1;
                    # Single step, but don't enter subs.
                    $single   = 2;
                    # Save for empty command (repeat last).
                    $laststep = $cmd;
                    last CMD;
                };

=head4 C<s> - single-step, entering subs

Sets C<$single> to 1, which causes X<DB::sub> to continue tracing inside     
subs. Also saves C<s> as C<$lastcmd>.

=cut

                # s - single step.
                $cmd =~ /^s$/ && do {
                    # Get out and restart the command loop if program
                    # has finished.
                    end_report(), next CMD if $finished and $level <= 1;
                    # Single step should enter subs.
                    $single   = 1;
                    # Save for empty command (repeat last).
                    $laststep = $cmd;
                    last CMD;
                };

=head4 C<c> - run continuously, setting an optional breakpoint

Most of the code for this command is taken up with locating the optional
breakpoint, which is either a subroutine name or a line number. We set
the appropriate one-time-break in C<@@dbline> and then turn off single-stepping
in this and all call levels above this one.

                    # executing already.
                    end_report(), next CMD if $finished and $level <= 1;

                    # Capture the place to put a one-time break.
                    $subname = $i = $1;

                    #  Probably not needed, since we finish an interactive

                    # out, we'll just leave that to speculation for now.

                    # If the "subname" isn't all digits, we'll assume it
                    # is a subroutine name, and try to find it.

=head4 C<r> - return from a subroutine

For C<r> to work properly, the debugger has to stop execution again
immediately after the return is executed. This is done by forcing
single-stepping to be on in the call level above the current one. If
we are printing return values when a C<r> is executed, set C<$doret>
appropriately, and force us out of the command loop.

=cut

=head4 C<R> - restart

Restarting the debugger is a complex operation that occurs in several phases.
First, we try to reconstruct the command line that was used to invoke Perl

After the command line  has been reconstructed, the next step is to save
the debugger's status in environment variables. The C<DB::set_list> routine
is used to save aggregate variables (both hashes and arrays); scalars are
just popped into environment variables directly.

=cut

                    # save that in the environment.

                        ? $term->GetHistory
                        : @@hist);

                    # session (i.e., the debugger had magic hashes
                    # corresponding to them) and stick them in the environment.

The most complex part of this is the saving of all of the breakpoints. They
can live in an awful lot of places, and we have to go through all of them,
find the breakpoints, and then save them in the appropriate environment
variable via C<DB::set_list>.

=head4 C<|, ||> - pipe output through the pager.

FOR C<|>, we save C<OUT> (the debugger's output filehandle) and C<STDOUT>
(the program's standard output). For C<||>, we only save C<OUT>. We open a
pipe to the pager (restoring the output filehandles if this fails). If this
is the C<|> command, we also set up a C<SIGPIPE> handler which will simply 
set C<$signal>, sending us back into the debugger.

We then trim off the pipe symbols and C<redo> the command loop at the
C<PIPE> label, causing us to evaluate the command in C<$cmd> without
reading another.

=head2 sub

C<sub> is called whenever a subroutine call happens in the program being 
debugged. The variable C<$DB::sub> contains the name of the subroutine
being called.

The core function of this subroutine is to actually call the sub in the proper
context, capturing its output. This of course causes C<DB::DB> to get called
again, repeating until the subroutine ends and returns control to C<DB::sub>
again. Once control returns, C<DB::sub> figures out whether or not to dump the
return value, and returns its captured copy of the return value as its own
return value. The value then feeds back into the program being debugged as if
C<DB::sub> hadn't been there at all.

C<sub> does all the work of printing the subroutine entry and exit messages
enabled by setting C<$frame>. It notes what sub the autoloader got called for,
and also prints the return value if needed (for the C<r> command and if 
the 16 bit is set in C<$frame>).

It also tracks the subroutine call depth by saving the current setting of
C<$single> in the C<@@stack> package global; if this exceeds the value in
C<$deep>, C<sub> automatically turns on printing of the current depth by
setting the 4 bit in C<$single>. In any case, it keeps the current setting
of stop/don't stop on entry to subs set as it currently is set.

=head1 EXTENDED COMMAND HANDLING AND THE COMMAND API

In Perl 5.8.0, there was a major realignment of the commands and what they did,
Most of the changes were to systematize the command structure and to eliminate
commands that threw away user input without checking.

The following sections describe the code added to make it easy to support 
multiple command sets with conflicting command names. This section is a start 
at unifying all command processing to make it simpler to develop commands.

Note that all the cmd_[a-zA-Z] subroutines require the command name, a line 
number, and C<$dbline> (the current line) as arguments.

Support functions in this section which have multiple modes of failure C<die> 
on error; the rest simply return a false value.

The user-interface functions (all of the C<cmd_*> functions) just output
error messages.

=head2 C<%set>

The C<%set> hash defines the mapping from command letter to subroutine
name suffix. 

C<%set> is a two-level hash, indexed by set name and then by command name.
Note that trying to set the CommandSet to 'foobar' simply results in the
5.8.0 command set being used, since there's no top-level entry for 'foobar'.

=head2 C<cmd_wrapper()> (API)

C<cmd_wrapper()> allows the debugger to switch command sets 
depending on the value of the C<CommandSet> option. 

It tries to look up the command in the X<C<%set>> package-level I<lexical>
(which means external entities can't fiddle with it) and create the name of 
the sub to call based on the value found in the hash (if it's there). I<All> 
of the commands to be handled in a set have to be added to C<%set>; if they 
aren't found, the 5.8.0 equivalent is called (if there is one).

This code uses symbolic references.

Set breakpoints. Since breakpoints can be set in so many places, in so many

=head3 C<$filename_error> (API package global)

Several of the functions we need to implement in the API need to work both
on the current file and on other files. We don't want to duplicate code, so
C<$filename_error> is used to contain the name of the file that's being 
worked on (if it's not the current one).

We can now build functions in pairs: the basic function works on the current
file, and uses C<$filename_error> as part of its error message. Since this is
initialized to C<''>, no filename will appear when we are working on the
current file.

The second function is a wrapper which does the following:

=over 4 

=item * Localizes C<$filename_error> and sets it to the name of the file to be processed.

=item * Localizes the C<*dbline> glob and reassigns it to point to the file we want to process. 

=item * Calls the first function. 

The first function works on the "current" (i.e., the one we changed to) file,
and prints C<$filename_error> in the error message (the name of the other file)
if it needs to. When the functions return, C<*dbline> is restored to point to the actual current file (the one we're executing in) and C<$filename_error> is 
restored to C<''>. This restores everything to the way it was before the 
second function was called at all.

See the comments in C<breakable_line> and C<breakable_line_in_file> for more
details.

=head3 breakable_line($from, $to) (API)

The subroutine decides whether or not a line in the current file is breakable.
It walks through C<@@dbline> within the range of lines specified, looking for
the first line that is breakable.

If C<$to> is greater than C<$from>, the search moves forwards, finding the 
first line I<after> C<$to> that's breakable, if there is one.

If C<$from> is greater than C<$to>, the search goes I<backwards>, finding the
first line I<before> C<$to> that's breakable, if there is one.

into a line spec. If it can't, it uses the current line. It then calls
C<delete_breakpoint> to actually do the work.

If C<*> is  specified, C<cmd_B> calls C<delete_breakpoint> with no arguments,
thereby deleting all the breakpoints.

=head3 delete_breakpoint([line]) (API)

This actually does the work of deleting either a single breakpoint, or all
of them.

For a single line, we look for it in C<@@dbline>. If it's nonbreakable, we
just drop out with a message saying so. If it is, we remove the condition
part of the 'condition\0action' that says there's a breakpoint here. If,
after we've done that, there's nothing left, we delete the corresponding
line in C<%dbline> to signal that no action needs to be taken for this line.

For all breakpoints, we iterate through the keys of C<%had_breakpoints>, 
which lists all currently-loaded files which have breakpoints. We then look
at each line in each of these files, temporarily switching the C<%dbline>
and C<@@dbline> structures to point to the files in question, and do what
we did in the single line case: delete the condition in C<@@dbline>, and
delete the key in C<%dbline> if nothing's left.

We then wholesale delete C<%postponed>, C<%postponed_file>, and 
C<%break_on_load>, because these structures contain breakpoints for files
and code that haven't been loaded yet. We can just kill these off because there
are no magical debugger structures associated with them.

=head3 C<cmd_l> - list lines (command)

Most of the command is taken up with transforming all the different line
specification syntaxes into 'start-stop'. After that is done, the command
runs a loop over C<@@dbline> for the specified range of lines. It handles 
the printing of each line and any markers (C<==E<gt>> for current line,
C<b> for break on this line, C<a> for action on this line, C<:> for this
line breakable). 

We save the last line listed in the C<$start> global for further listing
later.

=head3 C<cmd_L> - list breakpoints, actions, and watch expressions (command)

To list breakpoints, the command has to look determine where all of them are
first. It starts a C<%had_breakpoints>, which tells us what all files have
breakpoints and/or actions. For each file, we switch the C<*dbline> glob (the 
magic source and breakpoint data structures) to the file, and then look 
through C<%dbline> for lines with breakpoints and/or actions, listing them 
out. We look through C<%postponed> not-yet-compiled subroutines that have 
breakpoints, and through C<%postponed_file> for not-yet-C<require>'d files 
that have breakpoints.

Watchpoints are simpler: we just list the entries in C<@@to_watch>.

This command accepts either a watch expression to be removed from the list

If C<*> is specified, we simply empty the watch expression list and the 
watch expression value list. We also turn off the bit that says we've got 
watch expressions.

If an expression (or partial expression) is specified, we pattern-match
through the expressions and remove the ones that match. We also discard
the corresponding values. If no watch expressions are left, we turn off 
the 'watching expressions' bit.

=head2 C<postponed_sub>

Handles setting postponed breakpoints in subroutines once they're compiled.
For breakpoints, we use C<DB::find_sub> to locate the source file and line
range for the subroutine, then mark the file as having a breakpoint,
temporarily switch the C<*dbline> glob over to the source file, and then 
search the given range of lines to find a breakable line. If we find one,
we set the breakpoint on it, deleting the breakpoint from C<%postponed>.

=head2 C<postponed>

Called after each required file is compiled, but before it is executed;
also called if the name of a just-compiled subroutine is a key of 
C<%postponed>. Propagates saved breakpoints (from C<b compile>, C<b load>,
etc.) into the just-compiled code.

If this is a C<require>'d file, the incoming parameter is the glob 
C<*{"_<$filename"}>, with C<$filename> the name of the C<require>'d file.

=head2 C<dumpit>

C<dumpit> is the debugger's wrapper around dumpvar.pl. 

It gets a filehandle (to which C<dumpvar.pl>'s output will be directed) and
a reference to a variable (the thing to be dumped) as its input. 

The incoming filehandle is selected for output (C<dumpvar.pl> is printing to
the currently-selected filehandle, thank you very much). The current
values of the package globals C<$single> and C<$trace> are backed up in 
lexicals, and they are turned off (this keeps the debugger from trying
to single-step through C<dumpvar.pl> (I think.)). C<$frame> is localized to
preserve its current value and it is set to zero to prevent entry/exit
messages from printing, and C<$doret> is localized as well and set to -2 to 
prevent return values from being shown.

C<dumpit()> then checks to see if it needs to load C<dumpvar.pl> and 
tries to load it (note: if you have a C<dumpvar.pl>  ahead of the 
installed version in @@INC, yours will be used instead. Possible security 
problem?).

It then checks to see if the subroutine C<main::dumpValue> is now defined
(it should have been defined by C<dumpvar.pl>). If it has, C<dumpit()> 
localizes the globals necessary for things to be sane when C<main::dumpValue()>
is called, and picks up the variable to be dumped from the parameter list. 

It checks the package global C<%options> to see if there's a C<dumpDepth> 
specified. If not, -1 is assumed; if so, the supplied value gets passed on to 
C<dumpvar.pl>. This tells C<dumpvar.pl> where to leave off when dumping a 
structure: -1 means dump everything.

C<dumpValue()> is then called if possible; if not, C<dumpit()>just prints a 
warning.

In either case, C<$single>, C<$trace>, C<$frame>, and C<$doret> are restored
and we then return to the caller.

C<print_trace>'s job is to print a stack trace. It does this via the 
C<dump_trace> routine, which actually does all the ferreting-out of the
stack trace data. C<print_trace> takes care of formatting it nicely and
printing it to the proper filehandle.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * The filehandle to print to.

=item * How many frames to skip before starting trace.

=item * How many frames to print.

=item * A flag: if true, print a "short" trace without filenames, line numbers, or arguments

=head2 dump_trace(skip[,count])

Actually collect the traceback information available via C<caller()>. It does
some filtering and cleanup of the data, but mostly it just collects it to
make C<print_trace()>'s job easier.

C<skip> defines the number of stack frames to be skipped, working backwards
from the most current. C<count> determines the total number of frames to 
be returned; all of them (well, the first 10^9) are returned if C<count>
is omitted.

This routine returns a list of hashes, from most-recent to least-recent
stack frame. Each has the following keys and values:

=over 4

=item * C<context> - C<.> (null), C<$> (scalar), or C<@@> (array)

=item * C<sub> - subroutine name, or C<eval> information

=item * C<args> - undef, or a reference to an array of arguments

=item * C<file> - the file in which this item was defined (if any)

The C<system()> function assumes that it can just go ahead and use STDIN and
STDOUT, but under the debugger, we want it to use the debugger's input and 
outout filehandles. 

C<DB::system()> socks away the program's STDIN and STDOUT, and then substitutes
the debugger's IN and OUT filehandles for them. It does the C<system()> call,
and then puts everything back again.

Top-level function called when we want to set up a new terminal for use

If the C<noTTY> debugger option was set, we'll either use the terminal
supplied (the value of the C<noTTY> option), or we'll use C<Term::Rendezvous>
to find one. If we're a forked debugger, we call C<resetterm> to try to 
get a whole new terminal if we can. 

In either case, we set up the terminal next. If the C<ReadLine> option was
true, we'll get a C<Term::ReadLine> object for the current terminal and save
the appropriate attributes. We then

=head1 GET_FORK_TTY EXAMPLE FUNCTIONS

When the process being debugged forks, or the process invokes a command
via C<system()> which starts a new debugger, we need to be able to get a new
C<IN> and C<OUT> filehandle for the new debugger. Otherwise, the two processes
fight over the terminal, and you can never quite be sure who's going to get the
input you're typing.

C<get_fork_TTY> is a glob-aliased function which calls the real function that 
is tasked with doing all the necessary operating system mojo to get a new 
TTY (and probably another window) and to direct the new debugger to read and
write there.

The debugger provides C<get_fork_TTY> functions which work for X Windows and
OS/2. Other systems are not supported. You are encouraged to write 
C<get_fork_TTY> functions which work for I<your> platform and contribute them.

=head3 C<xterm_get_fork_TTY>

This function provides the C<get_fork_TTY> function for X windows. If a 
program running under the debugger forks, a new <xterm> window is opened and
the subsidiary debugger is directed there.

The C<open()> call is of particular note here. We have the new C<xterm>
we're spawning route file number 3 to STDOUT, and then execute the C<tty> 
command (which prints the device name of the TTY we'll want to use for input 
and output to STDOUT, then C<sleep> for a very long time, routing this output
to file number 3. This way we can simply read from the <XT> filehandle (which
is STDOUT from the I<commands> we ran) to get the TTY we want to use. 

Only works if C<xterm> is in your path and C<$ENV{DISPLAY}>, etc. are 
properly set up.

If the new debugger happened because of a C<system()> that invoked a

We take the current list of pids and add this one to the end. If there
isn't any list yet, we make one up out of the initial pid associated with 
the terminal and our new pid, sticking an arrow (either one-dashed or 
two dashed) in between them.

we don't try to create a new IN and OUT filehandle. Otherwise, we go ahead
and try to do that.

If there's nothing in the typeahead buffer, check the command filehandle stack.
If there are any filehandles there, read from the last one, and return the line
if we got one. If not, we pop the filehandle off and close it, and try the
next one up the stack.

If we've emptied the filehandle stack, we check to see if we've got a socket 
open, and we read that and return it if we do. If we don't, we just call the 
core C<readline()> and return its value.

=head1 OPTIONS SUPPORT ROUTINES

These routines handle listing and setting option values.

=head2 C<dump_option> - list the current value of an option setting

This routine uses C<option_val> to look up the value for an option.
It cleans up escaped single-quotes and then displays the option and
its value.

    my ($opt, $val) = @@_;
    $val = option_val($opt, 'N/A');
d2389 1
a2389 11
} ## end sub dump_option

=head2 C<option_val> - find the current value of an option

This can't just be a simple hash lookup because of the indirect way that
the option values are stored. Some are retrieved by calling a subroutine,
some are just variables.

You must supply a default value to be used in case the option isn't set.

    # If so, retrieve the value via the value in %optionVars.
    if (    defined $optionVars{$opt}
        and defined ${ $optionVars{$opt} }) {
        $val = ${ $optionVars{$opt} };
    }

    # Does this option exist, and it's a subroutine?
    # If so, call the subroutine via the ref in %optionAction
    # and capture the value.
    elsif ( defined $optionAction{$opt}
        and defined &{ $optionAction{$opt} }) {
        $val = &{ $optionAction{$opt} }();
    }

    # If there's an action or variable for the supplied option,
    # but no value was set, use the default.
    elsif (defined $optionAction{$opt} and not defined $option{$opt}
        or defined $optionVars{$opt} and not defined ${ $optionVars{$opt} })
    {
        $val = $default;
    }

    # Otherwise, do the simple hash lookup.
    else {
        $val = $option{$opt};
a2407 3

    # If the value isn't defined, use the default.
    # Then return whatever the value is.
d2409 2
a2410 23
    $val;
} ## end sub option_val

=head2 C<parse_options>

Handles the parsing and execution of option setting/displaying commands.

An option entered by itself is assumed to be 'set me to 1' (the default value)
if the option is a boolean one. If not, the user is prompted to enter a valid
value or to query the current value (via 'option? ').

If 'option=value' is entered, we try to extract a quoted string from the
value (if it is quoted). If it's not, we just use the whole value as-is.

We load any modules required to service this option, and then we set it: if
it just gets stuck in a variable, we do that; if there's a subroutine to 
handle setting the option, we call that.

Finally, if we're running in interactive mode, we display the effect of the
user's command back to the terminal, skipping this if we're setting things
during initialization.

=head1 RESTART SUPPORT

These routines are used to store (and restore) lists of items in environment 
variables during a restart.

=head2 set_list

Set_list packages up items to be stored in a set of environment variables
(VAR_n, containing the number of items, and VAR_0, VAR_1, etc., containing
the values). Values outside the standard ASCII charset are stored by encoding
then as hexadecimal values.

    # Grab each item in the list, escape the backslashes, encode the non-ASCII
    # as hex, and then save in the appropriate VAR_0, VAR_1, etc.
    for $i (0 .. $#list) {

    } ## end for $i (0 .. $#list)

Reverse the set_list operation: grab VAR_n to see how many we should be getting
back, and then pull VAR_0, VAR_1. etc. back out.

=head1 MISCELLANEOUS SIGNAL AND I/O MANAGEMENT

=head2 catch()

The C<catch()> subroutine is the essence of fast and low-impact. We simply
set an already-existing global scalar variable to a constant value. This 
avoids allocating any memory possibly in the middle of something that will
get all confused if we do.

=cut
d2517 1

a2519 12
=head2 C<warn()>

C<warn> emits a warning, by joining together its arguments and printing
them, with couple of fillips.

If the composited message I<doesn't> end with a newline, we automatically 
add C<$!> and a newline to the end of the message. The subroutine expects $OUT 
to be set to the filehandle to be used to output warnings; it makes no 
assumptions about what filehandles are available.

=head1 OPTION SUPPORT ROUTINES

The following routines are used to process some of the more complicated 
debugger options.

=head2 C<TTY>

Sets the input and output filehandles to the specified files or pipes.
If the terminal supports switching, we go ahead and do it. If not, and
there's already a terminal in place, we save the information to take effect
on restart.

If there's no terminal yet (for instance, during debugger initialization),
we go ahead and set C<$console> and C<$tty> to the file indicated.

=cut
d2545 11
a2555 27
        # This terminal supports switching to a new TTY.
        # Can be a list of two files, or on string containing both names,

        my ($in, $out) = shift; 
        if ($in =~ /,/) {
            # Split list apart if supplied.
            ($in, $out) = split /,/, $in, 2;
        }
        else {
            # Use the same file for both input and output.
            $out = $in;
        }

        # Open file onto the debugger's filehandles, if you can.
        open IN, $in or die "cannot open `$in' for read: $!";
        open OUT, ">$out" or die "cannot open `$out' for write: $!";

        # Swap to the new filehandles.
        reset_IN_OUT(\*IN, \*OUT);

    # Return whatever the TTY is.
d2560 1
a2560 9
} ## end sub TTY

=head2 C<noTTY>

Sets the C<$notty> global, controlling whether or not the debugger tries to
get a terminal to read from. If called after a terminal is already in place,
we save the value to use it if we're restarted.

=head2 C<ReadLine>

Sets the C<$rl> option variable. If 0, we use C<Term::ReadLine::Stub> 
(essentially, no C<readline> processing on this "terminal"). Otherwise, we
use C<Term::ReadLine>. Can't be changed after a terminal's in place; we save
the value in case a restart is done so we can change it then.

=head2 C<RemotePort>

Sets the port that the debugger will try to connect to when starting up.
If the terminal's already been set up, we can't do it, but we remember the
setting in case the user does a restart.

=cut
d2584 1
a2584 8

=head2 C<tkRunning>

Checks with the terminal to see if C<Tk> is running, and returns true or

=head2 C<NonStop>

Sets nonstop mode. If a terminal's already been set up, it's too late; the
debugger remembers the setting in case you restart, though.

was passed as the argument. (This means you can't override the terminal's
ornaments.)

Called with no arguments, returns the file or pipe that line info should go to.

file or pipe again to the caller.

=head1 COMMAND SUPPORT ROUTINES

These subroutines provide functionality for various commands.

=head2 C<list_modules>

For the C<M> command: list modules loaded and their versions.
Essentially just runs through the keys in %INC, picks up the 
$VERSION package globals from each package, gets the file name, and formats the
information for output.

=cut

sub list_modules {    # versions

    # Hey, dumpit() formats a hash nicely, so why not use it?
    dumpit($OUT, \%version);
} ## end sub list_modules

=head2 C<sethelp()>

Sets up the monster string used to format and print the help.

=head3 HELP MESSAGE FORMAT

The help message is a peculiar format unto itself; it mixes C<pod> 'ornaments'
(BE<lt>E<gt>, IE<gt>E<lt>) with tabs to come up with a format that's fairly
easy to parse and portable, but which still allows the help to be a little
nicer than just plain text.

Essentially, you define the command name (usually marked up with BE<gt>E<lt>
and IE<gt>E<lt>), followed by a tab, and then the descriptive text, ending in a newline. The descriptive text can also be marked up in the same way. If you 
need to continue the descriptive text to another line, start that line with 
just tabs and then enter the marked-up text.

If you are modifying the help text, I<be careful>. The help-string parser is 
not very sophisticated, and if you don't follow these rules it will mangle the 
help beyond hope until you fix the string.

} ## end sub dbwarn

=head2 C<dbdie>

The debugger's own C<$SIG{__DIE__}> handler. Handles providing a stack trace
by loading C<Carp> and calling C<Carp::longmess()> to get it. We turn off 
single stepping and tracing during the call to C<Carp::longmess> to avoid 
debugging it - we just want to use it.

If C<dieLevel> is zero, we let the program being debugged handle the
exceptions. If it's 1, you get backtraces for any exception. If it's 2,
the debugger takes over all exception handling, printing a backtrace and
displaying the exception via its C<dbwarn()> routine.

=head2 C<warnlevel()>

Set the C<$DB::warnLevel> variable that stores the value of the
C<warnLevel> option. Calling C<warnLevel()> with a positive value
results in the debugger taking over all warning handlers. Setting
C<warnLevel> to zero leaves any warning handlers set up by the program
being debugged in place.

=head1 SUBROUTINE DECODING SUPPORT

These subroutines are used during the C<x> and C<X> commands to try to
produce as much information as possible about a code reference. They use
L<Devel::Peek> to try to find the glob in which this code reference lives
(if it does) - this allows us to actually code references which correspond
to named subroutines (including those aliased via glob assignment).

=head2 C<CvGV_name()>

Wrapper for X<CvGV_name_or_bust>; tries to get the name of a reference
via that routine. If this fails, return the reference again (when the
reference is stringified, it'll come out as "SOMETHING(0X...)").

=head2 C<CvGV_name_or_bust> I<coderef>

Calls L<Devel::Peek> to try to find the glob the ref lives in; returns
C<undef> if L<Devel::Peek> can't be loaded, or if C<Devel::Peek::CvGV> can't
find a glob for this ref.

Returns "I<package>::I<glob name>" if the code ref is found in a glob.

=head2 C<find_sub>

A utility routine used in various places; finds the file where a subroutine 
was defined, and returns that filename and a line-number range.

Tries to use X<@@sub> first; if it can't find it there, it tries building a
reference to the subroutine and uses X<CvGV_name_or_bust> to locate it,
loading it into X<@@sub> as a side effect (XXX I think). If it can't find it
this way, it brute-force searches X<%sub>, checking for identical references.

debugger package globals that C<DB::sub()> requires have to be defined before
any subroutines can be called. These are defined in the second C<BEGIN> block.

This block sets things up so that (basically) the world is sane
before the debugger starts executing. We set up various variables that the
debugger has to have set up before the Perl core starts running:

=over 4 

=item * The debugger's own filehandles (copies of STD and STDOUT for now).

=item * Characters for shell escapes, the recall command, and the history command.

=item * The maximum recursion depth.

=item * The size of a C<w> command's window.

=item * The before-this-line context to be printed in a C<v> (view a window around this line) command.

=item * The fact that we're not in a sub at all right now.

=item * The default SIGINT handler for the debugger.

=item * The appropriate value of the flag in C<$^D> that says the debugger is running

=item * The current debugger recursion level

=item * The list of postponed (XXX define) items and the C<$single> stack

=item * That we want no return values and no subroutine entry/exit trace.

=head1 READLINE SUPPORT - COMPLETION FUNCTION

=head2 db_complete

C<readline> support - adds command completion to basic C<readline>. 

Returns a list of possible completions to C<readline> when invoked. C<readline>
will print the longest common substring following the text already entered. 

If there is only a single possible completion, C<readline> will use it in full.

This code uses C<map> and C<grep> heavily to create lists of possible 
completion. Think LISP in this section.

    my ($text, $line, $start) = @@_;

    # Save the initial text.
    # The search pattern is current package, ::, extract the next qualifier
    # Prefix and pack are set to undef.

=head3 C<b postpone|compile> 

=over 4

=item * Find all the subroutines that might match in this package

=item * Add "postpone", "load", and "compile" as possibles (we may be completing the keyword itself

=item * Include all the rest of the subs that are known

=item * C<grep> out the ones that match the text we have so far

=item * Return this as the list of possible completions

=back

=cut 

    return sort grep /^\Q$text/, (keys %sub),
      qw(postpone load compile),    # subroutines
      (map { /$search/ ? ($1) : () } keys %sub)
      if (substr $line, 0, $start) =~ /^\|*[blc]\s+((postpone|compile)\s+)?$/;

=head3 C<b load>

Get all the possible files from @@INC as it currently stands and
select the ones that match the text so far.

=cut

    return sort grep /^\Q$text/, values %INC    # files
      if (substr $line, 0, $start) =~ /^\|*b\s+load\s+$/;

=head3  C<V> (list variable) and C<m> (list modules)

There are two entry points for these commands:

=head4 Unqualified package names

Get the top-level packages and grab everything that matches the text
so far. For each match, recursively complete the partial packages to
get all possible matching packages. Return this sorted list.

=cut

    return sort map { ($_, db_complete($_ . "::", "V ", 2)) }
      grep /^\Q$text/, map { /^(.*)::$/ ? ($1) : () } keys %::  # top-packages
d3381 65
a3445 251

=head4 Qualified package names

Take a partially-qualified package and find all subpackages for it
by getting all the subpackages for the package so far, matching all
the subpackages against the text, and discarding all of them which 
start with 'main::'. Return this list.

=cut

    return sort map { ($_, db_complete($_ . "::", "V ", 2)) }
      grep !/^main::/, grep /^\Q$text/,
        map { /^(.*)::$/ ? ($prefix . "::$1") : () } keys %{ $prefix . '::' }
          if (substr $line, 0, $start) =~ /^\|*[Vm]\s+$/
              and $text =~ /^(.*[^:])::?(\w*)$/
              and $prefix = $1;

=head3 C<f> - switch files

Here, we want to get a fully-qualified filename for the C<f> command.
Possibilities are:

=over 4

=item 1. The original source file itself

=item 2. A file from C<@@INC>

=item 3. An C<eval> (the debugger gets a C<(eval N)> fake file for each C<eval>).

=back

=cut

    if ($line =~ /^\|*f\s+(.*)/) {                              # Loaded files
        # We might possibly want to switch to an eval (which has a "filename"
        # like '(eval 9)'), so we may need to clean up the completion text 
        # before proceeding. 
        $prefix = length($1) - length($text);
        $text   = $1;

=pod

Under the debugger, source files are represented as C<_E<lt>/fullpath/to/file> 
(C<eval>s are C<_E<lt>(eval NNN)>) keys in C<%main::>. We pull all of these 
out of C<%main::>, add the initial source file, and extract the ones that 
match the completion text so far.

=cut

        return sort
          map { substr $_, 2 + $prefix } grep /^_<\Q$text/, (keys %main::),
          $0;
    } ## end if ($line =~ /^\|*f\s+(.*)/)

=head3 Subroutine name completion

We look through all of the defined subs (the keys of C<%sub>) and
return both all the possible matches to the subroutine name plus
all the matches qualified to the current package.

=cut

    if ((substr $text, 0, 1) eq '&') {    # subroutines
        $text = substr $text, 1;
        $prefix = "&";

            map { /$search/ ? ($1) : () }
              keys %sub
              );
    } ## end if ((substr $text, 0, ...

=head3  Scalar, array, and hash completion: partially qualified package

Much like the above, except we have to do a little more cleanup:

=cut

    if ($text =~ /^[\$@@%](.*)::(.*)/) {    # symbols in a package

=pod

=over 4 

=item * Determine the package that the symbol is in. Put it in C<::> (effectively C<main::>) if no package is specified.

=cut

        $pack = ($1 eq 'main' ? '' : $1) . '::';

=pod

=item * Figure out the prefix vs. what needs completing.

=cut

        $prefix = (substr $text, 0, 1) . $1 . '::';
        $text = $2;

=pod

=item * Look through all the symbols in the package. C<grep> out all the possible hashes/arrays/scalars, and then C<grep> the possible matches out of those. C<map> the prefix onto all the possibilities.

=cut

        my @@out = map "$prefix$_", grep /^\Q$text/, grep /^_?[a-zA-Z]/,
          keys %$pack;

=item * If there's only one hit, and it's a package qualifier, and it's not equal to the initial text, re-complete it using the symbol we actually found.

=cut

        if (@@out == 1 and $out[0] =~ /::$/ and $out[0] ne $itext) {
            return db_complete($out[0], $line, $start);
        }

        # Return the list of possibles.
        return sort @@out;

    } ## end if ($text =~ /^[\$@@%](.*)::(.*)/)

=head3 Symbol completion: current package or package C<main>.

=cut


    if ($text =~ /^[\$@@%]/) {    # symbols (in $package + packages in main)

=cut

        $pack = ($package eq 'main' ? '' : $package) . '::';

=pod

=item * We set the prefix to the item's sigil, and trim off the sigil to get the text to be completed.

=cut

        $prefix = substr $text, 0, 1;
        $text = substr $text, 1;

=pod

=item * If the package is C<::> (C<main>), create an empty list; if it's something else, create a list of all the packages known.  Append whichever list to a list of all the possible symbols in the current package. C<grep> out the matches to the text entered so far, then C<map> the prefix back onto the symbols.

=cut

        my @@out = map "$prefix$_", grep /^\Q$text/,
          (grep /^_?[a-zA-Z]/, keys %$pack),

        # Return the list of possibles.
        return sort @@out;
    } ## end if ($text =~ /^[\$@@%]/)

=head3 Options 

We use C<option_val()> to look up the current value of the option. If there's
only a single value, we complete the command in such a way that it is a 
complete command for setting the option in question. If there are multiple
possible values, we generate a command consisting of the option plus a trailing
question mark, which, if executed, will list the current value of the option.

=cut

    if ((substr $line, 0, $start) =~ /^\|*$cmd\b.*\s$/) { # Options after space

        # and fetch the current value. 
        my @@out = grep /^\Q$text/, @@options;

For entering filenames. We simply call C<readline>'s C<filename_list()>
method with the completion text to get the possible completions.

=head1 END PROCESSING - THE C<END> BLOCK

Come here at the very end of processing. We want to go into a 
loop where we allow the user to enter commands and interact with the 
debugger, but we don't want anything else to execute. 

First we set the C<$finished> variable, so that some commands that
shouldn't be run after the end of program quit working.

We then figure out whether we're truly done (as in the user entered a C<q>
command, or we finished execution while running nonstop). If we aren't,
we set C<$single> to 1 (causing the debugger to get control again).

We then call C<DB::fake::at_exit()>, which returns the C<Use 'q' to quit ...">
message and returns control to the debugger. Repeat.

When the user finally enters a C<q> command, C<$fall_off_end> is set to
1 and the C<END> block simply exits with C<$single> set to 0 (don't 
break, run to completion.).

Some of the commands changed function quite a bit in the 5.8 command 
realignment, so much so that the old code had to be replaced completely.
Because we wanted to retain the option of being able to go back to the
former command set, we moved the old code off to this section.

There's an awful lot of duplicated code here. We've duplicated the

=head1 PRE-AND-POST-PROMPT COMMANDS AND ACTIONS

The debugger used to have a bunch of nearly-identical code to handle 
the pre-and-post-prompt action commands. C<cmd_pre590_prepost> and
C<cmd_prepost> unify all this into one set of code to handle the 
appropriate actions.

=head2 C<cmd_pre590_prepost>

A small wrapper around C<cmd_prepost>; it makes sure that the default doesn't
do something destructive. In pre 5.8 debuggers, the default action was to
delete all the actions.

=cut

} ## end sub cmd_pre590_prepost

=head2 C<cmd_prepost>

Actually does all the handling foe C<E<lt>>, C<E<gt>>, C<{{>, C<{>, etc.
Since the lists of actions are all held in arrays that are pointed to by
references anyway, all we have to do is pick the right array reference and
then use generic code to all, delete, or list actions.

=cut

Rerun the current session to:

    rerun        current position

    rerun 4      command number 4

    rerun -4     current command minus 4 (go back 4 steps)

Whether this always makes sense, in the current context is unknowable, and is
in part left as a useful exersize for the reader.  This sub returns the
appropriate arguments to rerun the current session.

=item restart

Restarting the debugger is a complex operation that occurs in several phases.
First, we try to reconstruct the command line that was used to invoke Perl
and the debugger.

=cut

sub restart {
    # I may not be able to resurrect you, but here goes ...
    print $OUT
"Warning: some settings and command-line options may be lost!\n";
    my ( @@script, @@flags, $cl );

    # If warn was on before, turn it on again.
    push @@flags, '-w' if $ini_warn;
    if ( $ini_assertion and @@{^ASSERTING} ) {
        push @@flags,
          ( map { /\:\^\(\?\:(.*)\)\$\)/ ? "-A$1" : "-A$_" }
              @@{^ASSERTING} );
    }

    # Rebuild the -I flags that were on the initial
    # command line.
    for (@@ini_INC) {
        push @@flags, '-I', $_;
    }

    # Turn on taint if it was on before.
    push @@flags, '-T' if ${^TAINT};

    # Arrange for setting the old INC:
    # Save the current @@init_INC in the environment.
    set_list( "PERLDB_INC", @@ini_INC );

    # If this was a perl one-liner, go to the "file"
    # corresponding to the one-liner read all the lines
    # out of it (except for the first one, which is going
    # to be added back on again when 'perl -d' runs: that's
    # the 'require perl5db.pl;' line), and add them back on
    # to the command line to be executed.
    if ( $0 eq '-e' ) {
        for ( 1 .. $#{'::_<-e'} ) {  # The first line is PERL5DB
            chomp( $cl = ${'::_<-e'}[$_] );
            push @@script, '-e', $cl;
        }
    } ## end if ($0 eq '-e')

    # Otherwise we just reuse the original name we had
    # before.
    else {
        @@script = $0;
    }

=pod

After the command line  has been reconstructed, the next step is to save
the debugger's status in environment variables. The C<DB::set_list> routine
is used to save aggregate variables (both hashes and arrays); scalars are
just popped into environment variables directly.

=cut

    # If the terminal supported history, grab it and
    # save that in the environment.
    set_list( "PERLDB_HIST",
          $term->Features->{getHistory}
        ? $term->GetHistory
        : @@hist );

    # Find all the files that were visited during this
    # session (i.e., the debugger had magic hashes
    # corresponding to them) and stick them in the environment.
    my @@had_breakpoints = keys %had_breakpoints;
    set_list( "PERLDB_VISITED", @@had_breakpoints );

    # Save the debugger options we chose.
    set_list( "PERLDB_OPT", %option );
    # set_list( "PERLDB_OPT", options2remember() );

    # Save the break-on-loads.
    set_list( "PERLDB_ON_LOAD", %break_on_load );

=pod 

The most complex part of this is the saving of all of the breakpoints. They
can live in an awful lot of places, and we have to go through all of them,
find the breakpoints, and then save them in the appropriate environment
variable via C<DB::set_list>.

=cut

    # Go through all the breakpoints and make sure they're
    # still valid.
    my @@hard;
    for ( 0 .. $#had_breakpoints ) {

        # We were in this file.
        my $file = $had_breakpoints[$_];

        # Grab that file's magic line hash.
        *dbline = $main::{ '_<' . $file };

        # Skip out if it doesn't exist, or if the breakpoint
        # is in a postponed file (we'll do postponed ones
        # later).
        next unless %dbline or $postponed_file{$file};

        # In an eval. This is a little harder, so we'll
        # do more processing on that below.
        ( push @@hard, $file ), next
          if $file =~ /^\(\w*eval/;

        # XXX I have no idea what this is doing. Yet.
        my @@add;
        @@add = %{ $postponed_file{$file} }
          if $postponed_file{$file};

        # Save the list of all the breakpoints for this file.
        set_list( "PERLDB_FILE_$_", %dbline, @@add );
    } ## end for (0 .. $#had_breakpoints)

    # The breakpoint was inside an eval. This is a little
    # more difficult. XXX and I don't understand it.
    for (@@hard) {
        # Get over to the eval in question.
        *dbline = $main::{ '_<' . $_ };
        my ( $quoted, $sub, %subs, $line ) = quotemeta $_;
        for $sub ( keys %sub ) {

After all the debugger status has been saved, we take the command we built up
and then return it, so we can C<exec()> it. The debugger will spot the
C<PERLDB_RESTART> environment variable and realize it needs to reload its state
from the environment.

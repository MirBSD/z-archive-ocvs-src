### Thanks for your reply. After looking at the examples, I realized that
### you're not doing what I want, which is to store the messages on the local
### hard disk with the same message number as what was on the remote. So, I
### rolled my own program, although I haven't finished it yet (I have a hook
### for expiring, but haven't done it yet).
### 
### You are welcome to use this in the Net:: distribution if you think it is
### useful.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

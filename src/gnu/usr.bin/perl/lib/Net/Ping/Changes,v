@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

	  in order to avoid catching SIGALRM trigger and
	  to avoid conflicts with other evals.
	- 3) Avoid ioctl() syscall for more accurate error
	  detection on non-blocking tcp connects.
	- 4) Fix fcntl() syntax usage.

2.24  Oct 21 22:00 2002

	  (solaris and freebsd) and to be SMP safer.
	- Win32 $p->ack( $host ) method should now work.
	- Add ack( $host ) test cases to test suite.

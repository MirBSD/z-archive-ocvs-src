=head1 NAME

abbrev - create an abbreviation table from a list

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Abbrev;
    abbrev $hashref, LIST


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stores all unambiguous truncations of each element of LIST
as keys in the associative array referenced by C<$hashref>.
The values are the original list elements.

=head1 EXAMPLE

    $hashref = abbrev qw(list edit send abort gripe);

    %hash = abbrev qw(list edit send abort gripe);

    abbrev $hashref, qw(list edit send abort gripe);

    abbrev(*hash, qw(list edit send abort gripe));

=cut

@@ISA = qw(Exporter);
@@EXPORT = qw(abbrev);

# Usage:
#	abbrev \%foo, LIST;
#	...
#	$long = $foo{$short};

sub abbrev {
    my ($word, $hashref, $glob, %table, $returnvoid);

    if (ref($_[0])) {           # hash reference preferably
      $hashref = shift;
      $returnvoid = 1;
    } elsif (ref \$_[0] eq 'GLOB') {  # is actually a glob (deprecated)
      $hashref = \%{shift()};
      $returnvoid = 1;
    }
    %{$hashref} = ();

    WORD: foreach $word (@@_) {
        for (my $len = (length $word) - 1; $len > 0; --$len) {
	    my $abbrev = substr($word,0,$len);
	    my $seen = ++$table{$abbrev};
	    if ($seen == 1) {	    # We're the first word so far to have
	    			    # this abbreviation.
	        $hashref->{$abbrev} = $word;
	    } elsif ($seen == 2) {  # We're the second word to have this
	    			    # abbreviation, so we can't use it.
	        delete $hashref->{$abbrev};
	    } else {		    # We're the third word to have this
	    			    # abbreviation, so skip to the next word.
	        next WORD;
	    }
	}
    }
    # Non-abbreviations always get entered, even if they aren't unique

        $hashref->{$word} = $word;
    }

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

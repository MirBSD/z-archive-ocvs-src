=head1 NAME

PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint - PerlIO layer for quoted-printable strings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint;

 open( my $in,'<:via(QuotedPrint)','file.qp' )
  or die "Can't open file.qp for reading: $!\n";
 
 open( my $out,'>:via(QuotedPrint)','file.qp' )
  or die "Can't open file.qp for writing: $!\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a PerlIO layer that works on files encoded in the
quoted-printable format.  It will decode from quoted-printable while reading
from a handle, and it will encode as quoted-printable while writing to a handle.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<PerlIO::via::MD5>, L<PerlIO::via::StripHTML>, L<PerlIO::via::Rotate>.

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

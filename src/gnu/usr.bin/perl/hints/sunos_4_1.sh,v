# Configure will issue a WHOA warning.  The problem is that

# available in the System V environment.

# Configure will issue a WHOA warning.  The problem is that unistd.h
# contains incorrect prototypes for some functions in the usual
# BSD-ish environment.  In particular, it has
# extern int	getgroups(/* int gidsetsize, gid_t grouplist[] */);
# but groupslist[] ought to be of type int, not gid_t.
# This is only really a problem for perl if the
# user is using gcc, and not running in the SysV environment.
# The gcc fix-includes script exposes those incorrect prototypes.
# There may be other examples as well.  Volunteers are welcome to
# track them all down :-).  In the meantime, we'll just skip unistd.h
# for SunOS in most of the code.   
# However, see ext/POSIX/hints/sunos_4.pl for one exception.
i_unistd='undef'
# See util.c for another:  We need _SC_OPEN_MAX, which is in
# <unistd.h>.

# fflush(NULL) will core dump on SunOS 4.1.3.  In util.c we'll
# try explicitly fflushing all open files.  Unfortunately,
# on my SunOS 4.1.3 system, sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) returns
# 64, but only 32 of those file pointers can be accessed 
# directly by _iob[i].  The remainder are off in dynamically
# allocated memory somewhere and I don't know to automatically
# fflush() them.  -- Andy Dougherty  Wed May 26 15:25:22 EDT 1999

You will probably see  *** WHOA THERE!!! ***  messages from Configure for
d_tzname and i_unistd.  Keep the recommended values.  See
hints/sunos_4_1.sh for more information.

# The correct setting of groupstype depends on which version of the C
# library is used.  If you are in the 'System V environment'
# (i.e. you have /usr/5bin ahead of /usr/bin in your PATH), and
# you use Sun's cc compiler, then you'll pick up /usr/5bin/cc, which
# links against the C library in /usr/5lib.  This library has
# groupstype='gid_t'.
# If you are in the normal BSDish environment, then you'll pick up
# /usr/ucb/cc, which links against the C library in /usr/lib.  That
# library has groupstype='int'.
#
# If you are using gcc, it links against the C library in /usr/lib
# independent of whether or not you are in the 'System V environment'.
# If you want to use the System V libraries, then you need to 
# manually set groupstype='gid_t' and add explicit references to 
# /usr/5lib when Configure prompts you for where to look for libraries.
#
# Check if user is in a bsd or system 5 type environment
if cat -b /dev/null 2>/dev/null

# If you get the message "unresolved symbol '__lib_version' " while
# linking, your system probably has the optional 'acc' compiler (and
# libraries) installed, but you are using the bundled 'cc' compiler with
# the unbundled libraries.  The solution is either to use 'acc' and the
# unbundled libraries (specifically /lib/libm.a), or 'cc' and the bundled
# library.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

# From: Matthew Black <black@@csulb.edu>
# Subject: sockets broken under IRIX 5.3? YES...how to fix
# Anyone attempting to use perl4 or perl5 with SGI IRIX 5.3 may discover
# that sockets are essentially broken.  The syslog interface for perl also
# fails because it uses the broken socket interface.  This problem was
# reported to SGI as bug #255347 and it can be fixed by installing 
# patchSG0000596.  The patch can be downloaded from Advantage OnLine (SGI's
# WWW server) or from the Support Advantage 9/95 Patch CDROM.  Thanks to Tom 
# Christiansen and others who provided assistance.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

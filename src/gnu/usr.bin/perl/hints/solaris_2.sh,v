# Lupe Christoph <lupe@@lupe-christoph.de>
# Based on version by:
# Andy Dougherty  <doughera@@lafayette.edu>
# Which was based on input from lots of folks, especially
# Dean Roehrich <roehrich@@ironwood-fddi.cray.com>

# See README.solaris for additional information.
#
# For consistency with gcc, we do not adopt Sun Marketing's
# removal of the '2.' prefix from the Solaris version number.
# (Configure tries to detect an old fixincludes and needs
# this information.)

# If perl fails tests that involve dynamic loading of extensions, and
# you are using gcc, be sure that you are NOT using GNU as and ld.  One
# way to do that is to invoke Configure with
#
#     sh Configure -Dcc='gcc -B/usr/ccs/bin/'
#
#  (Note that the trailing slash is *required*.)
#  gcc will occasionally emit warnings about "unused prefix", but
#  these ought to be harmless.  See below for more details.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

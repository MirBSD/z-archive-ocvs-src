# Internally at Concurrent, we use a source management tool which winds up

# That upsets the perl build process when it tries to edit opcode.h and

# when Configure runs. (If you already have "real" source files, this won't
# do anything).

# Need to use Concurrent cc for most of these options to be meaningful (if
# you want to get this to work with gcc, you're on your own :-). Passing
# -Bexport to the linker when linking perl is important because it leaves
# the interpreter internal symbols visible to the shared libs that will be
# loaded on demand (and will try to reference those symbols). The -u option
# to drag 'sigaction' into the perl main program is to make sure it gets
# defined for the posix shared library (for some reason sigaction is static,
# rather than being defined in libc.so.1). The 88110compat option makes sure
# the code will run on both 88100 and 88110 machines. The define is added to
# trigger a work around for a compiler bug which shows up in pp.c.

# Configure sometimes finds what it believes to be ndbm header files on the
# system and imagines that we have the NDBM library, but we really don't.
# There is something there that once resembled ndbm, but it is purely
# for internal use in some tool and has been hacked beyond recognition

WARNING: If you are using ksh to run the Configure script, you may find it
failing in mysterious ways (such as failing to find library routines which
are known to exist). Configure seems to push ksh beyond its limits
sometimes. Try using env to strip unnecessary things out of the environment
and run Configure with /sbin/sh. That sometimes seems to produce more
accurate results.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

# MachTen does not support dynamic loading. If you wish to, you
# can fetch, compile, and install the dld package.
# This ought to work with the ext/DynaLoader/dl_dld.xs in the 
# perl5 package. Have fun!
# Some possible locations for dld:
# ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu:pub/scm/dld-3.2.7.tar.gz
# prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/jacal/dld-3.2.7.tar.gz
# ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/imp/SCM-support/dld-3.2.7.tar.gz
# tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/libs/dld-3.2.7.tar.gz
#
#  Original version was for MachTen 2.1.1.

# MachTen's ability to have valid filepaths beginning with "//" may
# be causing lib/FindBin.pm to fail. I don't know how to fix it, but
# the reader is encouraged to do so! :-)  -- Tom

# There seem to be some hard-to-diagnose problems under MachTen's
# malloc, so we'll use Perl's. If you have problems which Perl's
# malloc's diagnostics can't help you with, you may wish to use
# MachTen's malloc after all.
case "$usemymalloc" in
'') usemymalloc='y' ;;
esac

# I (Tom Phoenix) don't know how to test for locales on MachTen. (If
# you do, please fix this hints file!) But since mine didn't come
# with locales working out of the box, I'll assume that's the case
# for most folks.
case "$d_setlocale" in
'') d_setlocale=undef
esac

# MachTen doesn't have secure setid scripts
d_suidsafe='undef'

# groupstype should be gid_t, as near as I can tell, but it only
# seems to work right when it's int. 
groupstype='int'

case "$optimize" in
'') optimize='-O2' ;;
esac

so='none'
# These are useful only if you have DLD, but harmless otherwise.
# Make sure gcc doesn't use -fpic.
cccdlflags=' '  # That's an empty space.
lddlflags='-r'
dlext='o'

# MachTen does not support POSIX enough to compile the POSIX module.
useposix=false

#MachTen might have an incomplete Berkeley DB implementation.
i_db=$undef

#MachTen versions 2.X have no hard links.  This variable is used
# by File::Find.
# This will generate a harmless message:
# Hmm...You had some extra variables I don't know about...I'll try to keep 'em.
#	Propagating recommended variable dont_use_nlink
# Without this, tests io/fs #4 and op/stat #3 will fail.
dont_use_nlink=define

cat <<'EOM' >&4

During Configure, you may get two "WHOA THERE" messages, for $d_setlocale
and $i_db being 'undef'. You may keep the undef value.

At the end of Configure, you will see a harmless message

Hmm...You had some extra variables I don't know about...I'll try to keep 'em.
	Propagating recommended variable dont_use_nlink

Read the File::Find documentation for more information.

It's possible that test t/lib/findbin.t will fail on some configurations
of MachTen.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

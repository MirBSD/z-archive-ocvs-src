@# Sequent Dynix/Ptx v. 4 hints
# Created 1996/03/15 by Brad Howerter, bhower@@wgc.woodward.com

# Modified 1998/11/10 by Martin J. Bligh, mbligh@@sequent.com
# to incorporate work done by Kurtis D. Rader & myself.

# Use Configure -Dcc=gcc to use gcc.

# cc wants -G for dynamic loading
lddlflags='-G'

# Remove inet to avoid this error in Configure, which causes Configure
# to be unable to figure out return types:
# dynamic linker: ./ssize: can't find libinet.so,
# link with -lsocket instead of -linet

libswanted=`echo $libswanted | sed -e 's/ inet / /'`

# Configure defaults to usenm='y', which doesn't work very well
usenm='n'

# removed d_vfork='define'; we can't use it any more ...

case "$optimize" in
'') optimize='-Wc,-O3 -W0,-xstring' ;;
esac

# We override d_socket because it's very hard for Configure to get it right
# in Dynix/Ptx, for several reasons.
# (1) the socket interface is in libsocket.so -- this wouldn't be so hard
#     for Configure to fathom...but it gets more tangled.
# (2) if the system has been patched there can be libsocket.so.1.FOO.BAR,
#     the FOO.BAR being the old version of the system before the patching.
#     Configure picks up the old broken version.
# (3) libsocket.so points to either libsocket.so.1 (v4.2)
#     or libsocket.so.1.1 (v4.4)  The socket call in libsocket.so.1.1
#     (BSD socket library) is called bsd_socket(), and has a macro wrapper
#     to hide this.
# This information kindly provided by Martin J. Bligh of Sequent.
# As he puts it:
# "Sequent has unusual capabilities, taking it above and beyond
#  the complexity of any other vendor" :-)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

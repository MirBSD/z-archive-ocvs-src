@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

 * misc. changes in /etc, mostly user related
 * Perl 5.8.2 (diff to MirPorts will be committed RSN)
 * some changes to binutils
 * Updates in bc and dc

# __UWIN__ added so it could be used in ext/POSIX/POSIX.xs
# to protect against either tzname definition.  According to Dave Korn

#dgk gcc on uwin also predefined _UWIN as does the borland and digital
#dgk mars compiler.
#dgk 
#dgk Only ncc does not define _UWIN and this is intentional.  ncc is used
#dgk to build binaries that do not require the uwin runtime.
#dgk This could be used for building a native win32 perl using unix
#dgk makefiles.  However, in this case you don't wan't _UWIN defined.
#dgk 
#dgk I have used _UWIN everywhere else in any uwin specific changes.
#dgk and _WIN32 on windows specific changes, and _MSVC on any compiler
#dgk Visual C specific changes.  We also define _WINIX for any unix
#dgk on windows implementation so that _UWIN or __cygwin__ imply _WINIX.

# I left __UWIN__ as is, since I had already filed a patch,
# and it might be useful to distinguish perl-specific tweaks
# from generic uwin ones.

ccflags="$ccflags -D__UWIN__"

# This from Dave Korn
#dgk Windows splits shared libraries into two parts; the part used
#dgk for linking and the part that is used for running.
#dgk Given a library foo, then the part you link with is named
#dgk	foo.lib
#dgk and is in the lib directory.  The part that you run with
#dgk is named
#dgk	foo.dll or foo#.dll
#dgk and is in the bin directory.  This way when you set you PATH
#dgk variable, it automatically does the library search.
#dgk
#dgk Static libraries use libfoo.a.
#dgk By the way if you specify -lfoo, then it will first look for foo.lib
#dgk and then libfoo.a.  If you specify +lfoo, it will only look for
#dgk static versions of the library.

# So we use .lib as the extension, and put -lm in, because it is a .a
# This probably accounts for the comment about dynamic libraries
# needing work, and indeed, the build failed if I didn't undef it.

lib_ext=".lib"
libs="-lm"

# dynamic loading still needs work

# lest it default to .exe, and then there's no perl in the test directory,
# t, just a perl.exe, and make test promptly dies.  _exe gets set to .exe
# by Configure (on 5/23/2003) if exe_ext is merely null, so clean it out, too.

# Some other comments:
# If you see something like

#          got: '/E/users/jpl/src/cmd/perl/t'
#     expected: '/e/users/jpl/src/cmd/perl/t'
#     Failed test (../ext/Cwd/t/cwd.t at line 88)

# when running tests under harness, try the simple expedient of
# changing to directory
#     /E/users/jpl/src/cmd/perl/t   # note the leading capital /E
# before running the tests.  UWIN is a bit schizophrenic about case.
# It likes to return an uppercase "disk" letter for the leading directory,
# but your home directory may well have that in lower case.
# In most cases, they are entirely interchangeable, but the perl tests
# don't ignore case.  If they fail, change to the directory they expect.

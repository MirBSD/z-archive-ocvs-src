# Power MachTen is a real memory system and its standard malloc
# has been optimized for this. Using this malloc instead of Perl's
# malloc may result in significant memory savings.  In particular,
# unlike most UNIX memory allocation subsystems, MachTen's free()
# really does return unneeded process data memory to the system.
# However, MachTen's malloc() is woefully slow -- maybe 100 times
# slower than perl's own, so perl's own is usually the better
# choice.  In order to use perl's malloc(), the sbrk() system call
# must be simulated using MachTen's malloc().  See malloc.c for
# precise details of how this is achieved.  Recent improvements
# to perl's malloc() currently crash MachTen, and so are disabled
# by -DPLAIN_MALLOC and -DNO_FANCY_MALLOC.

# Set reg_infty -- the maximum allowable number of repeats in regular
# expressions such as  /a{1,$max_repeats}/, and the maximum number of
# times /a*/ will match.  Setting this too high without having a stack
# large enough to accommodate deep recursion in the regular expression
# engine allows perl to crash your Mac due to stack overrun if it
# encounters a pathological regular expression.  The default is a
# compromise between capability and required stack size (see below).
# You may override the default value from the Configure command-line
# like this:
#
#   Configure -Dreg_infty=16368 ...

reg_infty=${reg_infty:-2047}

# If you want to have many perl processes active simultaneously --
# processing CGI forms -- for example, you should opt for a small stack.
# For safety, you should set reg_infty no larger than the corresponding
# value given in this table:

# ...
#  16M        2**15-1 (32767) (perl's default value)

# This script selects a safe stack size based on the value of reg_infty
# specified above.  However, you may choose to take a risk and set
# stack size lower: pathological regular expressions are rare in real-world
# programs.  But be aware that, if perl does encounter one, it WILL
# crash your system.  Do not set stack size lower than 96k unless
# you want perl's installation tests ( make test ) to crash your system.

# While link counts on MachTen 4.1's fast file systems work correctly,

During Configure, you may see the message

*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for \$d_msg on this machine was "undef"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y]

as well as similar messages concerning \$d_sem and \$d_shm.  Select the
default answers: MachTen 4.1 appears to provide System V IPC support,
but it is incomplete and buggy: perl should be built without it.
Similar considerations apply to memory mapping of files, controlled
by \$d_mmap and \$d_munmap.

Similarly, when you see

*** WHOA THERE!!! ***
    The recommended value for \$d_vfork on this machine was "define"!
    Keep the recommended value? [y]

select the default answer: vfork() works, and avoids expensive data
copying.

You may also see "WHOA THERE!!!" messages concerning \$d_getspnam.
Select the default answer: MachTen's support for shadow password
file access is incomplete, and should not be used.

At the end of Configure, you will see a harmless message

Hmm...You had some extra variables I don't know about...I'll try to keep 'em.
	Propagating recommended variable dont_use_nlink
        Propagating recommended variable nmopts
        Propagating recommended variable malloc_cflags...
        Propagating recommended variable reg_infty
        Propagating recommended variable system_alloc_alignment
Read the File::Find documentation for more information about dont_use_nlink

Your perl will be built with a stack size of ${stack_size}k and a regular
expression repeat count limit of $reg_infty.  If you want alternative
values, see the file hints/machten.sh for advice on how to change them.

Tests
	io/fs test 4  and
	op/stat test 3
may fail since MachTen may not return a useful nlinks field to stat
on directories.

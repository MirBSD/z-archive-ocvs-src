# These hints work for NeXT 3.2 and 3.3.  3.0 has its own
# special hint file.

# THE MALLOC STORY
######################################################################
# 1994:
# the simple program `for ($i=1;$i<38771;$i++){$t{$i}=123}' fails
# with Larry's malloc on NS 3.2 due to broken sbrk()
#
# setting usemymalloc='n' was the solution back then. Later came
# reports that perl would run unstable on 3.2:
#
# 1996:
# From about perl5.002beta1h perl became unstable on the
# NeXT. Intermittent coredumps were frequent on 3.2 OS. There were
# reports, that the developer version of 3.3 didn't have problems, so it
# seemed pretty obvious that we had to work around an malloc bug in 3.2.
# This hints file reflects a patch to perl5.002_01 that introduces a
# home made sbrk routine (remember, NeXT's sbrk _never_ worked). This
# sbrk makes it possible to run perl with its own malloc. Thanks to
# Ilya who showed me the way to his sbrk for OS/2!!
#
# The whole malloc desaster lead to a failing gdbm test. It is far
# beyond my understanding, why GDBM_File breaks with the "fix", but in
# general I consider it better to have a working perl with broken GDBM
# than no perl at all.
#
# So, this hintsfile is using perl's malloc. If you want to turn
# perl's malloc off, you need to remove '-DUSE_PERL_SBRK'
# from the ccflags and set usemymalloc to 'n'.
#
# 1997:
# From perl5.003_22 the malloc bug has no impact any more. We can run
# a perl without a special sbrk. Apparently Chip Salzenberg, the hero
# of 5.004 anyway, earned another trophy during Australien Open.
#
# use the following two lines to enable USE_PERL_SBRK. Try this if you
# encounter intermittent core dumps:
#ccflags='-DUSE_NEXT_CTYPE -DUSE_PERL_SBRK'
#usemymalloc='y'
# use the following two lines if you have perl5.003_22 or better and
# do not encounter intermittent core dumps.

ccflags="$ccflags -DUSE_NEXT_CTYPE"
usemymalloc='n'

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

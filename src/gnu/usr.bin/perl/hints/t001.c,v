/* This test case is extracted from Perl version 5.7.3.  It is
   in the Perl_unpack_str function of the pp_pack.c source file.

   GCC 2.95.2 improperly assumes that it can compensate for an
   extra fsub by performing a fadd.  This would work in
   fixed-point arithmetic, but does not work in floating-point
   arithmetic.

   This problem has been seen on HP-UX and on Stratus VOS, both
   of which have an HP PA-RISC target (hppa1.1).  The Stratus
   bug number is gnu_g++-220.  */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

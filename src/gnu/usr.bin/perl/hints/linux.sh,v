# Debian and Red Hat, and perhaps other vendors, provide both runtime and
# development packages for some libraries.  The runtime packages contain shared
# libraries with version information in their names (e.g., libgdbm.so.1.7.3);
# the development packages supplement this with versionless shared libraries
# (e.g., libgdbm.so).
#
# If you want to link against such a library, you must install the development
# version of the package.
#
# These packages use a -dev naming convention in both Debian and Red Hat:
#   libgdbmg1  (non-development version of GNU libc 2-linked GDBM library)
#   libgdbmg1-dev (development version of GNU libc 2-linked GDBM library)
# So make sure that for any libraries you wish to link Perl with under
# Debian or Red Hat you have the -dev packages installed.
#
# Some operating systems (e.g., Solaris 2.6) will link to a versioned shared
# library implicitly.  For example, on Solaris, `ld foo.o -lgdbm' will find an
# appropriate version of libgdbm, if one is available; Linux, however, doesn't
# do the implicit mapping.
ignore_versioned_solibs='y'

# BSD compatability library no longer needed
# 'kaffe' has a /usr/lib/libnet.so which is not at all relevent for perl.

You appear to have ELF support.  I'll try to use it for dynamic loading.
If dynamic loading doesn't work, read hints/linux.sh for further information.

You don't have an ELF gcc.  I will use dld if possible.  If you are
using a version of DLD earlier than 3.2.6, or don't have it at all, you
should probably upgrade. If you are forced to use 3.2.4, you should
uncomment a couple of lines in hints/linux.sh and restart Configure so
that shared libraries will be disallowed.

    ## If you are using DLD 3.2.4 which does not support shared libs,
    ## uncomment the next two lines:
    #ldflags="-static"
    #so='none'

	# In addition, on some systems there is a problem with perl and NDBM
	# which causes AnyDBM and NDBM_File to lock up. This is evidenced 
	# in the tests as AnyDBM just freezing.  Apparently, this only 
	# happens on a.out systems, so we disable NDBM for all a.out linux
	# systems.  If someone can suggest a more robust test
	#  that would be appreciated.

	# I tried compiling with DBM support and sure enough things locked up
	# just as advertised. Checking into it, I found that the lockup was
	# during the call to dbm_open. Not *in* dbm_open -- but between the call
	# to and the jump into.
	# 
	# To make a long story short, making sure that the *.a and *.sa pairs of
	#   /usr/lib/lib{m,db,gdbm}.{a,sa}

Disabling ndbm.  This will generate a Whoa There message in Configure.
Read hints/linux.sh for further information.

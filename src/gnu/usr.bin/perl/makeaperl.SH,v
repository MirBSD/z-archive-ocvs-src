=head1 NAME

makeaperl - create a new perl binary from static extensions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<makeaperl -l library -m makefile -o target -t tempdir [object_files] [static_extensions] [search_directories]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is designed to build new perl binaries from existing
extensions on the fly. Called without any arguments it produces a new
binary with the name C<perl> in the current directory. Intermediate
files are produced in C</tmp>, if that is writeable, else in the
current directory. The most important intermediate file is a Makefile,
that is used internally to call C<make>. The new perl binary will consist

The C<-l> switch lets you specify the name of a perl library to be
linked into the new binary. If you do not specify a library, makeaperl
writes targets for any C<libperl*.a> it finds in the search path. The
topmost target will be the one related to C<libperl.a>.

With the C<-m> switch you can provide a name for the Makefile that
will be written (default C</tmp/Makefile.$$>). Likewise specifies the
C<-o> switch a name for the perl binary (default C<perl>). The C<-t>
switch lets you determine, in which directory the intermediate files
should be stored.

All object files and static extensions following on the command line
will be linked into the target file. If there are any directories
specified on the command line, these directories are searched for
C<*.a> files, and all of the found ones will be linked in, too. If
there is no directory named, then the contents of $INC[0] are
searched.

If the command fails, there is currently no other mechanism to adjust
the behaviour of the program than to alter the generated Makefile and
run C<make> by hand.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

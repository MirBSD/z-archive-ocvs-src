@Initial revision

@This directory contains the source code for the Perl extension
VMS::Stdio, which provides access from Perl to VMS-specific
stdio functions.  For more specific documentation of its
function, please see the pod section of Stdio.pm.

===> Installation

This extension, like most Perl extensions, should be installed
by copying the files in this directory to a location *outside*
the Perl distribution tree, and then saying

    $ perl Makefile.PL  ! Build Descrip.MMS for this extension
    $ MMK               ! Build the extension
    $ MMK test          ! Run its regression tests
    $ MMK install       ! Install required files in public Perl tree

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

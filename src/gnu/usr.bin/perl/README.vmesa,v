This document is written in pod format hence there are punctuation
characters in odd places.  Do not worry, you've apparently got
the ASCII->EBCDIC translation worked out correctly.  You can read
more about pod in pod/perlpod.pod or the short summary in the
INSTALL file.

=head1 NAME

README.vmesa - building and installing Perl for VM/ESA.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This document will help you Configure, build, test and install Perl
on VM/ESA.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a fully ported perl for VM/ESA 2.3.0.  It may work on
other versions, but that's the one we've tested it on.

If you've downloaded the binary distribution, it needs to be
installed below /usr/local.  Source code distributions have an
automated `make install` step that means you do not need to extract
the source code below /usr/local (though that is where it will be
installed by default).  You may need to worry about the networking
configuration files discussed in the last bullet below.

=head2 Unpacking Perl Distribution on VM/ESA

To extract an ASCII tar archive on VM/ESA, try this:

   pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r < latest.tar

=head2 Setup Perl and utilities on VM/ESA

GNU make for VM/ESA, which may be required for the build of perl,
is available from:

  http://pucc.princeton.edu/~neale/vmoe.html

=head2 Configure Perl on VM/ESA

Once you've unpacked the distribution, run Configure (see INSTALL for
full discussion of the Configure options), and then run make, then
"make test" then "make install" (this last step may require UID=0
privileges).

There is a "hints" file for vmesa that specifies the correct values
for most things.  Some things to watch out for are:

=over 4

=item *

this port does support dynamic loading but it's not had much testing

=item *

Don't turn on the compiler optimization flag "-O".  There's
a bug in the compiler (APAR PQ18812) that generates some bad code
the optimizer is on.

=item *

As VM/ESA doesn't fully support the fork() API programs relying on
this call will not work. I've replaced fork()/exec() with spawn()
and the standalone exec() with spawn(). This has a side effect when
opening unnamed pipes in a shell script: there is no child process
generated under.

=item *

At the moment the hints file for VM/ESA basically bypasses all of the
automatic configuration process.  This is because Configure relies on:
1. The header files living in the Byte File System (you could put the
there if you want); 2. The C preprocessor including the #include 
statements in the preprocessor output (.i) file.

=back

=head2 Testing Anomalies of Perl on VM/ESA

The `make test` step runs a Perl Verification Procedure, usually before
installation.  As the 5.6.1 kit was being assembled
the following "failures" were known to appear on some machines
during `make test` (mostly due to ASCII vs. EBCDIC conflicts),
your results may differ:

[the list of failures being compiled]

=head2 Usage Hints for Perl on VM/ESA

When using perl on VM/ESA please keep in mind that the EBCDIC and ASCII
character sets are different.  Perl builtin functions that may behave
differently under EBCDIC are mentioned in the perlport.pod document.

OpenEdition (UNIX System Services) does not (yet) support the #! means
of script invocation.
See:

    head `whence perldoc`

for an example of how to use the "eval exec" trick to ask the shell to
have perl run your scripts for you.

and POSIX-BC (BS2000) ports of Perl then see the perl-mvs mailing list.

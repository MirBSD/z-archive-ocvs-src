    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of either:

	a) the GNU General Public License as published by the Free

	later version, or

	b) the "Artistic License" which comes with this Kit.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See either
    the GNU General Public License or the Artistic License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the Artistic License with this
    Kit, in the file named "Artistic".  If not, I'll be glad to provide one.

    You should also have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program in the file named "Copying". If not, write to the 
    Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 
    02111-1307, USA or visit their web page on the internet at
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.

    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
    my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
    script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perl is a language that combines some of the features of C, sed, awk
and shell.  See the manual page for more hype.  There are also many Perl
books available, covering a wide variety of topics, from various publishers.
See pod/perlbook.pod for more information.

Please read all the directions below before you proceed any further, and
then follow them carefully.

After you have unpacked your kit, you should have all the files listed
in MANIFEST.

Installation

1) Detailed instructions are in the file "INSTALL", which you should
read if you are either installing on a system resembling Unix
or porting perl to another platform.  For non-Unix platforms, see the
corresponding README.

2) Read the manual entries before running perl.

3) IMPORTANT!  Help save the world!  Communicate any problems and suggested
patches to perlbug@@perl.org so we can keep the world in sync.
If you have a problem, there's someone else out there who either has had
or will have the same problem.  It's usually helpful if you send the
output of the "myconfig" script in the main perl directory.

If you've succeeded in compiling perl, the perlbug script in the "utils"
subdirectory can be used to help mail in a bug report.

If possible, send in patches such that the patch program will apply them.
Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs.  Don't send ed scripts--
I've probably changed my copy since the version you have.

The latest versions of perl are always available on the various CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites around the world.
See <URL:http://www.cpan.org/src/>.


Just a personal note:  I want you to know that I create nice things like this
because it pleases the Author of my story.  If this bothers you, then your
notion of Authorship needs some revision.  But you can use perl anyway. :-)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

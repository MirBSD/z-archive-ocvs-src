=head1 NAME

README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Classic).
If you are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be
here (unless you are in the Classic environment under Mac OS X).

When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean Mac OS 7, 8, and 9, and I<not>
Mac OS X.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The latest perl source itself builds on Mac OS, with some additional
pieces. Support for Mac OS is now in the perl core, and MacPerl is kept
in close sync with regular perl releases.

To build perl for Mac OS (as an MPW tool), you will need the addition
of the F<macos> subdirectory, distributed separately.  It includes extra
source files, config files, and make files.  It also includes extra
Mac-specific modules.

To build the MacPerl application, you will also need the F<macperl>
directory, which includes the source files for creating the
application itself.

All of this is available from the development site, via
HTTP (in the MacPerl Installer, which includes all the source
and binaries) and anonymous CVS.

	http://dev.macperl.org/

The source is also in the main perl repository in the macperl
branch (the 5.6 source is in the maint-5.6/macperl branch).

You will also need compilers and libraries, all of them freely
available.  These are linked to from the SourceForge site. Go that site
for all things having to do with MacPerl development.

MacPerl 5.6.1 and later are supported on Mac OS 8.1 and later, for 68040
and PowerPC architectures.  The MPW tool may be used on Mac OS 7.5.5
and 68030 computers.

MacPerl 5.2.0r4 is also available, on the CPAN and on SourceForge.  It
is based on perl 5.004, and works with Mac OS 7.5.5 and 68030 computers.


=head1 AUTHOR

perl was ported to Mac OS by Matthias Neeracher
E<lt>neeracher@@mac.comE<gt>.  It is currently maintained by Chris
Nandor E<lt>pudge@@pobox.comE<gt>.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

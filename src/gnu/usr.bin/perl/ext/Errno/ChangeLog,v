@Change 171 on 2000-09-12 by <calle@@lysator.liu.se> (Calle Dybedahl)

	- Fixed filename-extracting regexp to allow whitespace between
	  "#" and "line", which the cpp on Unicos 9 produces.

Change 170 on 1998/07/05 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Fixed three problems reported by Hans Mulder for NeXT
	
	- Errno_pm.PL does not recognize #define lines because they have
	  whitespace before the '#'.  ANSI does not allow that in portable
	  code; that didn't stop the author of NeXT's <errno.h>.
	
	- Cpp output lines look like this:	#1 "errno.c"
	  Errno_pm.PL does not recognize that format; it wants whitespace
	  before the line number.
	
	- Cpp does a syntax check on files with names ending in ".c"; it
	  reports fatal errors on input lines like:	"ENOSYS" [[ENOSYS]]
	  Workaround: use $Config{cppstdin}, like Errno 1.04 did.

Change 160 on 1998/06/27 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	- Added patch from Sarathy to support Win32
	- Changed use of $Config{cpp} to $Config{cpprun} as suggested by
	  Tom Horsley

Change 159 on 1998/06/27 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	- Changed to use cpp to locate required files
	- Moved dummy Errno.pm file into d/
	- Added support for VMS

Change 158 on 1998/06/27 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Rename errno.pl to Errno_pm.PL

Change 146 on 1998/05/31 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Added ChangeLog to MANIFEST

Change 140 on 1998/05/23 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Fix type in errno.pl

Change 139 on 1998/05/23 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Moved code to generate Errno.pm into errno.pl

Change 136 on 1998/05/19 by <gbarr@@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Changed to use cpp to locate constants
	
	Added t/errno.t

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

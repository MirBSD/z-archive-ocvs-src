@Initial revision

@At entry to each basic block, the following can be assumed (and hence
must be forced where necessary at the end of each basic block):

The shadow stack @@stack is empty.
For each lexical object in @@pad, VALID_IV holds for each T_INT,
VALID_DOUBLE holds for each T_DOUBLE and VALID_SV holds otherwise.
The C shadow variable sp holds the stack pointer (not necessarily stack_sp).

write_back_stack
    Writes the contents of the shadow stack @@stack back to the real stack.
    A write-back of each object in the stack is forced so that its
    backing SV contains the right value and that SV is then pushed onto the
    real stack. On return, @@stack is empty.

write_back_lexicals
    Forces a write-back (i.e. achieves VALID_SV), where necessary, for each
    lexical object in @@pad. Objects with the TEMPORARY flag are skipped. If
    write_back_lexicals is called with an (optional) argument, then it is
    taken to be a bitmask of more flags: any lexical object with one of those
    flags set is also skipped and not written back to its SV.

invalidate_lexicals($avoid)
    The VALID_INT and VALID_DOUBLE flags are turned off for each lexical
    object in @@pad whose flags field doesn't overlap with $avoid.

reload_lexicals
    For each necessary lexical object in @@pad, makes sure that VALID_IV
    holds for objects of type T_INT, VALID_DOUBLE holds for objects for
    type T_DOUBLE, and VALID_SV holds for other objects. An object is
    considered for reloading if its flags field does not overlap with the
    (optional) argument passed to reload_lexicals.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

package MIME::QuotedPrint;

=head1 NAME

MIME::QuotedPrint - Encoding and decoding of quoted-printable strings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use MIME::QuotedPrint;

 $encoded = encode_qp($decoded);
 $decoded = decode_qp($encoded);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to encode and decode strings into the
Quoted-Printable encoding specified in RFC 2045 - I<MIME (Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions)>.  The Quoted-Printable encoding is intended
to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to
printable characters in the ASCII character set.  Non-printable
characters (as defined by english americans) are represented by a
triplet consisting of the character "=" followed by two hexadecimal
digits.

The following functions are provided:

=over 4

=item encode_qp($str)

This function will return an encoded version of the string given as
argument.

Note that encode_qp() does not change newlines C<"\n"> to the CRLF
sequence even though this might be considered the right thing to do
(RFC 2045 (Q-P Rule #4)).

=item decode_qp($str);

This function will return the plain text version of the string given
as argument.

=back


If you prefer not to import these routines into your namespace you can
call them as:

  use MIME::QuotedPrint ();
  $encoded = MIME::QuotedPrint::encode($decoded);
  $decoded = MIME::QuotedPrint::decode($encoded);

The second argument is the line ending sequence to use.  It is
optional and defaults to "\n".  Every occurence of "\n" will be
replaced with this string and it will also be used for additional
"soft line breaks" to ensure that no line is longer than 76
characters.  You might want to pass it as "\015\012" to produce data
suitable external consumption.  The string "\r\n" will produce the
same result on many platforms, but not all.

An $eol of "" special.  If passed no "soft line breaks" are introduced
and any literal "\n" in the original data is encoded as well.

the $str argument contains "\r\n" terminated lines.

Perl v5.6 and better allow extended Unicode characters in strings.
Such strings cannot be encoded directly as the quoted-printable
encoding is only defined for bytes.  The solution is to use the Encode
module to select the byte encoding you want.  For example:

    use MIME::QuotedPrint qw(encode_qp);
    use Encode qw(encode);

    $encoded = encode_qp(encode("UTF-8", "\x{FFFF}\n"));
    print $encoded;

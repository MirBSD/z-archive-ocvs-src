    it under the same terms as Perl 5 itself.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

+=======================================================================
| Storable is distributed as a module, but is also part of the official
| Perl core distribution, as of perl 5.8. 
| Maintenance is now done by the perl5-porters.  We thank Raphael
| Manfredi for providing us with this very useful module.
+=======================================================================

The Storable extension brings persistency to your data.

You may recursively store to disk any data structure, no matter how
complex and circular it is, provided it contains only SCALAR, ARRAY,
HASH (possibly tied) and references (possibly blessed) to those items.

At a later stage, or in another program, you may retrieve data from
the stored file and recreate the same hiearchy in memory. If you
had blessed references, the retrieved references are blessed into
the same package, so you must make sure you have access to the
same perl class than the one used to create the relevant objects.

There is also a dclone() routine which performs an optimized mirroring
of any data structure, preserving its topology.

Objects (blessed references) may also redefine the way storage and
retrieval is performed, and/or what deep cloning should do on those
objects.

To compile this extension, run:

    perl Makefile.PL [PERL_SRC=...where you put perl sources...]
    make
    make install

There is an embeded POD manual page in Storable.pm.

Storable was written by Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@@pobox.com>
Maitainance is now done by the perl5-porters <perl5-porters@@perl.org>

Please e-mail us with problems, bug fixes, comments and complaints,
although if you have complements you should send them to Raphael.
Please don't e-mail Raphael with problems, as he no longer works on
Storable, and your message will be delayed while he forwards it to us.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

@Revision history for Perl extension File::Glob

0.00  Tue Dec 17 10:51:33 1996
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16

0.90  Tue Dec 17 13:58:32 MST 1996
	- implemented first pass access to glob(3),
	  but it's clumsy and it looks like it leaks
	  memory.

0.91  Thu Sep  4 08:43:55 CDT 1997
	- included CORE/config.h portability macros
	- s/glob/bsd_glob/ to avoid calling and including the
	  system's glob stuff
	- added GLOB_DEBUG for (surprise!) glob debugging
	- tainted all filenames returned from &Glob::BSD::glob

0.92  Tue Sep 30 08:31:57 CDT 1997
	- only use lstat if HAS_LSTAT is defined
	- renamed the glob flags to GLOB_*
	- added GLOB_CSH convenience macro for csh(1) globbing
	These changes thanks to Hans Mulder <hansm@@icgned.nl>
	- fixed an incompatibility with csh(1) globbing where a
	  pattern like {A*,b,c} wouldn't expand properly
	- various compatibility changes
	- fixed and added tests

0.93  Wed Jul  1 10:39:47 CDT 1998
	- renamed module to File::BSDGlob
	- enabled 'globally' import directive to override the core
	  glob
	- added Sarathy's tests for File::DosGlob
0.99  Tue Oct 12 06:42:02 PDT 1999
	- renamed module to File::Glob for incorporation into the
	  Perl source distribution
	- ansified prototypes
	- s/struct stat/Stat_t/
	- split on spaces to make <*.c *.h> work (for compatibility)
0.991 Tue Oct 26 09:48:00 BST 1999
	- Add case-insensitive matching (GLOB_NOCASE)
	- Make glob_csh case insensitive by default on Win32, VMS,
	  OS/2, DOS, RISC OS, and Mac OS
	- Add support for :case and :nocase tags
	- Hack to make patterns like C:* work on DOSISH systems
	- Add support for either \ or / as separators on DOSISH systems
	- Limit effect of \ as a quoting operator on DOSISH systems to
	  when it precedes one of []{}-~\ (to minimise backslashitis).
0.992 Tue Mar 20 09:25:48 2001
	- Add alphabetic sorting for csh compatibility (GLOB_ALPHASORT)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

=head1 NAME

Unicode::Normalize - Unicode Normalization Forms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Normalize;

  $NFD_string  = NFD($string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = NFC($string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = NFKD($string); # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = NFKC($string); # Normalization Form KC

   or

  use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';

  $NFD_string  = normalize('D',  $string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = normalize('C',  $string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = normalize('KD', $string);  # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = normalize('KC', $string);  # Normalization Form KC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Normalization Forms

=over 4

=item C<$NFD_string = NFD($string)>

returns the Normalization Form D (formed by canonical decomposition).

=item C<$NFC_string = NFC($string)>

returns the Normalization Form C (formed by canonical decomposition
followed by canonical composition).

=item C<$NFKD_string = NFKD($string)>

returns the Normalization Form KD (formed by compatibility decomposition).

=item C<$NFKC_string = NFKC($string)>

returns the Normalization Form KC (formed by compatibility decomposition
followed by B<canonical> composition).

=item C<$normalized_string = normalize($form_name, $string)>

As C<$form_name>, one of the following names must be given.

  'C'  or 'NFC'  for Normalization Form C
  'D'  or 'NFD'  for Normalization Form D
  'KC' or 'NFKC' for Normalization Form KC
  'KD' or 'NFKD' for Normalization Form KD

=back

=head2 Decomposition and Composition

=over 4

=item C<$decomposed_string = decompose($string)>

=item C<$decomposed_string = decompose($string, $useCompatMapping)>

Decompose the specified string and returns the result.

If the second parameter (a boolean) is omitted or false, decomposes it
using the Canonical Decomposition Mapping.
If true, decomposes it using the Compatibility Decomposition Mapping.

The string returned is not always in NFD/NFKD.
Reordering may be required.

    $NFD_string  = reorder(decompose($string));       # eq. to NFD()
    $NFKD_string = reorder(decompose($string, TRUE)); # eq. to NFKD()

=item C<$reordered_string  = reorder($string)>

Reorder the combining characters and the like in the canonical ordering
and returns the result.

E.g., when you have a list of NFD/NFKD strings,
you can get the concatenated NFD/NFKD string from them, saying

    $concat_NFD  = reorder(join '', @@NFD_strings);
    $concat_NFKD = reorder(join '', @@NFKD_strings);

=item C<$composed_string   = compose($string)>

Returns the string where composable pairs are composed.

E.g., when you have a NFD/NFKD string,
you can get its NFC/NFKC string, saying

    $NFC_string  = compose($NFD_string);
    $NFKC_string = compose($NFKD_string);

=back

=head2 Quick Check

(see Annex 8, UAX #15; F<DerivedNormalizationProps.txt>)

The following functions check whether the string is in that normalization form.

The result returned will be:

    YES     The string is in that normalization form.
    NO      The string is not in that normalization form.
    MAYBE   Dubious. Maybe yes, maybe no.

=over 4

=item C<$result = checkNFD($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>) or C<NO> (C<empty string>).

=item C<$result = checkNFC($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

=item C<$result = checkNFKD($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>) or C<NO> (C<empty string>).

=item C<$result = checkNFKC($string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

=item C<$result = check($form_name, $string)>

returns C<YES> (C<1>), C<NO> (C<empty string>), or C<MAYBE> (C<undef>).

C<$form_name> is alike to that for C<normalize()>.

=back

B<Note>

In the cases of NFD and NFKD, the answer must be either C<YES> or C<NO>.
The answer C<MAYBE> may be returned in the cases of NFC and NFKC.

A MAYBE-NFC/NFKC string should contain at least
one combining character or the like.
For example, C<COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT> has
the MAYBE_NFC/MAYBE_NFKC property.
Both C<checkNFC("A\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}")>
and C<checkNFC("B\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}")> will return C<MAYBE>.
C<"A\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}"> is not in NFC
(its NFC is C<"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE}">),
while C<"B\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}"> is in NFC.

If you want to check exactly, compare the string with its NFC/NFKC; i.e.,

    $string eq NFC($string)    # more thorough than checkNFC($string)
    $string eq NFKC($string)   # more thorough than checkNFKC($string)

=head2 Character Data

These functions are interface of character data used internally.
If you want only to get Unicode normalization forms, you don't need
call them yourself.

=over 4

=item C<$canonical_decomposed = getCanon($codepoint)>

If the character of the specified codepoint is canonically
decomposable (including Hangul Syllables),
returns the B<completely decomposed> string canonically equivalent to it.

If it is not decomposable, returns C<undef>.

=item C<$compatibility_decomposed = getCompat($codepoint)>

If the character of the specified codepoint is compatibility
decomposable (including Hangul Syllables),
returns the B<completely decomposed> string compatibility equivalent to it.

If it is not decomposable, returns C<undef>.

=item C<$codepoint_composite = getComposite($codepoint_here, $codepoint_next)>

If two characters here and next (as codepoints) are composable
(including Hangul Jamo/Syllables and Composition Exclusions),
returns the codepoint of the composite.

If they are not composable, returns C<undef>.

=item C<$combining_class = getCombinClass($codepoint)>

Returns the combining class of the character as an integer.

=item C<$is_exclusion = isExclusion($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the character of the specified codepoint
is a composition exclusion.

=item C<$is_singleton = isSingleton($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the character of the specified codepoint is
a singleton.

=item C<$is_non_startar_decomposition = isNonStDecomp($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the canonical decomposition
of the character of the specified codepoint
is a Non-Starter Decomposition.

=item C<$may_be_composed_with_prev_char = isComp2nd($codepoint)>

Returns a boolean whether the character of the specified codepoint
may be composed with the previous one in a certain composition
(including Hangul Compositions, but excluding
Composition Exclusions and Non-Starter Decompositions).

Parameters:

C<$string> is used as a string under character semantics
(see F<perlunicode>).

C<$codepoint> should be an unsigned integer
representing a Unicode code point.

Note: Between XS edition and pure Perl edition,
interpretation of C<$codepoint> as a decimal number has incompatibility.
XS converts C<$codepoint> to an unsigned integer, but pure Perl does not.
Do not use a floating point nor a negative sign in C<$codepoint>.

a119 14
=item C<$FCD_string = FCD($string)>

If the given string is in FCD ("Fast C or D" form; cf. UTN #5),
returns it without modification; otherwise returns an FCD string.

Note: FCD is not always unique, then plural forms may be equivalent
each other. C<FCD()> will return one of these equivalent forms.

=item C<$FCC_string = FCC($string)>

returns the FCC form ("Fast C Contiguous"; cf. UTN #5).

Note: FCD is unique, as well as four normalization forms (NF*).

If a string is not in C<FCD>, it must not be in <FCC>.
So C<checkFCC($not_FCD_string)> should return C<NO>.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

    - XSUB: even if string contains a malformed, "short" Unicode character,

      (keep your code with <no warnings 'utf8';>);
      but porting is not successful in the case of ((Pure Perl) and
      (Perl 5.7.3 or before)).

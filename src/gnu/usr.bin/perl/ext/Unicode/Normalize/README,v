@Unicode/Normalize version 0.17
===================================

Unicode::Normalize - Unicode Normalization Forms

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Normalize;

  $NFD_string  = NFD($string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = NFC($string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = NFKD($string); # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = NFKC($string); # Normalization Form KC


  or


  use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';

  $NFD_string  = normalize('D',  $string);  # Normalization Form D
  $NFC_string  = normalize('C',  $string);  # Normalization Form C
  $NFKD_string = normalize('KD', $string);  # Normalization Form KD
  $NFKC_string = normalize('KC', $string);  # Normalization Form KC


INSTALLATION

Perl 5.6 or later

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have a C compiler and want to use the XS version,
type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL xs
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install the NoXS version after trying to build the XS,
type the following:

   make clean
   perl Makefile.PL noxs
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Carp
Exporter
File::Copy
File::Spec

unicore/CombiningClass.pl         (or unicode/CombiningClass.pl)
unicore/Decomposition.pl          (or unicode/Decomposition.pl)
unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt (or unicode/CompExcl.txt)

CAVEAT

(1) In the perl-current, unicore/CompExcl.txt
  is renamed unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt.

(2) When these unicore/*.* files are updated;

  in the case of an XS version:
    You must rebuild the module,
    as the data will be compiled on building.

  in the case of a NoXS version:
    Rebuilding is not necessary,
    as the data will be read on requirement.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

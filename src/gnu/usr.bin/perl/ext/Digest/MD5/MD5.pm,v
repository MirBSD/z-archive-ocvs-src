=head1 NAME

Digest::MD5 - Perl interface to the MD5 Algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Functional style
 use Digest::MD5  qw(md5 md5_hex md5_base64);

 $digest = md5($data);
 $digest = md5_hex($data);
 $digest = md5_base64($data);

 # OO style
 use Digest::MD5;

 $ctx = Digest::MD5->new;

 $ctx->add($data);
 $ctx->addfile(*FILE);

 $digest = $ctx->digest;
 $digest = $ctx->hexdigest;
 $digest = $ctx->b64digest;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Digest::MD5> module allows you to use the RSA Data Security
Inc. MD5 Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs.  The
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as
output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

The C<Digest::MD5> module provide a procedural interface for simple
use, as well as an object oriented interface that can handle messages
of arbitrary length and which can read files directly.

A binary digest will be 16 bytes long.  A hex digest will be 32
characters long.  A base64 digest will be 22 characters long.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions can be exported from the C<Digest::MD5>
module.  No functions are exported by default.

=over 4

=item md5($data,...)

This function will concatenate all arguments, calculate the MD5 digest
of this "message", and return it in binary form.

=item md5_hex($data,...)

Same as md5(), but will return the digest in hexadecimal form.

=item md5_base64($data,...)

Same as md5(), but will return the digest as a base64 encoded string.

The base64 encoded string returned is not padded to be a multiple of 4
bytes long.  If you want interoperability with other base64 encoded
md5 digests you might want to append the string "==" to the result.

=back

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $md5 = Digest::MD5->new

The constructor returns a new C<Digest::MD5> object which encapsulate
the state of the MD5 message-digest algorithm.  You can add data to
the object and finally ask for the digest.

If called as an instance method (i.e. $md5->new) it will just reset the
state the object to the state of a newly created object.  No new
object is created in this case.

=item $md5->reset

This is just an alias for $md5->new.

=item $md5->add($data,...)

The $data provided as argument are appended to the message we
calculate the digest for.  The return value is the $md5 object itself.

=item $md5->addfile($io_handle)

The $io_handle is read until EOF and the content is appended to the
message we calculate the digest for.  The return value is the $md5
object itself.

In most cases you want to make sure that the $io_handle is set up to
be in binmode().

=item $md5->digest

Return the binary digest for the message.

Note that the C<digest> operation is effectively a destructive,
read-once operation. Once it has been performed, the C<Digest::MD5>
object is automatically C<reset> and can be used to calculate another
digest value.

=item $md5->hexdigest

Same as $md5->digest, but will return the digest in hexadecimal form.

=item $md5->b64digest

Same as $md5->digest, but will return the digest as a base64 encoded
string.

The base64 encoded string returned is not padded to be a multiple of 4
bytes long.  If you want interoperability with other base64 encoded
md5 digests you might want to append the string "==" to the result.

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

The simplest way to use this library is to import the md5_hex()
function (or one of its cousins):

    use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);
    print "Digest is ", md5_hex("foobarbaz"), "\n";

The above example would print out the message

    Digest is 6df23dc03f9b54cc38a0fc1483df6e21

provided that the implementation is working correctly.  The same
checksum can also be calculated in OO style:

    use Digest::MD5;
    
    $md5 = Digest::MD5->new;
    $md5->add('foo', 'bar');
    $md5->add('baz');
    $digest = $md5->hexdigest;
    
    print "Digest is $digest\n";

With OO style you can break the message arbitrary.  This means that we
are no longer limited to have space for the whole message in memory, i.e.
we can handle messages of any size.

This is useful when calculating checksum for files:

    use Digest::MD5;

    my $file = shift || "/etc/passwd";
    open(FILE, $file) or die "Can't open '$file': $!";
    binmode(FILE);

    $md5 = Digest::MD5->new;
    while (<FILE>) {
        $md5->add($_);
    }
    close(FILE);
    print $md5->b64digest, " $file\n";

Or we can use the builtin addfile method for more efficient reading of
the file:

    use Digest::MD5;

    my $file = shift || "/etc/passwd";
    open(FILE, $file) or die "Can't open '$file': $!";
    binmode(FILE);

    print Digest::MD5->new->addfile(*FILE)->hexdigest, " $file\n";

The object oriented interface to C<Digest::MD5> is described in this
section.  After a C<Digest::MD5> object has been created, you will add
data to it and finally ask for the digest in a suitable format.  A
single object can be used to calculate multiple digests.

The following methods are provided:

the state of the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
a123 13
=item $md5->clone

This a copy of the $md5 object. It is useful when you do not want to
destroy the digests state, but need an intermediate value of the
digest, e.g. when calculating digests iteratively on a continuous data
stream.  Example:

    my $md5 = Digest::MD5->new;
    while (<>) {
	$md5->add($_);
	print "Line $.: ", $md5->clone->hexdigest, "\n";
    }

a128 8
All these lines will have the same effect on the state of the $md5
object:

    $md5->add("a"); $md5->add("b"); $md5->add("c");
    $md5->add("a")->add("b")->add("c");
    $md5->add("a", "b", "c");
    $md5->add("abc");

The $io_handle will be read until EOF and its content appended to the

The addfile() method will croak() if it fails reading data for some
reason.  If it croaks it is unpredictable what the state of the $md5
object will be in. The addfile() method might have been able to read
the file partially before it failed.  It is probably wise to discard
or reset the $md5 object if this occurs.

In most cases you want to make sure that the $io_handle is in
C<binmode> before you pass it as argument to the addfile() method.

Perl 5.8 support Unicode characters in strings.  Since the MD5
algorithm is only defined for strings of bytes, it can not be used on
strings that contains chars with ordinal number above 255.  The MD5
functions and methods will croak if you try to feed them such input
data:

    use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);

    my $str = "abc\x{300}";
    print md5_hex($str), "\n";  # croaks
    # Wide character in subroutine entry

What you can do is calculate the MD5 checksum of the UTF-8
representation of such strings.  This is achieved by filtering the
string through encode_utf8() function:

    use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);
    use Encode qw(encode_utf8);

    my $str = "abc\x{300}";
    print md5_hex(encode_utf8($str)), "\n";

Since the MD5 algorithm is byte oriented you might only add bits as
multiples of 8, so you probably want to just use add() instead.  The
add_bits() method is provided for compatibility with other digest
implementations.  See L<Digest> for description of the arguments
that add_bits() take.

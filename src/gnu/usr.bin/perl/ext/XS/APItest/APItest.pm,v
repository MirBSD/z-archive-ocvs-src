=head1 NAME

XS::APItest - Test the perl C API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XS::APItest;
  print_double(4);

=head1 ABSTRACT

This module tests the perl C API. Currently tests that C<printf>
works correctly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to check that the perl C API is behaving
correctly. This module provides test functions and an associated
test script that verifies the output.

This module is not meant to be installed.

=head2 EXPORT

Exports all the test functions:

=over 4

=item B<print_double>

Test that a double-precision floating point number is formatted
correctly by C<printf>.

  print_double( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<print_long_double>

Test that a C<long double> is formatted correctly by
C<printf>. Takes no arguments - the test value is hard-wired
into the function (as "7").

  print_long_double();

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<have_long_double>

Determine whether a C<long double> is supported by Perl.  This should
be used to determine whether to test C<print_long_double>.

  print_long_double() if have_long_double;

=item B<print_nv>

Test that an C<NV> is formatted correctly by
C<printf>.

  print_nv( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<print_iv>

Test that an C<IV> is formatted correctly by
C<printf>.

  print_iv( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<print_uv>

Test that an C<UV> is formatted correctly by
C<printf>.

  print_uv( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<print_int>

Test that an C<int> is formatted correctly by
C<printf>.

  print_int( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<print_long>

Test that an C<long> is formatted correctly by
C<printf>.

  print_long( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

=item B<print_float>

Test that a single-precision floating point number is formatted
correctly by C<printf>.

  print_float( $val );

Output is sent to STDOUT.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

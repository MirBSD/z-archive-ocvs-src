@package XS::Typemap;

=head1 NAME

XS::Typemap - module to test the XS typemaps distributed with perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XS::Typemap;

  $output = T_IV( $input );
  $output = T_PV( $input );
  @@output = T_ARRAY( @@input );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used to test that the XS typemaps distributed
with perl are working as advertised. A function is available
for each typemap definition (eventually). In general each function
takes a variable, processes it through the OUTPUT typemap and then
returns it using the INPUT typemap.

A test script can then compare the input and output to make sure they
are the expected values. When only an input or output function is
provided the function will be named after the typemap entry and have
either '_IN' or '_OUT' appended.

All the functions are exported. There is no reason not to do this since
the entire purpose is for testing Perl. Namespace pollution will be limited
to the test script.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

*** Release 1.16

Mon 15 Sep 1997 <gbarr@@pobox.com> Graham Barr

	o New modules
	  - IO::Dir
	  - IO::Poll

	o IO::Socket
	  - Changed new to call autoflush on the new socket
	  - IO::Socket::INET->new now accepts a single argument
	  - IO::Socket::INET default to protocol 'tcp'
	
	o IO::File
	  - Added doc for new_tmpfile
	
	o IO::Handle
	  - Removed use of AutoLoader for constants, constants are
	    now defined as constant XS subs
	  - Added fsync, but will not be avaliable for use
	    unless HAS_FSYNC is defined, perls configure does not define
	    this yet.
	  - Moved bootstrap of IO.xs to IO.pm. IO::Handle no longer
	    contains an AUTOLOAD sub in it's ISA hier

	o IO::Seekable
	  - Remove clearerr, as it is defined in IO.xs

	o IO.xs
	  - Patched IO.xs with patch from Chip for setvbuf warning
	  - Added XS sub "constant" for backwards compatability

	o Misc
	  - Fixed IO::Socket::configure, it was not passing $arg to domain
	    specific package
	  - Changed all $fh variables in IO::Handle to $io and all $fh
	    variables in IO::Socket to $sock as Chip suggested
	  - Fixed usage messages to be consistant

*** Release 1.15

Sun 19 Jan 1997 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Updated PODs for IO::Handle and IO::File
	o Modified IO.xs so that DESTROY gets called on IO::File
	  objects that were created with IO::File->new_tmpfile
	o Modified the domain2pkg code in IO::Socket so that it
	  does not use blessd refs
	o Created a new package IO::Pipe::End so that pipe specific
	  stuff can be moved out of IO::Handle.
	o Added Ilya's OS/2 changes to Pipe.pm and io_pipe.t

	o These changes happened somtime before the release of 1.15
	  - added shutdown to IO::Socket
	  - modified connect to not use alarm
	  - modified accept and connect to use IO::Select

*** Release 1.14

Tue 24 Dec 1996 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Updated to patches in perl core dist.
	o Added C<use strict> to all modules
	o Modified t/io_sock.t, hopefully the race condition has gone
	o Added close statements to reader/writer in IO::Pipe
	o IO::Handle::syswrite was calling sysread, fixed :-)

*** Release 1.12

Thu 19 Sep 1996 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Modified IO.xs so that it will compile with pre perlio version
	  of perl (ie pre perl5.003_02)
	o Modified IO::Socket::send so not to pass 4 arguments to send
	  if the socket is connected

*** Release 1.10

Mon 11 Sep 1996 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Fixed a bug in IO::Socket which caused DESTROY to be called
	  on a partly initialised connection
	o Changed IO.xs to use Perlio
	o Modified usage message to report correct package
	o Added IO::File::new changes from Chip, to allow PERM to be passed
	o Added sysread and syswrite methods to IO::Handle
	o Updated documentation
	o Fixed a bug in IO::Select that caused a hang if the last handle
	  was removed.
	o Added count method to IO::Select
	o Renamed and modified tests so that they can be copied into the
	  perl distribution
	o Added fcntl and ioctl methods to IO::Handle

Thu 25 Jul 1996 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o It is now not necessary to call the domain sub-classes of
	  IO::Socket. when connect is called it notes the domain.
	  Domain specific methods, which are normally non-critical, are
	  called via this note-ing.
	o Added methods to IO::Socket to retrieve the domain, type and
	  protocol of a given socket

Tue 23 Jul 1996 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o IO::Socket::connect changed how we do timeouts, as it did not work

	o IO::Handle::new_from_fd removed method call to _ref_fd, which was
	  a leftover from FileHandle

Fri 28 Jun 1996 <bodg@@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Modified IO::Socket::UNIX::configure to default to using a socket
	  type of SOCK_STREAM if no type is specified.

=head1 NAME

IO - load various IO modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Currently this includes:

      IO::Handle
      IO::Seekable
      IO::File
      IO::Pipe
      IO::Socket

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

C<IO> provides a simple mechanism to load several of the IO modules
in one go.  The IO modules belonging to the core are:
a41 6
      IO::Select
      IO::Poll

Some other IO modules don't belong to the perl core but can be loaded
as well if they have been installed from CPAN.  You can discover which
ones exist by searching for "^IO::" on http://search.cpan.org.

=head1 DEPRECATED

    use IO;                # loads all the modules listed below

The loaded modules are IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, IO::File, IO::Pipe,
IO::Socket, IO::Dir.  You should instead explicitly import the IO
modules you want.

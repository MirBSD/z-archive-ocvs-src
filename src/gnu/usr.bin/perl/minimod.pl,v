=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::Miniperl, writemain - write the C code for perlmain.c

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<use ExtUtils::Miniperl;>

C<writemain(@@directories);>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This whole module is written when perl itself is built from a script
called minimod.PL. In case you want to patch it, please patch
minimod.PL in the perl distribution instead.

writemain() takes an argument list of directories containing archive
libraries that relate to perl modules and should be linked into a new
perl binary. It writes to STDOUT a corresponding perlmain.c file that
is a plain C file containing all the bootstrap code to make the
modules associated with the libraries available from within perl.

The typical usage is from within a Makefile generated by
ExtUtils::MakeMaker. So under normal circumstances you won't have to
deal with this module directly.

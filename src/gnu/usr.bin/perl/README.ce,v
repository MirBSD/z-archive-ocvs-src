@If you read this file _as_is_, just ignore the funny characters you
see.  It is written in the POD format (see pod/perlpod.pod) which is
specifically designed to be readable as is.

=head1 Name

Perl for WinCE

=head1 Description

This file gives the instructions for building Perl5.6 and above for
WinCE.  Please read and understand the terms under which this
software is distributed.

=head1 Build

This section describes the steps to be performed to build PerlCE.

=head2 Tools & SDK

For compiling, you need Microsoft Embedded Visual Tools, my
celib-sources, my console-sources and a perl for win32.

Needed source files can be downloaded via:
www.rainer-keuchel.de/wince/dirlist.html

Some portions of the makefile need a shell for win32, rm, cp, mv,
xmkdir (mkdir with a -p option).  It also uses my cecopy program for
copying files to the ce device.

=head2 Make

Miniperl is not built. A pre-existent win32 perl is used.

The paths for tools and additional libraries have to be changed in
wince/makefile.ce.

Different ce targets can be specified with the TARGET macro.

Before you start, you need to build celib.dll and w32console.
See instructions in these packages for building.

In the wince directory, type "nmake -f makefile.ce". This should
build perl.exe and perl.dll. For building extension dlls,
type "nmake -f makefile.ce dlls"

When building ext dlls, you get lots of macro redefinition
errors. Just ignore them.

For further information, look in the text files in the wince
sub-directory.

=head1 Acknowledgements

The port for Win32 was used as a reference.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

This file gives the instructions for building Perl5.8 and above for
a17 10
You may find additional and newer information about building perl
for WinCE using following URL:

  http://perlce.sourceforge.net

There should also be pre-built binaries there.

Don't be confused by large size of downloaded distribution or constructed
binaries: entire distribution could be large for WinCE ideology, but
you may strip it at your wish and use only required parts.

For compiling, you need following:

=over 4

=item * Microsoft Embedded Visual Tools

=item * Microsoft Visual C++

=item * Rainer Keuchel's celib-sources

=item * Rainer Keuchel's console-sources

=back

Please pay attention that starting from 5.8.0 miniperl *is* built
and it facilitates in further building process. This means that
in addition to compiler installation for mobile device you also need
to have Microsoft Visual C++ installed as well.

On the bright side, you do not need to edit any files from ./win32
subdirectory. Normally you only need to edit ./wince/compile.bat
to reflect your system and run it.

File ./wince/compile.bat is actually a wrapper to call
nmake -f makefile.ce with appropriate parameters and it accepts extra
parameters and forwards them to "nmake" command as additional
arguments. You should pass target this way.

To prepare distribution you need to do following:
d35 2
a36 1
=over 4
d38 1
a38 1
=item * go to ./wince subdirectory
d40 2
a41 1
=item * edit file compile.bat
d43 3
a45 2
=item * run 
  compile.bat
d47 2
a48 2
=item * run 
  compile.bat dist
d50 2
a51 50
=back

makefile.ce has CROSS_NAME macro, and it is used further to refer to
your cross-compilation scheme. You could assign a name to it, but this
is not necessary, because by default it is assigned after your machine
configuration name, such as "wince-sh3-hpc-wce211", and this is enough
to distinguish different builds at the same time. This option could be
handy for several different builds on same platform to perform, say,
threaded build. In a following example we assume that all required
environment variables are set properly for C cross-compiler (a special
*.bat file could fit perfectly to this purpose) and your compile.bat
has proper "MACHINE" parameter set, to, say, "wince-mips-pocket-wce300".

  compile.bat
  compile.bat dist
  compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" "USE_IMP_SYS=define" "USE_MULTI=define"
  compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" "USE_IMP_SYS=define" "USE_MULTI=define" dist

If all goes okay and no errors during a build, you'll get two independent
distributions: "wince-mips-pocket-wce300" and "mips-wce300-thr".

Target 'dist' prepares distribution file set. Target 'zipdist' performs
same as 'dist' but additionally compresses distribution files into zip
archive.

NOTE: during a build there could be created a number (or one) of Config.pm
for cross-compilation ("foreign" Config.pm) and those are hidden inside
../xlib/$(CROSS_NAME) with other auxilary files, but, and this is important to
note, there should be *no* Config.pm for host miniperl.
If you'll get an error that perl could not find Config.pm somewhere in building
process this means something went wrong. Most probably you forgot to
specify a cross-compilation when invoking miniperl.exe to Makefile.PL
When building an extension for cross-compilation your command line should
look like

  ..\miniperl.exe -I..\lib -MCross=mips-wce300-thr Makefile.PL

or just

  ..\miniperl.exe -I..\lib -MCross Makefile.PL

to refer a cross-compilation that was created last time.


If you decided to build with fcrypt.c file, please refer to README.win32
file, as long as all legal considerations and steps to do are exactly same 
in this case.

All questions related to building for WinCE devices could be asked in
perlce-users@@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

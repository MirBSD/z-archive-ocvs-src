.SH NAME
zcmp, zdiff \- compare compressed files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zcmp
[ cmp_options ] file1
[ file2 ]
.br
.B zdiff
[ diff_options ] file1
[ file2 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Zcmp
and 
.I zdiff
are used to invoke the
.I cmp
or the
.I diff
program on compressed files.  All options specified are passed directly to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are
.I file1
and an uncompressed
.IR file1 ".gz."
If two files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to
.I cmp
or
.IR diff "."
The exit status from 
.I cmp
or
.I diff
is preserved.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
cmp(1), diff(1), zmore(1), zgrep(1), znew(1), zforce(1), gzip(1), gzexe(1)
.SH BUGS
Messages from the
.I cmp
or
.I diff
programs refer to temporary filenames instead of those specified.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.TH MERGE 1 \*(Dt GNU
.SH NAME
merge \- three-way file merge
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B merge
[
.I "options"
]
.I "file1 file2 file3"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B merge
incorporates all changes that lead from
.I file2
to
.I file3
into
.IR file1 .
The result ordinarily goes into
.IR file1 .
.B merge
is useful for combining separate changes to an original.  Suppose
.I file2
is the original, and both
.I file1
and
.I file3
are modifications of
.IR file2 .
Then
.B merge
combines both changes.
.PP
A conflict occurs if both
.I file1
and
.I file3
have changes in a common segment of lines.
If a conflict is found,
.B merge
normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict with
.B <<<<<<<
and
.B >>>>>>>
lines.
A typical conflict will look like this:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.BI <<<<<<< " file A"
.I "lines in file A"
.B "======="
.I "lines in file B"
.BI >>>>>>> " file B"
.RE
.fi
.LP
If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result and delete one of the
alternatives.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
Output conflicts using the
.B \-A
style of
.BR diff3 (1),
if supported by
.BR diff3 .
This merges all changes leading from
.I file2
to
.I file3
into
.IR file1 ,
and generates the most verbose output.
.TP
\f3\-E\fP, \f3\-e\fP
These options specify conflict styles that generate less information
than
.BR \-A .
See
.BR diff3 (1)
for details.
The default is
.BR \-E .
With
.BR \-e ,
.B merge
does not warn about conflicts.
.TP
.BI \-L " label"
This option may be given up to three times, and specifies labels
to be used in place of the corresponding file names in conflict reports.
That is,
.B "merge\ \-L\ x\ \-L\ y\ \-L\ z\ a\ b\ c"
generates output that looks like it came from files
.BR x ,
.B y
and
.B z
instead of from files
.BR a ,
.B b
and
.BR c .
.TP
.BI \-p
Send results to standard output instead of overwriting
.IR file1 .
.TP
.BI \-q
Quiet; do not warn about conflicts.
.TP
.BI \-V
Print \*r's version number.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 for no conflicts, 1 for some conflicts, 2 for trouble.

.SH BUGS
It normally does not make sense to merge binary files as if they were text, but
.B merge
tries to do it anyway.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

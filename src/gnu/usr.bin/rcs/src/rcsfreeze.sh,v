# rcsfreeze - assign a symbolic revision number to a configuration of RCS files

#       The idea is to run rcsfreeze each time a new version is checked
#       in. A unique symbolic revision number (C_[number], where number
#       is increased each time rcsfreeze is run) is then assigned to the most
#       recent revision of each RCS file of the main trunk.
#
#       If the command is invoked with an argument, then this
#       argument is used as the symbolic name to freeze a configuration.
#       The unique identifier is still generated
#       and is listed in the log file but it will not appear as
#       part of the symbolic revision name in the actual RCS file.
#
#       A log message is requested from the user which is saved for future
#       references.
#
#       The shell script works only on all RCS files at one time.
#       It is important that all changed files are checked in (there are
#       no precautions against any error in this respect).
#       file names:
#       {RCS/}.rcsfreeze.ver	version number
#       {RCS/}.rscfreeze.log	log messages, most recent first

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

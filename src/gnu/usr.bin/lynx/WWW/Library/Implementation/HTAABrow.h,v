@/*                          BROWSER SIDE ACCESS AUTHORIZATION MODULE

   This module is the browser side interface to Access Authorization (AA) package.  It
   contains code only for browser.

   Important to know about memory allocation:

   Routines in this module use dynamic allocation, but free automatically all the memory
   reserved by them.

   Therefore the caller never has to (and never should) free() any object returned by
   these functions.

   Therefore also all the strings returned by this package are only valid until the next
   call to the same function is made.  This approach is selected, because of the nature of
   access authorization: no string returned by the package needs to be valid longer than
   until the next call.

   This also makes it easy to plug the AA package in: you don't have to ponder whether to
   free()something here or is it done somewhere else (because it is always done somewhere
   else).

   The strings that the package needs to store are copied so the original strings given as
   parameters to AA functions may be freed or modified with no side effects.

   Also note:The AA package does not free() anything else than what it has itself
   allocated.

Routines for Browser Side Recording of AA Info

   Most of the browser-side AA is done by the following two functions (which are called
   from file HTTP.c so the browsers using libwww only need to be linked with the new
   library and not be changed at all):

      HTAA_composeAuth() composes the Authorization: line contents, if the AA package
      thinks that the given document is protected. Otherwise this function returns NULL.
      This function also calls the functions HTPrompt(),HTPromptPassword() and HTConfirm()
      to get the username, password and some confirmation from the user.

      HTAA_shouldRetryWithAuth() determines whether to retry the request with AA or with a
      new AA (in case username or password was misspelled).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

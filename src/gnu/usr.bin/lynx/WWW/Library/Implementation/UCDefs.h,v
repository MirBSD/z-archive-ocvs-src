@Lynx 2.8.5dev.17 Patchlevel d

This fixes, among many others, the following:
* correct some mismatches between INSTALLATION and "configure --help" (prompted
  by discussion with Stef Caunter) -TD
* amend check for refresh-URL to ensure it only prepends a link for text/html
  content type (report by Carlton Anderson).
* do not strip parameters from refresh-URL (report by Carlton Anderson gave an
  example of their use) -TD
* remove obsolete XMOSAIC_HACK defines -TD
* improve check for Unix-style shell given in $SHELL by limiting the check to
  the base-name (discussion with GV, DK) -TD
* modify increment_tagged_htline() to reallocate its HTLine parameter if the
  result would be larger than the allocation.  This can happen when a large
  textarea is adjusted (report by Thorsten Glaser)  -TD
* add ifdef'd logic to change HTLine to calloc() rather than memory pools,
  making it possible to use valgrind, etc., for debugging -LP
* add check for broken ProFTPD 1.2.5rc1, e.g., at ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub,
  and force a reconnection if an error 550 is detected when doing RETR.  This
  is ifdef'd with BROKEN_PROFTPD and checks version (reports by GV, DK) -TD
* modify file-upload to not print a warning message if the form-field is empty
  (Frank Heckenbach).
* add a few null-pointer checks to GridText.c (addresses symptoms reported by
  Frederic L W Meunier when nested-tables are toggled off) -TD
* modify LYTrimNewline() to trim carriage-returns as well as line-feeds, making
  it possible to share cookie files between platforms that have different
  line-terminations (report by Frederic L W Meunier) -TD
* rename EXP_PERSISTENT_COOKIES ifdef to USE_PERSISTENT_COOKIES -TD
* rename EXP_READPROGRESS ifdef to USE_READPROGRESS -TD
* rename SOURCE_CACHE ifdef to USE_SOURCE_CACHE -TD
* change a few configure script defaults to "enable":  source-cache, prettysrc
  and read-eta.  Also change default for read-eta configuration flag to "Show
  KB/Sec" (requests by LP, Frederic L W Meunier) -TD
* change configure script to compile-in file-upload by default, change its
  corresponding ifdef to USE_FILE_UPLOAD -TD
* revert table-layout changes from dev.15/dev.16 because of unresolved
  issues -TD
* add configure option --with-bzlib -TD
* implement support for bzip compression by internal calls to libbz2 -IZ
* if a document is in the cache (the rendering is in memory), on reload it
  should not be cleared from the cache until the connection to the server is
  opened; if the connection fails, the user will reuse the old version (request
  by IZ) -LP
* correct strings in LYOptions.c so ENABLE_LYNXRC works for bookmark_file
  and run_all_execution_links -DK
* fix pathname generated for "View temporary file" in LYDownload.c using new
  function LYAddPathToSave() (report by P.J.Walsh) -TD
* change code to match lynx.cfg description for FORCE_COOKIE_PROMPT and
  FORCE_SSL_PROMPT, making "prompt" rather than "default" the keyword to use
  when telling lynx to prompt (report by DK) -TD
* modify ifdef's to use mkdtemp() if it is available (prompted by MirBSD
  patch) -TD
* several fixes from Thorsten Glaser (MirBSD):
  + workaround for invoking shell scripts when executable permissions are
    discarded as a result from using CVS.
  + adjust buffer-size used in a readlink() call in case the result is too
    long to include trailing null.
  + change default ftp mode to passive.
  + if ftp connection fails, automatically retry, switching between passive
    and active modes.  Do this retry switching only when connecting to a
    different host.  A new variable ftp_local_passive distinguishes this
    from the user preference in ftp_passive.
  + improved certificate handling (case-insensitive domain-comparison, strip
    port-numbers from comparison).
  + fix a few typos & compiler-warnings.
* modify configure script to not use "head -1", which does not work for some
  platforms when POSIXLY_CORRECT (sic) is set -TD
* fix configure script check for term.h, which may be <ncursesw/term.h> -TD
* amend change in dev.15 to HTParse() to escape spaces, to exclude non-URL
  strings such as absolute filenames (report by Patrick Ash) -TD
* modify LYParseTagParam() (added in dev.13) to not stop on ';' (fixes a bug
  reported by LV which broke complicated refresh-URL containing "&amp;") -TD
* change default start page to lynx.isc.org, since lynx.browser.org is not
  maintained -TD

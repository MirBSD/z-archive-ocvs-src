@1 LYNX
2 Name
       lynx  - a general purpose distributed information browser for the World
       Wide Web

2 Synopsis
       lynx [options] [path or URL]

       use "lynx -help" to display a complete list of current options.

2 Description
       Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users  running
       cursor-addressable,   character-cell   display   devices  (e.g.,  vt100
       terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes,  or
       any other "curses-oriented" display).  It will display hypertext markup
       language (HTML) documents containing links to  files  residing  on  the
       local  system,  as  well  as  files  residing on remote systems running
       Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.  Current  versions  of  Lynx
       run on Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

       Lynx  can  be  used  to access information on the World Wide Web, or to
       build information systems intended primarily  for  local  access.   For
       example,  Lynx  has  been used to build several Campus Wide Information
       Systems (CWIS).  In  addition,  Lynx  can  be  used  to  build  systems
       isolated within a single LAN.

2 Options
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL specified at
       the command line.  For help with URLs, press "?"  or "H" while  running
       Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."

       If  more  than  one  local  file or remote URL is listed on the command
       line, Lynx will open only the last interactively.   All  of  the  names
       (local files and remote URLs) are added to the G)oto history.

       Lynx  uses  only  long option names. Option names can begin with double
       dash as well, underscores and dashes can be intermixed in option  names
       (in  the reference below options are with one dash before them and with
       underscores).

       -      If the argument is only `-', then Lynx expects  to  receive  the
              arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the potentially very
              long command line that can be associated with the  -get_data  or
              -post_data  arguments (see below).  It can also be used to avoid
              having sensitive information in the invoking command line (which
              would be visible to other processes on most systems), especially
              when the -auth or -pauth options are used.

       -accept_all_cookies
              accept all cookies.

       -anonymous
              apply   restrictions   for   anonymous   account,    see    also
              -restrictions.

       -assume_charset=MIMEname
              charset for documents that don't specify it.

       -assume_local_charset=MIMEname
              charset  assumed for local files, i.e., files which lynx creates
              such as internal pages for the options menu.

       -assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname
              use this instead of unrecognized charsets.

       -auth=ID:PASSWD
              set authorization ID and password  for  protected  documents  at
              startup.   Be  sure  to  protect any script files which use this
              switch.

       -base  prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html  outputs
              for -source dumps.

       -bibp=URL
              specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).

       -blink forces  high  intensity  background  colors  for  color mode, if
              available and supported by the terminal.  This  applies  to  the
              slang  library  (for  a  few terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX
              with ncurses.

       -book  use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or  command
              line  startfile  is  still  set for the Main screen command, and
              will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

       -buried_news
              toggles scanning of news articles  for  buried  references,  and
              converts  them  to  news  links.   Not recommended because email
              addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to  false
              news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.

       -cache=NUMBER
              set  the  NUMBER  of documents cached in memory.  The default is
              10.

       -case  enable case-sensitive string searching.

       -center
              Toggle center alignment in HTML TABLE.

       -cfg=FILENAME
              specifies a Lynx  configuration  file  other  than  the  default
              lynx.cfg.

       -child exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk.

       -cmd_log=FILENAME
              write   keystroke   commands  and  related  information  to  the
              specified file.

       -cmd_script=FILENAME
              read keystroke commands from the specified file.   You  can  use
              the  data  written  using the -cmd_log option.  Lynx will ignore
              other information which the command-logging may have written  to
              the  logfile.  Each line of the command script contains either a
              comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:

            exit causes  the  script  to  stop,  and  forces  Lynx   to   exit
                 immediately.

            key  the  character  value,  in  printable form.  Cursor and other
                 special  keys  are  given  as  names,  e.g.,  "Down   Arrow".
                 Printable  7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is, and hexadecimal
                 values represent other 8-bit codes.

            set  followed by a "name=value" allows one to override values  set
                 in the lynx.cfg file.

       -color forces  color  mode  on,  if  available.   Default color control
              sequences which work for many terminal types are assumed if  the
              terminal  capability  description does not specify how to handle
              color.  Lynx needs to be compiled with  the  slang  library  for
              this flag, it is equivalent to setting the COLORTERM environment
              variable.  (If color support is instead  provided  by  a  color-
              capable  curses  library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on
              the terminal description to  determine  whether  color  mode  is
              possible,  and this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)  A
              saved show_color=always setting  found  in  a  .lynxrc  file  at
              startup  has the same effect.  A saved show_color=never found in
              .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.

       -connect_timeout=N
              Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       -cookie_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to read cookies.  If none is  specified,
              the  default  value  is  ~/.lynx_cookies  for  most systems, but
              ~/cookies for MS-DOS.

       -cookie_save_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to store cookies.  If none is specified,
              the value given by -cookie_file is used.

       -cookies
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

       -core  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.  Turn this option off
              to ask Lynx to force a core dump if a fatal error occurs.

       -crawl with -traversal, output each page to a file.  with -dump, format
              output as with -traversal, but to stdout.

       -curses_pads
              toggles   the   use  of  curses  "pad"  feature  which  supports
              left/right scrolling of the display.

       -debug_partial
              separate incremental display stages with MessageSecs delay

       -delay add DebugSecs delay after each progress-message

       -display=DISPLAY
              set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.

       -display_charset=MIMEname
              set the charset for the terminal output.

       -dont_wrap_pre
              inhibit wrapping of text in <pre> when -dump'ing and -crawl'ing,
              mark wrapped lines in interactive session.

       -dump  dumps  the  formatted  output  of  the default document or those
              specified on  the  command  line  to  standard  output.   Unlike
              interactive mode, all documents are processed.  This can be used
              in the following way:

              lynx -dump http://www.subir.com/lynx.html

       -editor=EDITOR
              enable external editing, using the specified  EDITOR.  (vi,  ed,
              emacs, etc.)

       -emacskeys
              enable emacs-like key movement.

       -enable_scrollback
              toggles  compatibility  with  communication programs' scrollback
              keys (may be incompatible with some curses packages).

       -error_file=FILE
              define a file where Lynx will report HTTP access codes.

       -exec  enable local program execution (normally not configured).

       -fileversions
              include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.

       -find_leaks
              toggle memory leak-checking.  Normally this is not compiled-into
              your  executable,  but  when  it  is,  it  can be disabled for a
              session.

       -force_empty_hrefless_a
              force HREF-less `A' elements to be empty (close them as soon  as
              they are seen).

       -force_html
              forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.

       -force_secure
              toggles forcing of the secure flag for SSL cookies.

       -forms_options
              toggles whether the Options Menu is key-based or form-based.

       -from  toggles transmissions of From headers.

       -ftp   disable ftp access.

       -get_data
              properly  formatted  data  for a get form are read in from stdin
              and passed to the form.  Input is  terminated  by  a  line  that
              starts with `---'.

       -head  send a HEAD request for the mime headers.

       -help  print the Lynx command syntax usage message.

       -hiddenlinks=[option]
              control the display of hidden links.

              merge hidden links show up as bracketed numbers and are numbered
              together with other links in the sequence of their occurrence in
              the document.

              listonly  hidden  links  are  shown  only  on  L)ist screens and
              listings generated by -dump or from the P)rint menu, but  appear
              separately  at  the  end  of  those  lists.  This is the default
              behavior.

              ignore hidden links do not appear even in listings.

       -historical
              toggles use of `>' or `-->' as a terminator for comments.

       -homepage=URL
              set homepage separate from start page.

       -image_links
              toggles inclusion of links for all images.

       -index=URL
              set the default index file to the specified URL.

       -ismap toggles inclusion of  ISMAP  links  when  client-side  MAPs  are
              present.

       -justify
              do justification of text.

       -link=NUMBER
              starting count for lnk#.dat files produced by -crawl.

       -listonly
              for -dump, show only the list of links.

              disable URLs that point to remote hosts.

       -locexec
              enable  local  program  execution from local files only (if Lynx
              was compiled with local execution enabled).

       -lss=FILENAME
              specify  filename  containing  color-style   information.    The
              default is lynx.lss.

       -mime_header
              prints  the  MIME  header  of  a fetched document along with its

              URL or form ACTION.

       -nocolor
              force color mode off, overriding terminal capabilities  and  any
              -color flags, COLORTERM variable, and saved .lynxrc settings.

       -nolog disable mailing of error messages to document owners.

       -nonrestarting_sigwinch
              This  flag  is  not  available  on all systems, Lynx needs to be
              compiled with HAVE_SIGACTION defined.  If available,  this  flag
              may  cause Lynx to react more immediately to window changes when
              run within an xterm.

       -nonumbers
              disable   link-    and    field-numbering.     This    overrides

              to the new URL.

       -noreferer
              disable transmissions of Referer headers.

       -noreverse

              partial-display logic

       -pauth=ID:PASSWD
              set  authorization  ID and password for a protected proxy server
              at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files which use  this
              switch.

       -popup toggles  handling  of  single-choice  SELECT  options  via popup
              windows or as lists of radio buttons.

       -post_data
              properly formatted data for a post form are read in  from  stdin
              and  passed  to  the  form.   Input is terminated by a line that
              starts with `---'.

       -preparsed
              show HTML  source  preparsed  and  reformatted  when  used  with
              -source or in source view.

       -prettysrc
              show HTML source view with lexical elements and tags in color.

       -print enable print functions. (default)

       -pseudo_inlines
              toggles pseudo-ALTs for inline images with no ALT string.

       -raw   toggles  default  setting of 8-bit character translations or CJK
              mode for the startup character set.

       -realm restricts access to URLs in the starting realm.

       -reload
              flushes the cache on a proxy server  (only  the  first  document
              affected).

       -restrictions=[option][,option][,option]...
              allows a list of services to be disabled selectively. Dashes and
              underscores in option names can  be  intermixed.  The  following
              list is printed if no options are specified.

              all - restricts all options listed below.

              bookmark  - disallow changing the location of the bookmark file.

              bookmark_exec - disallow execution links via the bookmark  file.

              change_exec_perms  - disallow changing the eXecute permission on
              files (but still allow  it  for  directories)  when  local  file

              toggles forced resubmissions (no-cache)  of  forms  with  method
              POST  when  the  documents  they  returned  are  sought with the
              PREV_DOC command or from the History List.

       -rlogin
              disable recognition of rlogin commands.

       -scrollbar
              toggles showing scrollbar.

       -scrollbar_arrow
              toggles showing arrows at ends of the scrollbar.

       -selective
              require .www_browsable files to browse directories.

       -short_url
              show very long URLs in the status line with "..."  to  represent
              the portion which cannot be displayed.  The beginning and end of
              the URL are displayed, rather than suppressing the end.

       -show_cursor
              If enabled the cursor will not  be  hidden  in  the  right  hand
              corner  but  will  instead  be  positioned  at  the start of the
              currently selected link.  Show cursor is the default for systems
              without  FANCY_CURSES  capabilities.   The default configuration
              can be changed in userdefs.h  or  lynx.cfg.   The  command  line
              switch toggles the default.

       -show_rate
              If  enabled  the  transfer  rate  is  shown in bytes/second.  If
              disabled, no transfer  rate  is  shown.   Use  lynx.cfg  or  the
              options menu to select KB/second and/or ETA.

       -soft_dquotes
              toggles  emulation  of  the  old  Netscape  and Mosaic bug which
              treated `>' as a co-terminator for double-quotes and tags.

       -source
              works the same as  dump  but  outputs  HTML  source  instead  of
              formatted text.

       -stack_dump
              disable SIGINT cleanup handler

       -startfile_ok
              allow non-http startfile and homepage with -validate.

       -stdin read the startfile from standard input (UNIX only).

       -syslog=text
              information for syslog call.

       -syslog-urls
              log requested URLs with syslog.

       -tagsoup
              initialize parser, using Tag Soup DTD rather than SortaSGML.

       -telnet
              disable recognition of telnet commands.

       -term=TERM
              tell  Lynx what terminal type to assume it is talking to.  (This
              may be useful for remote  execution,  when,  for  example,  Lynx
              connects  to  a remote TCP/IP port that starts a script that, in
              turn, starts another Lynx process.)

       -timeout=N
              For win32, sets the network read-timeout, where N  is  given  in
              seconds.

       -tlog  toggles  between  using  a  Lynx  Trace Log and stderr for trace
              output from the session.

       -tna   turns on "Textfields Need Activation" mode.

       -trace turns on Lynx trace mode.  Destination of trace  output  depends
              on -tlog.

       -trace_mask=value
              turn  on  optional  traces, which may result in very large trace
              files.  Logically OR the values to combine options:
              1=SGML character parsing states
              2=color-style
              4=TRST (table layout)
              8=config (lynx.cfg and .lynxrc contents)
              16=binary string copy/append, used in form data construction.

       -traversal
              traverse all http links derived from startfile.  When used  with
              -crawl,  each link that begins with the same string as startfile
              is output to a file, intended for indexing.  See  CRAWL.announce
              for more information.

       trim_input_fields
              trim input text/textarea fields in forms.

       -underline_links
              toggles use of underline/bold attribute for links.

       -underscore
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       -use_mouse
              turn  on  mouse  support, if available.  Clicking the left mouse
              button on a link traverses it.  Clicking the right mouse  button
              pops  back.   Click  on the top line to scroll up.  Click on the
              bottom line to scroll down.  The first few positions in the  top
              and  bottom  line may invoke additional functions.  Lynx must be
              compiled with ncurses or slang  to  support  this  feature.   If
              ncurses  is  used,  clicking  the  middle mouse button pops up a
              simple menu.  Mouse clicks may only work reliably while Lynx  is
              idle waiting for input.

       -useragent=Name
              set alternate Lynx User-Agent header.

       -validate
              accept  only  http  URLs  (for  validation).   Complete security
              restrictions also are implemented.

       -verbose
              toggle [LINK], [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with  filenames  of
              these images.

       -version
              print version information.

       -vikeys
              enable vi-like key movement.

       -wdebug
              enable  Waterloo  tcp/ip packet debug (print to watt debugfile).
              This applies only  to  DOS  versions  compiled  with  WATTCP  or
              WATT-32.

       -width=NUMBER
              number of columns for formatting of dumps, default is 80.

       -with_backspaces
              emit backspaces in output if -dump'ing or -crawl'ing (like `man'
              does)

2 Commands
       o  Use Up arrow and Down arrow to scroll through hypertext links.

       o  Right arrow or Return will follow a highlighted hypertext link.

       o  Left Arrow will retreat from a link.

       o  Type "H" or "?" for  online  help  and  descriptions  of  key-stroke
          commands.

       o  Type  "K"  for  a  complete  list  of the current key-stroke command
          mappings.

2 Environment
       In addition to various "standard" environment variables such  as  HOME,
       PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY, TMPDIR, etc, Lynx utilizes several Lynx-specific
       environment variables, if they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data to  an  external
       program, or for other reasons.  These are listed separately below.

       See  also  the  sections  on  SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and NATIVE LANGUAGE
       SUPPORT, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all  types  of  platforms
       supported  by  Lynx, though most do.  Feedback on platform dependencies
       is solicited.

       Environment Variables Used By Lynx:

       COLORTERM           If set, color capability for the terminal is forced
                           on  at  startup time.  The actual value assigned to
                           the variable is ignored.   This  variable  is  only
                           meaningful  if  Lynx  was  built  using  the  slang
                           screen-handling library.

       LYNX_CFG            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           location  and name of the global configuration file
                           (normally,  lynx.cfg)  that  was  defined  by   the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE  constant  in  the  userdefs.h  file,
                           during installation.  See the userdefs.h  file  for
                           more information.

       LYNX_LOCALEDIR      If  set,  this  variable  overrides the compiled-in
                           location of the  locale  directory  which  contains
                           native language (NLS) message text.

       LYNX_LSS            This  variable,  if  set, specifies the location of
                           the  default  Lynx  character  style  sheet   file.
                           [Currently  only meaningful if Lynx was built using
                           experimental color style support.]

       LYNX_SAVE_SPACE     This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           path prefix for files saved to disk that is defined
                           in the lynx.cfg  SAVE_SPACE:  statement.   See  the
                           lynx.cfg file for more information.

       LYNX_TEMP_SPACE     This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           path prefix for temporary files  that  was  defined
                           during  installation, as well as any value that may
                           be assigned to the TMPDIR variable.

       MAIL                This variable specifies the default inbox Lynx will
                           check  for new mail, if such checking is enabled in
                           the lynx.cfg file.

       NEWS_ORGANIZATION   This variable, if set, provides the string used  in
                           the  Organization:  header of USENET news postings.
                           It will override the setting  of  the  ORGANIZATION
                           environment  variable,  if  it is also set (and, on
                           UNIX, the contents of an /etc/organization file, if
                           present).

       NNTPSERVER          If  set,  this  variable specifies the default NNTP
                           server that will be used for  USENET  news  reading
                           and posting with Lynx, via news: URL's.

       ORGANIZATION        This  variable, if set, provides the string used in
                           the Organization: header of USENET  news  postings.
                           On  UNIX,  it  will  override  the  contents  of an
                           /etc/organization file, if present.

       PROTOCOL_proxy      Lynx supports the use of proxy servers that can act
                           as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are
                           preferable  to  the  older  gateway  servers   (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY,  below).  Each protocol used by
                           Lynx, (http,  ftp,  gopher,  etc),  can  be  mapped
                           separately  by setting environment variables of the
                           form   PROTOCOL_proxy    (literally:    http_proxy,
                           ftp_proxy,       gopher_proxy,       etc),       to
                           "http://some.server.dom:port/".   See  Lynx   Users
                           Guide for additional details and examples.

       SSL_CERT_DIR        Set    to    the   directory   containing   trusted
                           certificates.

       SSL_CERT_FILE       Set to the full path and filename for your file  of
                           trusted certificates.

       WWW_access_GATEWAY  Lynx  still  supports  use of gateway servers, with
                           the  servers  specified  via   "WWW_access_GATEWAY"
                           variables  (where "access" is lower case and can be
                           "http", "ftp", "gopher" or  "wais"),  however  most
                           gateway  servers have been discontinued.  Note that
                           you do not include a terminal `/' for gateways, but
                           do   for   proxies   specified   by  PROTOCOL_proxy
                           environment variables.  See Lynx  Users  Guide  for
                           details.

       WWW_HOME            This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           startup  URL  specified  in   any   of   the   Lynx
                           configuration files.

       Environment Variables Set or Modified By Lynx:

       LYNX_PRINT_DATE     This  variable is set by the Lynx p(rint) function,
                           to  the  Date:  string  seen  in   the   document's
                           "Information  about"  page  (= cmd), if any.  It is
                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           Date" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD  This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to  the  Last  Mod:  string  seen in the document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           LastMod" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_TITLE    This  variable is set by the Lynx p(rint) function,
                           to the Linkname:  string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information  about"  page  (= cmd), if any.  It is
                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           Title" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_URL      This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to   the   URL:   string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           URL" under VMS.

       LYNX_TRACE          If set, causes Lynx to write a trace file as if the
                           -trace option were supplied.

       LYNX_TRACE_FILE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace
                           file,  which  is  either Lynx.trace or LY-TRACE.LOG
                           (the latter on the DOS platform).  The  trace  file
                           is in either case relative to the home directory.

       LYNX_VERSION        This  variable  is  always  set by Lynx, and may be
                           used by an external program to determine if it  was
                           invoked  by  Lynx.   See  also  the comments in the
                           distribution's sample mailcap file,  for  notes  on
                           usage in such a file.

       TERM                Normally,   this   variable  is  used  by  Lynx  to
                           determine the terminal type being  used  to  invoke
                           Lynx.  If, however, it is unset at startup time (or
                           has the value "unknown"), or if the -term  command-
                           line  option  is  used (see OPTIONS section above),
                           Lynx will set or  modify  its  value  to  the  user
                           specified  terminal  type  (for  the Lynx execution
                           environment).  Note: If set/modified by  Lynx,  the
                           values  of  the  LINES  and/or  COLUMNS environment
                           variables may also be changed.

2 Simulated Cgi Support
       If built with the cgi-links option enabled, Lynx allows access to a cgi
       script directly without the need for an http daemon.

       When  executing  such  "lynxcgi  scripts"  (if  enabled), the following
       variables may be set for simulating a CGI environment:

       CONTENT_LENGTH

       CONTENT_TYPE

       DOCUMENT_ROOT

       HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET

       HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE

       HTTP_USER_AGENT

       PATH_INFO

       PATH_TRANSLATED

       QUERY_STRING

       REMOTE_ADDR

       REMOTE_HOST

       REQUEST_METHOD

       SERVER_SOFTWARE

       Other environment variables are not inherited  by  the  script,  unless
       they   are   provided   via  a  LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT  statement  in  the
       configuration file.  See the lynx.cfg file, and  the  (draft)  CGI  1.1
       Specification <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt>
       for the definition and usage of these variables.

       The CGI Specification, and other associated  documentation,  should  be
       consulted for general information on CGI script programming.

2 Native Language Support
       If  configured  and  installed  with Native Language Support, Lynx will
       display status and other messages in your local language.  See the file
       ABOUT_NLS  in  the  source distribution, or at your local GNU site, for
       more information about internationalization.

       The following environment  variables  may  be  used  to  alter  default
       settings:

       LANG                This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           message language.  It is an ISO 639 two-letter code
                           identifying  the  language.  Language codes are NOT
                           the same as the country codes given in ISO 3166.

       LANGUAGE            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           message language.  This is a GNU extension that has
                           higher priority for  setting  the  message  catalog
                           than LANG or LC_ALL.

       LC_ALL              and

       LC_MESSAGES         These  variables,  if  set,  specify  the notion of
                           native language formatting style.  They are POSIXly
                           correct.

       LINGUAS             This  variable,  if  set  prior  to  configuration,
                           limits the installed languages to specific  values.
                           It  is  a space-separated list of two-letter codes.
                           Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.

       NLSPATH             This variable, if set, is used as the  path  prefix
                           for message catalogs.

       Note that man page availability and section numbering is somewhat platform
       dependent, and may vary from the above references.

       A section shown as (GNU), is intended to denote that the topic  may  be
       available via an info page, instead of a man page (i.e., try "info subject",
       rather than "man subject").

       A section shown as (?) denotes that documentation on the topic  exists,
       but  is  not part of an established documentation retrieval system (see
       the distribution files associated with the topic, or contact your  System
       Administrator for further information).

2 Acknowledgments
       Lynx  has  incorporated  code  from a variety of sources along the way.
       The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of  Comput-
       ing  Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPER-
       REZ in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson  of
       Think.com  and  served  as  the  model  for the early versions of Lynx.
       Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
       developed  at  the  University  of Minnesota, and the later versions of
       Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by  Tim  Berners-Lee
       and  the  WWW  community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
       ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
       since  the  departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the Uni-
       versity of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release of  v2.7.2,
       and  to  everyone  on the net who has contributed to Lynx's development
       either directly (through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirect-
       ly (through inspiration and development of other systems).

       use "lynx -help" to display a  complete  list  of  current
       options.

       Lynx  is  a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for
       users running cursor-addressable,  character-cell  display
       devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on
       Windows  95/NT  or  Macintoshes,  or  any  other  "curses-
       oriented"  display).   It  will  display  hypertext markup
       language  (HTML)  documents  containing  links  to   files
       residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
       remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,  and  NNTP
       servers.   Current  versions  of  Lynx  run  on Unix, VMS,
       Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

       Lynx can be used to access information on the  World  Wide
       Web,  or  to  build information systems intended primarily
       for local access.  For example,  Lynx  has  been  used  to
       build  several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
       addition, Lynx can  be  used  to  build  systems  isolated
       within a single LAN.
d28 20
a47 19
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL
       specified at the command line.  For help with URLs,  press
       "?"   or  "H"  while  running  Lynx.  Then follow the link
       titled, "Help on URLs."

       Lynx uses only long option names. Option names  can  begin
       with  double  dash  as well, underscores and dashes can be
       intermixed in option names (in the reference below options
       are with one dash before them and with underscores).

       -      If  the  argument is only `-', then Lynx expects to
              receive the arguments from stdin.  This is to allow
              for the potentially very long command line that can
              be associated  with  the  -get_data  or  -post_data
              arguments  (see  below).   It  can  also be used to
              avoid having sensitive information in the  invoking
              command  line  (which  would  be  visible  to other
              processes on most  systems),  especially  when  the
              -auth or -pauth options are used.

              This applies  to  the  slang  library  (for  a  few
              terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX with ncurses.

       -book  use  the  bookmark  page  as  the  startfile.   The
              default or command line startfile is still set  for
              the  Main  screen  command, and will be used if the
              bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

d111 28

              read keystroke commands from  the  specified  file.
              You  can  use  the  data written using the -cmd_log
              option.  Lynx will ignore other  information  which
              the   command-logging   may  have  written  to  the
              logfile.  Each line of the command script  contains
              either a comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:

            exit causes  the  script  to stop, and forces lynx to
                 exit immediately.

            key  the character value, in printable form.   Cursor
                 and other special keys are given as names, e.g.,
                 "Down Arrow".  Printable 7-bit ASCII  codes  are
                 given  as-is,  and  hexadecimal values represent
                 other 8-bit codes.

            set  followed  by  a  "name=value"  allows   one   to
                 override values set in the lynx.cfg file.

       -color forces  color mode on, if available.  Default color
              control sequences  which  work  for  many  terminal
              types   are  assumed  if  the  terminal  capability
              description does not specify how to  handle  color.
              Lynx  needs  to  be compiled with the slang library
              for this flag, it  is  equivalent  to  setting  the
              COLORTERM  environment variable.  (If color support
              is  instead  provided  by  a  color-capable  curses
              library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on the
              terminal description  to  determine  whether  color
              mode  is  possible, and this flag is not needed and
              thus  unavailable.)   A   saved   show_color=always
              setting  found in a .lynxrc file at startup has the
              same effect.  A  saved  show_color=never  found  in

       In  addition  to  various "standard" environment variables
       such as HOME,  PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY,  TMPDIR,  etc,  Lynx
       utilizes  several  Lynx-specific environment variables, if
       they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data  to
       an  external  program,  or  for  other reasons.  These are
       listed separately below.

       See also the sections on SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and  NATIVE
       LANGUAGE SUPPORT, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all types of
       platforms supported by Lynx, though most do.  Feedback  on
       platform dependencies is solicited.

       COLORTERM           If   set,  color  capability  for  the
                           terminal is forced on at startup time.
                           The   actual  value  assigned  to  the
                           variable is ignored.  This variable is
                           only  meaningful  if  Lynx  was  built
                           using   the   slang    screen-handling
                           library.

       LYNX_CFG            This  variable,  if set, will override
                           the default location and name  of  the
                           global  configuration  file (normally,
                           lynx.cfg)  that  was  defined  by  the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE    constant    in    the
                           userdefs.h file, during  installation.

                           information.

       LYNX_LOCALEDIR      If set, this  variable  overrides  the
                           compiled-in  location  of  the  locale
                           directory   which   contains    native
                           language (NLS) message text.

       LYNX_LSS            This  variable,  if set, specifies the
                           location of the default Lynx character
                           style  sheet  file.   [Currently  only

       LYNX_SAVE_SPACE     This  variable,  if set, will override
                           the  default  path  prefix  for  files
                           saved  to  disk that is defined in the
                           lynx.cfg SAVE_SPACE:  statement.   See
                           the    lynx.cfg    file    for   more
                           information.

       LYNX_TEMP_SPACE     This variable, if set,  will  override
                           the  default path prefix for temporary
                           files   that   was   defined    during
                           installation,  as  well  as  any value
                           that may be  assigned  to  the  TMPDIR
                           variable.

       MAIL                This  variable  specifies  the default
                           inbox Lynx will check for new mail, if
                           such   checking   is  enabled  in  the
                           lynx.cfg file.

       NEWS_ORGANIZATION   This variable, if  set,  provides  the
                           string   used   in  the  Organization:
                           header of USENET  news  postings.   It
                           will   override  the  setting  of  the
                           ORGANIZATION environment variable,  if
                           it  is  also  set  (and,  on UNIX, the
                           contents of an /etc/organization file,
                           if present).

       NNTPSERVER          If  set,  this  variable specifies the
                           default NNTP server that will be  used
                           for  USENET  news  reading and posting
                           with Lynx, via news: URL's.

       ORGANIZATION        This variable, if  set,  provides  the
                           string   used   in  the  Organization:
                           header of USENET  news  postings.   On
                           UNIX, it will override the contents of
                           an /etc/organization file, if present.

       PROTOCOL_proxy      Lynx supports the use of proxy servers
                           that can act as firewall gateways  and
                           caching  servers.  They are preferable
                           to  the  older  gateway  servers  (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY,    below).    Each
                           protocol used  by  Lynx,  (http,  ftp,
                           gopher, etc), can be mapped separately
                           by setting  environment  variables  of
                           the  form  PROTOCOL_proxy  (literally:
                           http_proxy,  ftp_proxy,  gopher_proxy,
                           etc),               to
                           "http://some.server.dom:port/".    See
                           Lynx   Users   Guide   for  additional

       WWW_access_GATEWAY  Lynx still  supports  use  of  gateway
                           servers,  with  the  servers specified
                           via   "WWW_access_GATEWAY"   variables
                           (where  "access" is lower case and can
                           be "http", "ftp", "gopher" or "wais"),
                           however most gateway servers have been
                           discontinued.  Note that  you  do  not
                           include  a  terminal `/' for gateways,
                           but  do  for  proxies   specified   by
                           PROTOCOL_proxy  environment variables.
                           See Lynx Users Guide for details.

       WWW_HOME            This variable, if set,  will  override
                           the  default  startup URL specified in
                           any of the Lynx configuration files.

       LYNX_PRINT_DATE     This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint)  function, to the Date: string
                           seen in  the  document's  "Information
                           about"  page  (=  cmd), if any.  It is
                           created  for  use   by   an   external
                           program,  as  defined  in  a  lynx.cfg
                           PRINTER: definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document,
                           the variable is set to a  null  string
                           under UNIX, or "No Date" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD  This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint) function,  to  the  Last  Mod:
                           string    seen   in   the   document's
                           "Information about" page (=  cmd),  if
                           any.   It  is  created  for  use by an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in  a
                           lynx.cfg      PRINTER:      definition
                           statement.   If  the  field  does  not
                           exist  for  the document, the variable
                           is set to a null string under UNIX, or
                           "No LastMod" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_TITLE    This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint)  function,  to  the  Linkname:
                           string    seen   in   the   document's
                           "Information about" page (=  cmd),  if
                           any.   It  is  created  for  use by an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in  a
                           lynx.cfg      PRINTER:      definition
                           statement.   If  the  field  does  not
                           exist  for  the document, the variable
                           is set to a null string under UNIX, or
                           "No Title" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_URL      This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint) function, to the  URL:  string
                           seen  in  the  document's "Information
                           about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created   for   use   by  an  external
                           program,  as  defined  in  a  lynx.cfg
                           PRINTER: definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document,
                           the  variable  is set to a null string
                           under UNIX, or "No URL" under VMS.

       LYNX_TRACE          If set, causes Lynx to write  a  trace
                           file  as  if  the  -trace  option were
                           supplied.

       LYNX_TRACE_FILE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name
                           of  the  trace  file,  which is either
                           Lynx.trace or LY-TRACE.LOG (the latter
                           on  the DOS platform).  The trace file
                           is in either case relative to the home
                           directory.

       LYNX_VERSION        This  variable  is always set by Lynx,
                           and may be used by an external program
                           to  determine  if  it  was  invoked by
                           Lynx.  See also the  comments  in  the
                           distribution's  sample  mailcap  file,
                           for notes on usage in such a file.

       TERM                Normally, this  variable  is  used  by
                           Lynx  to  determine  the terminal type
                           being  used  to  invoke   Lynx.    If,
                           however,  it  is unset at startup time
                           (or has the value  "unknown"),  or  if
                           the  -term command-line option is used
                           (see OPTIONS section above), Lynx will
                           set  or  modify  its value to the user
                           specified terminal type (for the  Lynx
                           execution   environment).    Note:  If
                           set/modified by Lynx,  the  values  of

       If built with the cgi-links option  enabled,  Lynx  allows
       access  to  a  cgi script directly without the need for an
       http daemon.

       When executing such "lynxcgi scripts"  (if  enabled),  the
       following  variables  may  be  set  for  simulating  a CGI
       environment:

       Other environment  variables  are  not  inherited  by  the
       script, unless they are provided via a LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT
       statement in the configuration  file.   See  the  lynx.cfg
       file,    and    the    (draft)   CGI   1.1   Specification

       If  configured and installed with Native Language Support,
       Lynx will display status and other messages in your  local
       language.    See   the   file   ABOUT_NLS  in  the  source
       distribution,  or  at  your  local  GNU  site,  for   more
       information about internationalization.

       The  following  environment variables may be used to alter
       default settings:

       LANG                This variable, if set,  will  override
                           the  default  message language.  It is
                           an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying
                           the  language.  Language codes are NOT
                           the same as the country codes given in
                           ISO 3166.

       LANGUAGE            This  variable,  if set, will override
                           the default message language.  This is
                           a   GNU   extension  that  has  higher
                           priority  for  setting   the   message
                           catalog than LANG or LC_ALL.
d882 8
a889 10
       LC_MESSAGES         These  variables,  if set, specify the
                           notion of native  language  formatting
                           style.  They are POSIXly correct.

       LINGUAS             This   variable,   if   set  prior  to
                           configuration,  limits  the  installed
                           languages to specific values.  It is a
                           space-separated  list  of   two-letter
                           codes.  Currently, it is hard-coded to

       NLSPATH             This variable, if set, is used as  the

       references.

       A section shown as (GNU), is intended to denote  that  the
       topic  may be available via an info page, instead of a man
       page (i.e., try "info  subject",  rather  than  "man  subject").

       A  section  shown as (?) denotes that documentation on the
       topic exists, but is not part of an established documentation
       retrieval system (see the distribution files associated
       with the topic, or contact your System  Administrator
       for further information).

       Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along
       the way.  The earliest versions of Lynx included code from
       Earl  Fogel  of  Computing  Services  at the University of
       Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ in the  Unix  envi-
       ronment.    HYPERREZ  was  developed  by  Niel  Larson  of
       Think.com and served as the model for the  early  versions
       of  Lynx.  Those versions also incorporated libraries from
       the Unix Gopher clients developed  at  the  University  of
       Minnesota,  and the later versions of Lynx rely on the WWW
       client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee  and  the
       WWW  community.   Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides
       who ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or  organized  most
       of  its  development  since the departures of Lou Montulli
       and Garrett Blythe from the University of  Kansas  in  the
       summer  of  1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and to ev-
       eryone on the net who has contributed to  Lynx's  develop-
       ment either directly (through patches, comments or bug re-
       ports) or indirectly (through inspiration and  development
       of other systems).

 NAME
 lynx - a general purpose distributed information browser for the World
 Wide Web
d6 2
a7 2
2 SYNOPSIS
     Lynx [options] [path or URL]
d9 2
a10 1
     use "lynx -help" to display a complete list of current options.
d12 11
a22 9
2 DESCRIPTION
 Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
 cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100 terminals,
 vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other "curses-oriented"
 display). It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents con-
 taining links to files residing on the local system, as well as files
 residing on remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP
 servers.  Current versions of Lynx run on Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT,
 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.
d24 6
a29 4
 Lynx can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or to build
 information systems intended primarily for local access.  For example, Lynx
 has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
 addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.
d31 5
a35 4
2 OPTIONS
 At start up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL specified at
 the command line.  For help with URLs, press "?" or "h" while running
 Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."
d37 4
a40 6
  -
       If the argument is only '-', then Lynx expects to receive
       arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the potentially
       very long command line that can be associated with the
       -get_data or -post_data arguments (see below).  Encase it
       in double-quotes ("-").
d42 9
a50 2
  -accept_all_cookies
       accept all cookies.
d52 2
a53 2
  -anonymous
       used to specify the anonymous account.
d55 3
a57 2
  -assume_charset=MIMEname
       charset for documents that don't specify it.
d59 2
a60 2
  -assume_local_charset=MIMEname
       charset assumed for local files.
d62 2
a63 2
  -assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname
       use this instead of unrecognized charsets.
d65 2
a66 4
  -auth=ID:PASSWD
       set authorization ID and password for protected documents
       at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files which use
       this switch.
d68 4
a71 3
  -base
       prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html
       outputs for -source dumps.
d73 2
a74 4
  -blink
       forces high intensity bg colors for color mode, if available
       and supported by the terminal.
       Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.
d76 3
a78 4
  -book
       use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
       line startfile is still set for the Main screen command, and will
       be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
d80 4
a83 5
  -buried_news
       toggles scanning of news articles for buried references, and
       converts them to news links.  Not recommended because email
       addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to
       false news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.
d85 4
a88 2
  -cache=NUMBER
       set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.  The default is 10.
d90 6
a95 2
  -case
       enable case-sensitive string searching.
d97 3
a99 2
  -cfg=FILENAME
       specifies a Lynx configuration file other than the default lynx.cfg.
d101 1
a101 2
  -child
       exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk.
d103 2
a104 8
  -color
       forces color mode on, if available.  Default color control sequences
       which work for many terminal types are assumed if the terminal
       capability description does not specify how to handle color.
       Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.
       A saved show_color=always setting found in a .lynxrc file at
       startup has the same effect.  A saved show_color=always found
       in .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
d106 3
a108 2
  -cookies
       toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

d128 5
a132 5
  -dump
       dumps the formatted output of the default document or one specified
       on the command line to standard out.  This can be used in the
       following way:
           lynx -dump http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html
d134 2

2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
 Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way.
 The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Computing
 Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ
 in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of
 Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx.
 Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
 developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of
 Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
 and the WWW community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
 ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
 since the departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the

2 Description
       Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users  running
       cursor-addressable,   character-cell   display   devices  (e.g.,  vt100
       terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes,  or
       any other "curses-oriented" display).  It will display hypertext markup
       language (HTML) documents containing links to  files  residing  on  the
       local  system,  as  well  as  files  residing on remote systems running
       Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.  Current  versions  of  Lynx
       run on Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.
d21 4
a24 5
       Lynx  can  be  used  to access information on the World Wide Web, or to
       build information systems intended primarily  for  local  access.   For
       example,  Lynx  has  been used to build several Campus Wide Information
       Systems (CWIS).  In  addition,  Lynx  can  be  used  to  build  systems
       isolated within a single LAN.
d26 4

2 Options
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL specified at
       the command line.  For help with URLs, press "?"  or "H" while  running
       Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."
d31 6
a36 3
       If  more  than  one  local  file or remote URL is listed on the command
       line, Lynx will open only the last interactively.   All  of  the  names
       (local files and remote URLs) are added to the G)oto history.
d38 2
a39 4
       Lynx  uses  only  long option names. Option names can begin with double
       dash as well, underscores and dashes can be intermixed in option  names
       (in  the reference below options are with one dash before them and with
       underscores).
d41 2
a42 7
       -      If the argument is only `-', then Lynx expects  to  receive  the
              arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the potentially very
              long command line that can be associated with the  -get_data  or
              -post_data  arguments (see below).  It can also be used to avoid
              having sensitive information in the invoking command line (which
              would be visible to other processes on most systems), especially
              when the -auth or -pauth options are used.
d44 2
a45 2
       -accept_all_cookies
              accept all cookies.
d47 2
a48 3
       -anonymous
              apply   restrictions   for   anonymous   account,    see    also
              -restrictions.
d50 2
a51 2
       -assume_charset=MIMEname
              charset for documents that don't specify it.
d53 4
a56 3
       -assume_local_charset=MIMEname
              charset  assumed for local files, i.e., files which lynx creates
              such as internal pages for the options menu.
d58 3
a60 2
       -assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname
              use this instead of unrecognized charsets.
d62 4
a65 4
       -auth=ID:PASSWD
              set authorization ID and password  for  protected  documents  at
              startup.   Be  sure  to  protect any script files which use this
              switch.
d67 4
a70 2
       -base  prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html  outputs
              for -source dumps.
d72 5
a76 2
       -bibp=URL
              specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).
d78 2
a79 4
       -blink forces  high  intensity  background  colors  for  color mode, if
              available and supported by the terminal.  This  applies  to  the
              slang  library  (for  a  few terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX
              with ncurses.
d81 2
a82 3
       -book  use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or  command
              line  startfile  is  still  set for the Main screen command, and
              will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
d84 2
a85 5
       -buried_news
              toggles scanning of news articles  for  buried  references,  and
              converts  them  to  news  links.   Not recommended because email
              addresses enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to  false
              news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.
d87 2
a88 3
       -cache=NUMBER
              set  the  NUMBER  of documents cached in memory.  The default is
              10.
d90 8
a97 1
       -case  enable case-sensitive string searching.
d99 2
a100 2
       -center
              Toggle center alignment in HTML TABLE.
d102 2
a103 3
       -cfg=FILENAME
              specifies a Lynx  configuration  file  other  than  the  default
              lynx.cfg.
d105 3
a107 1
       -child exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk.
d109 2
a110 3
       -cmd_log=FILENAME
              write   keystroke   commands  and  related  information  to  the
              specified file.
d112 2
a113 6
       -cmd_script=FILENAME
              read keystroke commands from the specified file.   You  can  use
              the  data  written  using the -cmd_log option.  Lynx will ignore
              other information which the command-logging may have written  to
              the  logfile.  Each line of the command script contains either a
              comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:
d115 5
a119 2
            exit causes  the  script  to  stop,  and  forces  Lynx   to   exit
                 immediately.
d121 2
a122 4
            key  the  character  value,  in  printable form.  Cursor and other
                 special  keys  are  given  as  names,  e.g.,  "Down   Arrow".
                 Printable  7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is, and hexadecimal
                 values represent other 8-bit codes.
d124 2
a125 2
            set  followed by a "name=value" allows one to override values  set
                 in the lynx.cfg file.
d127 3
a129 12
       -color forces  color  mode  on,  if  available.   Default color control
              sequences which work for many terminal types are assumed if  the
              terminal  capability  description does not specify how to handle
              color.  Lynx needs to be compiled with  the  slang  library  for
              this flag, it is equivalent to setting the COLORTERM environment
              variable.  (If color support is instead  provided  by  a  color-
              capable  curses  library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on
              the terminal description to  determine  whether  color  mode  is
              possible,  and this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)  A
              saved show_color=always setting  found  in  a  .lynxrc  file  at
              startup  has the same effect.  A saved show_color=never found in
              .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
d131 2
a132 2
       -connect_timeout=N
              Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.
d134 2
a135 4
       -cookie_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to read cookies.  If none is  specified,
              the  default  value  is  ~/.lynx_cookies  for  most systems, but
              ~/cookies for MS-DOS.
d137 2
a138 3
       -cookie_save_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to store cookies.  If none is specified,
              the value given by -cookie_file is used.
d140 2
a141 2
       -cookies
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.
d143 2
a144 2
       -core  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.  Turn this option off
              to ask Lynx to force a core dump if a fatal error occurs.
d146 2
a147 2
       -crawl with -traversal, output each page to a file.  with -dump, format
              output as with -traversal, but to stdout.
d149 2
a150 3
       -curses_pads
              toggles   the   use  of  curses  "pad"  feature  which  supports
              left/right scrolling of the display.

              mark wrapped lines in interactive session.
d167 3
a169 4
       -dump  dumps  the  formatted  output  of  the default document or those
              specified on  the  command  line  to  standard  output.   Unlike
              interactive mode, all documents are processed.  This can be used
              in the following way:

       -short_url
              show very long URLs in the status line with "..."  to  represent
              the portion which cannot be displayed.  The beginning and end of
              the URL are displayed, rather than suppressing the end.

       -show_cursor
              If enabled the cursor will not  be  hidden  in  the  right  hand
              corner  but  will  instead  be  positioned  at  the start of the
              currently selected link.  Show cursor is the default for systems
              without  FANCY_CURSES  capabilities.   The default configuration
              can be changed in userdefs.h  or  lynx.cfg.   The  command  line
              switch toggles the default.

       -show_rate
              If  enabled  the  transfer  rate  is  shown in bytes/second.  If
              disabled, no transfer  rate  is  shown.   Use  lynx.cfg  or  the
              options menu to select KB/second and/or ETA.

       -soft_dquotes
              toggles  emulation  of  the  old  Netscape  and Mosaic bug which
              treated `>' as a co-terminator for double-quotes and tags.

       -source
              works the same as  dump  but  outputs  HTML  source  instead  of
              formatted text.

       -stack_dump
              disable SIGINT cleanup handler

       -startfile_ok

              initialize parser, using Tag Soup DTD rather than SortaSGML.

       -telnet
              disable recognition of telnet commands.

       -term=TERM
              tell  Lynx what terminal type to assume it is talking to.  (This
              may be useful for remote  execution,  when,  for  example,  Lynx
              connects  to  a remote TCP/IP port that starts a script that, in
              turn, starts another Lynx process.)

       -timeout=N
              For win32, sets the network read-timeout, where N  is  given  in
              seconds.

       -tlog  toggles  between  using  a  Lynx  Trace Log and stderr for trace
              output from the session.

       -tna   turns on "Textfields Need Activation" mode.

       -trace turns on Lynx trace mode.  Destination of trace  output  depends
              on -tlog.

       -trace_mask=value
              turn  on  optional  traces, which may result in very large trace
              files.  Logically OR the values to combine options:
              1=SGML character parsing states
              2=color-style
              4=TRST (table layout)
              8=config (lynx.cfg and .lynxrc contents)
              16=binary string copy/append, used in form data construction.

       -traversal
              traverse all http links derived from startfile.  When used  with
              -crawl,  each link that begins with the same string as startfile
              is output to a file, intended for indexing.  See  CRAWL.announce
              for more information.

       trim_input_fields
              trim input text/textarea fields in forms.

       -underline_links
              toggles use of underline/bold attribute for links.

       -underscore
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       -use_mouse
              turn  on  mouse  support, if available.  Clicking the left mouse
              button on a link traverses it.  Clicking the right mouse  button
              pops  back.   Click  on the top line to scroll up.  Click on the
              bottom line to scroll down.  The first few positions in the  top
              and  bottom  line may invoke additional functions.  Lynx must be
              compiled with ncurses or slang  to  support  this  feature.   If
              ncurses  is  used,  clicking  the  middle mouse button pops up a
              simple menu.  Mouse clicks may only work reliably while Lynx  is
              idle waiting for input.

       -useragent=Name
              set alternate Lynx User-Agent header.

       -validate
              accept  only  http  URLs  (for  validation).   Complete security
              restrictions also are implemented.

       -verbose
              toggle [LINK], [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with  filenames  of
              these images.

       -version
              print version information.

       -vikeys
              enable vi-like key movement.

       -wdebug
              enable  Waterloo  tcp/ip packet debug (print to watt debugfile).
              This applies only  to  DOS  versions  compiled  with  WATTCP  or
              WATT-32.

       -width=NUMBER
              number of columns for formatting of dumps, default is 80.

       -with_backspaces
              emit backspaces in output if -dump'ing or -crawl'ing (like `man'
              does)

2 Commands
       o  Use Up arrow and Down arrow to scroll through hypertext links.

       o  Right arrow or Return will follow a highlighted hypertext link.

       o  Left Arrow will retreat from a link.

       o  Type "H" or "?" for  online  help  and  descriptions  of  key-stroke
          commands.

       o  Type  "K"  for  a  complete  list  of the current key-stroke command
          mappings.

2 Environment
       In addition to various "standard" environment variables such  as  HOME,
       PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY, TMPDIR, etc, Lynx utilizes several Lynx-specific
       environment variables, if they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data to  an  external
       program, or for other reasons.  These are listed separately below.

       See  also  the  sections  on  SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and NATIVE LANGUAGE
       SUPPORT, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all  types  of  platforms
       supported  by  Lynx, though most do.  Feedback on platform dependencies
       is solicited.

       COLORTERM           If set, color capability for the terminal is forced
                           on  at  startup time.  The actual value assigned to
                           the variable is ignored.   This  variable  is  only
                           meaningful  if  Lynx  was  built  using  the  slang
                           screen-handling library.

       LYNX_CFG            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           location  and name of the global configuration file
                           (normally,  lynx.cfg)  that  was  defined  by   the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE  constant  in  the  userdefs.h  file,
                           during installation.  See the userdefs.h  file  for
                           more information.

       LYNX_LOCALEDIR      If  set,  this  variable  overrides the compiled-in
                           location of the  locale  directory  which  contains
                           native language (NLS) message text.

       LYNX_LSS            This  variable,  if  set, specifies the location of
                           the  default  Lynx  character  style  sheet   file.

       LYNX_SAVE_SPACE     This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           path prefix for files saved to disk that is defined
                           in the lynx.cfg  SAVE_SPACE:  statement.   See  the
                           lynx.cfg file for more information.

       LYNX_TEMP_SPACE     This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           path prefix for temporary files  that  was  defined
                           during  installation, as well as any value that may

       MAIL                This variable specifies the default inbox Lynx will
                           check  for new mail, if such checking is enabled in
                           the lynx.cfg file.

       NEWS_ORGANIZATION   This variable, if set, provides the string used  in
                           the  Organization:  header of USENET news postings.
                           It will override the setting  of  the  ORGANIZATION
                           environment  variable,  if  it is also set (and, on
                           UNIX, the contents of an /etc/organization file, if

       NNTPSERVER          If  set,  this  variable specifies the default NNTP
                           server that will be used for  USENET  news  reading
                           and posting with Lynx, via news: URL's.

       ORGANIZATION        This  variable, if set, provides the string used in
                           the Organization: header of USENET  news  postings.
                           On  UNIX,  it  will  override  the  contents  of an
                           /etc/organization file, if present.

       PROTOCOL_proxy      Lynx supports the use of proxy servers that can act
                           as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are
                           preferable  to  the  older  gateway  servers   (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY,  below).  Each protocol used by
                           Lynx, (http,  ftp,  gopher,  etc),  can  be  mapped
                           separately  by setting environment variables of the
                           form   PROTOCOL_proxy    (literally:    http_proxy,
                           ftp_proxy,       gopher_proxy,       etc),       to
                           "http://some.server.dom:port/".   See  Lynx   Users
                           Guide for additional details and examples.

       SSL_CERT_DIR        Set    to    the   directory   containing   trusted
                           certificates.

       SSL_CERT_FILE       Set to the full path and filename for your file  of
                           trusted certificates.

       WWW_access_GATEWAY  Lynx  still  supports  use of gateway servers, with
                           the  servers  specified  via   "WWW_access_GATEWAY"
                           variables  (where "access" is lower case and can be
                           "http", "ftp", "gopher" or  "wais"),  however  most
                           gateway  servers have been discontinued.  Note that
                           you do not include a terminal `/' for gateways, but
                           do   for   proxies   specified   by  PROTOCOL_proxy
                           environment variables.  See Lynx  Users  Guide  for
                           details.

       WWW_HOME            This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           startup  URL  specified  in   any   of   the   Lynx
                           configuration files.

       LYNX_PRINT_DATE     This  variable is set by the Lynx p(rint) function,
                           to  the  Date:  string  seen  in   the   document's
                           "Information  about"  page  (= cmd), if any.  It is
                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           Date" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD  This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to  the  Last  Mod:  string  seen in the document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           LastMod" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_TITLE    This  variable is set by the Lynx p(rint) function,
                           to the Linkname:  string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information  about"  page  (= cmd), if any.  It is
                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           Title" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_URL      This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to   the   URL:   string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           URL" under VMS.

       LYNX_TRACE          If set, causes Lynx to write a trace file as if the
                           -trace option were supplied.

       LYNX_TRACE_FILE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace
                           file,  which  is  either Lynx.trace or LY-TRACE.LOG
                           (the latter on the DOS platform).  The  trace  file
                           is in either case relative to the home directory.

       LYNX_VERSION        This  variable  is  always  set by Lynx, and may be
                           used by an external program to determine if it  was
                           invoked  by  Lynx.   See  also  the comments in the
                           distribution's sample mailcap file,  for  notes  on
                           usage in such a file.

       TERM                Normally,   this   variable  is  used  by  Lynx  to
                           determine the terminal type being  used  to  invoke
                           Lynx.  If, however, it is unset at startup time (or
                           has the value "unknown"), or if the -term  command-
                           line  option  is  used (see OPTIONS section above),
                           Lynx will set or  modify  its  value  to  the  user
                           specified  terminal  type  (for  the Lynx execution
                           environment).  Note: If set/modified by  Lynx,  the
                           values  of  the  LINES  and/or  COLUMNS environment

2 Simulated Cgi Support
       If built with the cgi-links option enabled, Lynx allows access to a cgi
       script directly without the need for an http daemon.

       When  executing  such  "lynxcgi  scripts"  (if  enabled), the following
       variables may be set for simulating a CGI environment:
d695 5
a699 4
       Other environment variables are not inherited  by  the  script,  unless
       they   are   provided   via  a  LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT  statement  in  the
       configuration file.  See the lynx.cfg file, and  the  (draft)  CGI  1.1
       Specification <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt>
d702 25
a726 20
       The CGI Specification, and other associated  documentation,  should  be
       consulted for general information on CGI script programming.

2 Native Language Support
       If  configured  and  installed  with Native Language Support, Lynx will
       display status and other messages in your local language.  See the file
       ABOUT_NLS  in  the  source distribution, or at your local GNU site, for
       more information about internationalization.

       The following environment  variables  may  be  used  to  alter  default
       settings:

       LANG                This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           message language.  It is an ISO 639 two-letter code
                           identifying  the  language.  Language codes are NOT
                           the same as the country codes given in ISO 3166.

       LANGUAGE            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           message language.  This is a GNU extension that has
                           higher priority for  setting  the  message  catalog
d731 75
a805 70
       LC_MESSAGES         These  variables,  if  set,  specify  the notion of
                           native language formatting style.  They are POSIXly
                           correct.

       LINGUAS             This  variable,  if  set  prior  to  configuration,
                           limits the installed languages to specific  values.
                           It  is  a space-separated list of two-letter codes.
                           Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.

       NLSPATH             This variable, if set, is used as the  path  prefix
                           for message catalogs.

       Note that man page availability and section numbering is somewhat platform
       dependent, and may vary from the above references.

       A section shown as (GNU), is intended to denote that the topic  may  be
       available via an info page, instead of a man page (i.e., try "info subject",
       rather than "man subject").

       A section shown as (?) denotes that documentation on the topic  exists,
       but  is  not part of an established documentation retrieval system (see
       the distribution files associated with the topic, or contact your  System
       Administrator for further information).

2 Acknowledgments
       Lynx  has  incorporated  code  from a variety of sources along the way.
       The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of  Comput-
       ing  Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPER-
       REZ in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson  of
       Think.com  and  served  as  the  model  for the early versions of Lynx.
       Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
       developed  at  the  University  of Minnesota, and the later versions of
       Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by  Tim  Berners-Lee
       and  the  WWW  community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
       ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
       since  the  departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the Uni-
       versity of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release of  v2.7.2,
       and  to  everyone  on the net who has contributed to Lynx's development
       either directly (through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirect-
       ly (through inspiration and development of other systems).

2 Description
       Lynx  is  a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for
       users running cursor-addressable,  character-cell  display
       devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on
       Windows  95/NT  or  Macintoshes,  or  any  other  "curses-
       oriented"  display).   It  will  display  hypertext markup
       language  (HTML)  documents  containing  links  to   files
       residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
       remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,  and  NNTP
       servers.   Current  versions  of  Lynx  run  on Unix, VMS,
       Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

       Lynx can be used to access information on the  World  Wide
       Web,  or  to  build information systems intended primarily
       for local access.  For example,  Lynx  has  been  used  to
       build  several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
       addition, Lynx can  be  used  to  build  systems  isolated
       within a single LAN.

2 Options
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL
       specified at the command line.  For help with URLs,  press
       "?"   or  "H"  while  running  Lynx.  Then follow the link
       titled, "Help on URLs."
d31 6
a36 4
       Lynx uses only long option names. Option names  can  begin
       with  double  dash  as well, underscores and dashes can be
       intermixed in option names (in the reference below options
       are with one dash before them and with underscores).
d38 2
a39 9
       -      If  the  argument is only `-', then Lynx expects to
              receive the arguments from stdin.  This is to allow
              for the potentially very long command line that can
              be associated  with  the  -get_data  or  -post_data
              arguments  (see  below).   It  can  also be used to
              avoid having sensitive information in the  invoking
              command  line  (which  would  be  visible  to other
              processes on most  systems),  especially  when  the
              -auth or -pauth options are used.

              set authorization ID  and  password  for  protected
              documents  at  startup.   Be  sure  to  protect any
              script files which use this switch.

       -base  prepend a request  URL  comment  and  BASE  tag  to
              text/html outputs for -source dumps.

       -bibp=URL
              specify    a    local    bibp    server    (default
              http://bibhost/).
d72 5

       -blink forces high intensity background colors  for  color
              mode,  if  available and supported by the terminal.
              This applies  to  the  slang  library  (for  a  few
              terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX with ncurses.

       -book  use  the  bookmark  page  as  the  startfile.   The
              default or command line startfile is still set  for
              the  Main  screen  command, and will be used if the
              bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
d81 2
a82 6
       -buried_news
              toggles  scanning  of  news  articles  for   buried
              references,  and  converts them to news links.  Not
              recommended because  email  addresses  enclosed  in
              angle  brackets  will  be  converted  to false news
              links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.

a85 3
       -cache=NUMBER
              set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.   The
              default is 10.

       -cmd_log=FILENAME
              write keystroke commands and related information to
              the specified file.
d109 2
a110 7
       -cmd_script=FILENAME
              read keystroke commands from  the  specified  file.
              You  can  use  the  data written using the -cmd_log
              option.  Lynx will ignore other  information  which
              the   command-logging   may  have  written  to  the
              logfile.  Each line of the command script  contains
              either a comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:
d112 2

            exit causes  the  script  to stop, and forces lynx to
                 exit immediately.

            key  the character value, in printable form.   Cursor
                 and other special keys are given as names, e.g.,
                 "Down Arrow".  Printable 7-bit ASCII  codes  are
                 given  as-is,  and  hexadecimal values represent
                 other 8-bit codes.
d121 2
a122 2
            set  followed  by  a  "name=value"  allows   one   to
                 override values set in the lynx.cfg file.
d124 2
a125 15
       -color forces  color mode on, if available.  Default color
              control sequences  which  work  for  many  terminal
              types   are  assumed  if  the  terminal  capability
              description does not specify how to  handle  color.
              Lynx  needs  to  be compiled with the slang library
              for this flag, it  is  equivalent  to  setting  the
              COLORTERM  environment variable.  (If color support
              is  instead  provided  by  a  color-capable  curses
              library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on the
              terminal description  to  determine  whether  color
              mode  is  possible, and this flag is not needed and
              thus  unavailable.)   A   saved   show_color=always
              setting  found in a .lynxrc file at startup has the
              same effect.  A  saved  show_color=never  found  in
              .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
d127 3
a129 3
       -connect_timeout=N
              Sets  the  connection  timeout, where N is given in
              seconds.
d131 2
a132 4
       -cookie_file=FILENAME
              specifies  a  file to use to read cookies.  If none
              is specified, the default value is  ~/.lynx_cookies
              for most systems, but ~/cookies for MS-DOS.
d134 2
a135 4
       -cookie_save_file=FILENAME
              specifies  a file to use to store cookies.  If none
              is specified, the value given  by  -cookie_file  is
              used.
d137 2
a138 2
       -cookies
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.
d140 2
a141 1
       -core  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.
d143 2
a144 3
       -crawl with  -traversal, output each page to a file.  with
              -dump, format output as  with  -traversal,  but  to
              stdout.
d146 2
a147 3
       -curses_pads
              toggles  the  use  of  curses  "pad"  feature which
              supports left/right scrolling of the display.
d149 2
a150 3
       -debug_partial

              double-quotes and tags.

       -source
              works the same as  dump  but  outputs  HTML  source
              instead of formatted text.

       -stack_dump
              disable SIGINT cleanup handler

       -startfile_ok
              allow   non-http   startfile   and   homepage  with
              -validate.

       -stdin read the startfile from standard input (UNIX only).

       -syslog=text
              information for syslog call.

       -tagsoup
              initialize  parser,  using Tag Soup DTD rather than
              SortaSGML.

       -telnet
              disable recognition of telnet commands.

       -term=TERM
              tell Lynx  what  terminal  type  to  assume  it  is
              talking   to.   (This  may  be  useful  for  remote
              execution, when, for example, Lynx  connects  to  a
              remote  TCP/IP  port  that starts a script that, in
              turn, starts another Lynx process.)

       -timeout=N
              For win32, sets the network read-timeout,  where  N
              is given in seconds.

       -tlog  toggles  between  using a Lynx Trace Log and stderr
              for trace output from the session.

       -tna   turns on "Textfields Need Activation" mode.

       -trace turns on Lynx trace  mode.   Destination  of  trace
              output depends on -tlog.

       -trace_mask=value
              turn  on  optional traces, which may result in very
              large trace files.   Logically  OR  the  values  to
              combine options:
              1=SGML character parsing states
              2=color-style
              4=TRST (table layout)
              8=config (lynx.cfg and .lynxrc contents)
              16=binary  string  copy/append,  used  in form data
              construction.

       -traversal
              traverse all http  links  derived  from  startfile.
              When  used  with -crawl, each link that begins with
              the same string as startfile is output to  a  file,
              intended for indexing.  See CRAWL.announce for more
              information.

       trim_input_fields
              trim input text/textarea fields in forms.

       -underscore
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       -use_mouse
              turn on mouse support, if available.  Clicking  the
              left mouse button on a link traverses it.  Clicking
              the right mouse button pops back.  Click on the top
              line  to  scroll  up.   Click on the bottom line to
              scroll down.  The first few positions  in  the  top
              and  bottom  line  may invoke additional functions.
              Lynx must be compiled  with  ncurses  or  slang  to
              support this feature.  If ncurses is used, clicking
              the middle mouse button  pops  up  a  simple  menu.
              Mouse  clicks  may only work reliably while Lynx is
              idle waiting for input.

       -useragent=Name
              set alternate Lynx User-Agent header.

       -validate
              accept only http URLs (for  validation).   Complete
              security restrictions also are implemented.

       -verbose
              toggle  [LINK],  [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with
              filenames of these images.

       -version
              print version information.

       -vikeys
              enable vi-like key movement.

       -wdebug
              enable Waterloo tcp/ip packet debug (print to  watt
              debugfile).   This  applies  only  to  DOS versions
              compiled with WATTCP or WATT-32.

       -width=NUMBER
              number of columns for formatting of dumps,  default
              is 80.

       -with_backspaces
              emit   backspaces   in   output   if  -dump'ing  or
              -crawl'ing (like `man' does)

2 Commands
       o Use Up arrow and Down arrow to scroll through  hypertext
       links.
       o   Right  arrow  or  Return  will  follow  a  highlighted
       hypertext link.
       o Left Arrow will retreat from a link.
       o Type "H" or "?" for online help and descriptions of key-
       stroke commands.
       o  Type  "K" for a complete list of the current key-stroke
       command mappings.

2 Acknowledgments
       Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along
       the way.  The earliest versions of Lynx included code from
       Earl Fogel of Computing  Services  at  the  University  of
       Saskatchewan,  who  implemented HYPERREZ in the Unix envi-
       ronment.   HYPERREZ  was  developed  by  Niel  Larson   of
       Think.com  and  served as the model for the early versions
       of Lynx.  Those versions also incorporated libraries  from
       the  Unix  Gopher  clients  developed at the University of
       Minnesota, and the later versions of Lynx rely on the  WWW
       client  library  code developed by Tim Berners-Lee and the
       WWW community.  Also a special thanks to  Foteos  Macrides
       who  ported  much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most
       of its development since the departures  of  Lou  Montulli
       and  Garrett  Blythe  from the University of Kansas in the
       summer of 1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and  to  ev-
       eryone  on  the net who has contributed to Lynx's develop-
       ment either directly (through patches, comments or bug re-
       ports)  or indirectly (through inspiration and development
       of other systems).

       use "lynx -help" to display a complete list of current options.
d13 17
a29 14
       Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users  running
       cursor-addressable,   character-cell   display   devices  (e.g.,  vt100
       terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes,  or
       any other "curses-oriented" display).  It will display hypertext markup
       language (HTML) documents containing links to  files  residing  on  the
       local  system,  as  well  as  files  residing on remote systems running
       Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.  Current  versions  of  Lynx
       run on Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

       Lynx  can  be  used  to access information on the World Wide Web, or to
       build information systems intended primarily  for  local  access.   For
       example,  Lynx  has  been used to build several Campus Wide Information
       Systems (CWIS).  In  addition,  Lynx  can  be  used  to  build  systems
       isolated within a single LAN.
d32 19
a50 20
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL specified at
       the command line.  For help with URLs, press "?"  or "H" while  running
       Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."

       If  more  than  one  local  file or remote URL is listed on the command
       line, Lynx will open only the last interactively.   All  of  the  names
       (local files and remote URLs) are added to the G)oto history.

       Lynx  uses  only  long option names. Option names can begin with double
       dash as well, underscores and dashes can be intermixed in option  names
       (in  the reference below options are with one dash before them and with
       underscores).

       -      If the argument is only `-', then Lynx expects  to  receive  the
              arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the potentially very
              long command line that can be associated with the  -get_data  or
              -post_data  arguments (see below).  It can also be used to avoid
              having sensitive information in the invoking command line (which
              would be visible to other processes on most systems), especially
              when the -auth or -pauth options are used.

       -blink forces high intensity  background  colors  for  color  mode,  if
              available  and  supported  by the terminal.  This applies to the
              slang library (for a few terminal emulators),  or  to  OS/2  EMX
              with ncurses.

       -book  use  the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
              line startfile is still set for the  Main  screen  command,  and
              will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

              read  keystroke  commands  from the specified file.  You can use
              the data written using the -cmd_log option.   Lynx  will  ignore
              other  information which the command-logging may have written to
              the logfile.  Each line of the command script contains either  a
              comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:

            exit causes   the   script  to  stop,  and  forces  Lynx  to  exit
                 immediately.

            key  the character value, in printable  form.   Cursor  and  other
                 special   keys  are  given  as  names,  e.g.,  "Down  Arrow".
                 Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is, and  hexadecimal
                 values represent other 8-bit codes.

            set  followed  by a "name=value" allows one to override values set
                 in the lynx.cfg file.

       -color forces color mode  on,  if  available.   Default  color  control
              sequences  which work for many terminal types are assumed if the
              terminal capability description does not specify how  to  handle
              color.   Lynx  needs  to  be compiled with the slang library for
              this flag, it is equivalent to setting the COLORTERM environment
              variable.   (If  color  support  is instead provided by a color-
              capable curses library like ncurses, Lynx relies  completely  on
              the  terminal  description  to  determine  whether color mode is
              possible, and this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)   A
              saved  show_color=always  setting  found  in  a  .lynxrc file at
              startup has the same effect.  A saved show_color=never found  in

       In addition to various "standard" environment variables such  as  HOME,
       PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY, TMPDIR, etc, Lynx utilizes several Lynx-specific
       environment variables, if they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data to  an  external
       program, or for other reasons.  These are listed separately below.

       See  also  the  sections  on  SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and NATIVE LANGUAGE
       SUPPORT, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all  types  of  platforms
       supported  by  Lynx, though most do.  Feedback on platform dependencies
       is solicited.

                           the variable is ignored.   This  variable  is  only
                           meaningful  if  Lynx  was  built  using  the  slang
                           screen-handling library.

       LYNX_CFG            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           location  and name of the global configuration file
                           (normally,  lynx.cfg)  that  was  defined  by   the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE  constant  in  the  userdefs.h  file,
                           during installation.  See the userdefs.h  file  for
                           more information.

       LYNX_LOCALEDIR      If  set,  this  variable  overrides the compiled-in
                           location of the  locale  directory  which  contains
                           native language (NLS) message text.

       LYNX_LSS            This  variable,  if  set, specifies the location of
                           the  default  Lynx  character  style  sheet   file.

                           in the lynx.cfg  SAVE_SPACE:  statement.   See  the
                           lynx.cfg file for more information.

       LYNX_TEMP_SPACE     This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           path prefix for temporary files  that  was  defined
                           during  installation, as well as any value that may
                           be assigned to the TMPDIR variable.

       MAIL                This variable specifies the default inbox Lynx will
                           check  for new mail, if such checking is enabled in
                           the lynx.cfg file.

       NEWS_ORGANIZATION   This variable, if set, provides the string used  in
                           the  Organization:  header of USENET news postings.
                           It will override the setting  of  the  ORGANIZATION
                           environment  variable,  if  it is also set (and, on
                           UNIX, the contents of an /etc/organization file, if
                           present).

       NNTPSERVER          If  set,  this  variable specifies the default NNTP
                           server that will be used for  USENET  news  reading
                           and posting with Lynx, via news: URL's.

       ORGANIZATION        This  variable, if set, provides the string used in
                           the Organization: header of USENET  news  postings.
                           On  UNIX,  it  will  override  the  contents  of an
                           /etc/organization file, if present.

       PROTOCOL_proxy      Lynx supports the use of proxy servers that can act
                           as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are
                           preferable  to  the  older  gateway  servers   (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY,  below).  Each protocol used by
                           Lynx, (http,  ftp,  gopher,  etc),  can  be  mapped
                           separately  by setting environment variables of the
                           form   PROTOCOL_proxy    (literally:    http_proxy,
                           ftp_proxy,       gopher_proxy,       etc),       to
                           "http://some.server.dom:port/".   See  Lynx   Users

       WWW_access_GATEWAY  Lynx  still  supports  use of gateway servers, with
                           the  servers  specified  via   "WWW_access_GATEWAY"
                           variables  (where "access" is lower case and can be
                           "http", "ftp", "gopher" or  "wais"),  however  most
                           gateway  servers have been discontinued.  Note that
                           you do not include a terminal `/' for gateways, but
                           do   for   proxies   specified   by  PROTOCOL_proxy

                           details.

       WWW_HOME            This  variable,  if  set, will override the default

                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No

                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If

       LYNX_PRINT_URL      This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to   the   URL:   string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           URL" under VMS.

       LYNX_TRACE          If set, causes Lynx to write a trace file as if the
                           -trace option were supplied.

       LYNX_TRACE_FILE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace
                           file,  which  is  either Lynx.trace or LY-TRACE.LOG
                           (the latter on the DOS platform).  The  trace  file
                           is in either case relative to the home directory.

       LYNX_VERSION        This  variable  is  always  set by Lynx, and may be
                           used by an external program to determine if it  was
                           invoked  by  Lynx.   See  also  the comments in the
                           distribution's sample mailcap file,  for  notes  on
                           usage in such a file.

       TERM                Normally,   this   variable  is  used  by  Lynx  to
                           determine the terminal type being  used  to  invoke
                           Lynx.  If, however, it is unset at startup time (or
                           has the value "unknown"), or if the -term  command-
                           line  option  is  used (see OPTIONS section above),
                           Lynx will set or  modify  its  value  to  the  user
                           specified  terminal  type  (for  the Lynx execution
                           environment).  Note: If set/modified by  Lynx,  the
                           values  of  the  LINES  and/or  COLUMNS environment

       If built with the cgi-links option enabled, Lynx allows access to a cgi
       script directly without the need for an http daemon.

       When  executing  such  "lynxcgi  scripts"  (if  enabled), the following
       variables may be set for simulating a CGI environment:
d958 5
a962 4
       Other environment variables are not inherited  by  the  script,  unless
       they   are   provided   via  a  LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT  statement  in  the
       configuration file.  See the lynx.cfg file, and  the  (draft)  CGI  1.1
       Specification <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt>
d965 3
a967 2
       The CGI Specification, and other associated  documentation,  should  be
       consulted for general information on CGI script programming.

       If  configured  and  installed  with Native Language Support, Lynx will
       display status and other messages in your local language.  See the file
       ABOUT_NLS  in  the  source distribution, or at your local GNU site, for
       more information about internationalization.

       The following environment  variables  may  be  used  to  alter  default
       settings:

       LANG                This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           message language.  It is an ISO 639 two-letter code
                           identifying  the  language.  Language codes are NOT
                           the same as the country codes given in ISO 3166.

       LANGUAGE            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           message language.  This is a GNU extension that has
                           higher priority for  setting  the  message  catalog
                           than LANG or LC_ALL.
d994 10
a1003 8
       LC_MESSAGES         These  variables,  if  set,  specify  the notion of
                           native language formatting style.  They are POSIXly
                           correct.

       LINGUAS             This  variable,  if  set  prior  to  configuration,
                           limits the installed languages to specific  values.
                           It  is  a space-separated list of two-letter codes.
                           Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.
d1005 2
a1006 2
       NLSPATH             This variable, if set, is used as the  path  prefix
                           for message catalogs.

       Lynx  has  incorporated  code  from a variety of sources along the way.
       The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of  Comput-
       ing  Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPER-
       REZ in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson  of
       Think.com  and  served  as  the  model  for the early versions of Lynx.
       Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
       developed  at  the  University  of Minnesota, and the later versions of
       Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by  Tim  Berners-Lee
       and  the  WWW  community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
       ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
       since  the  departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the Uni-
       versity of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release of  v2.7.2,
       and  to  everyone  on the net who has contributed to Lynx's development
       either directly (through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirect-
       ly (through inspiration and development of other systems).

2 Description
       Lynx  is  a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for
       users running cursor-addressable,  character-cell  display
       devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on
       Windows  95/NT  or  Macintoshes,  or  any  other  "curses-
       oriented"  display).   It  will  display  hypertext markup
       language  (HTML)  documents  containing  links  to   files
       residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
       remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,  and  NNTP
       servers.   Current  versions  of  Lynx  run  on Unix, VMS,
       Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.
d21 4
a24 6
       Lynx can be used to access information on the  World  Wide
       Web,  or  to  build information systems intended primarily
       for local access.  For example,  Lynx  has  been  used  to
       build  several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
       addition, Lynx can  be  used  to  build  systems  isolated
       within a single LAN.
d26 4
a29 5
2 Options
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL
       specified at the command line.  For help with URLs,  press
       "?"   or  "H"  while  running  Lynx.  Then follow the link
       titled, "Help on URLs."
d31 6
a36 4
       Lynx uses only long option names. Option names  can  begin
       with  double  dash  as well, underscores and dashes can be
       intermixed in option names (in the reference below options
       are with one dash before them and with underscores).
d38 2
a39 9
       -      If  the  argument is only '-', then Lynx expects to
              receive the arguments from stdin.  This is to allow
              for the potentially very long command line that can
              be associated  with  the  -get_data  or  -post_data
              arguments  (see  below).   It  can  also be used to
              avoid having sensitive information in the  invoking
              command  line  (which  would  be  visible  to other
              processes on most  systems),  especially  when  the
              -auth or -pauth options are used.

       -auth=ID:PASSWD
              set authorization ID  and  password  for  protected
              documents  at  startup.   Be  sure  to  protect any
              script files which use this switch.

       -base  prepend a request  URL  comment  and  BASE  tag  to
              text/html outputs for -source dumps.

       -bibp=URL
              specify    a    local    bibp    server    (default
              http://bibhost/).
d72 5
a76 4
       -blink forces high intensity background colors  for  color
              mode,  if  available and supported by the terminal.
              This applies  to  the  slang  library  (for  a  few
              terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX with ncurses.
d78 2
a79 4
       -book  use  the  bookmark  page  as  the  startfile.   The
              default or command line startfile is still set  for
              the  Main  screen  command, and will be used if the
              bookmark page is unavailable or blank.
d81 2
a82 6
       -buried_news
              toggles  scanning  of  news  articles  for   buried
              references,  and  converts them to news links.  Not
              recommended because  email  addresses  enclosed  in
              angle  brackets  will  be  converted  to false news
              links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.
d84 2
a85 3
       -cache=NUMBER
              set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.   The
              default is 10.

              the specified file.
d109 2
a110 6
       -cmd_script=FILENAME
              read keystroke commands from  the  specified  file.
              You  can  use  the  data written using the -cmd_log
              option.  Lynx will ignore other  information  which
              the   command-logging   may  have  written  to  the
              logfile.
d112 2
a113 15
       -color forces color mode on, if available.  Default  color
              control  sequences  which  work  for  many terminal
              types  are  assumed  if  the  terminal   capability
              description  does  not specify how to handle color.
              Lynx needs to be compiled with  the  slang  library
              for  this  flag,  it  is  equivalent to setting the
              COLORTERM environment variable.  (If color  support
              is  instead  provided  by  a  color-capable  curses
              library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on the
              terminal  description  to  determine  whether color
              mode is possible, and this flag is not  needed  and
              thus   unavailable.)    A  saved  show_color=always
              setting found in a .lynxrc file at startup has  the
              same  effect.   A  saved  show_color=never found in
              .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.
d115 5
a119 4
       -connect_timeout=N
              Sets the connection timeout, where N  is  given  in
              seconds.   This is not available under DOS (use the
              sockdelay parameter of WATTCP under DOS).
d121 2
a122 4
       -cookie_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to read cookies.   If  none
              is  specified, the default value is ~/.lynx_cookies
              for most systems, but ~/cookies for MS-DOS.
d124 2
a125 4
       -cookie_save_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to store cookies.  If  none
              is  specified,  the  value given by -cookie_file is
              used.
d127 3
a129 2
       -cookies
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.
d131 2
a132 1
       -core  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.
d134 2
a135 3
       -crawl with -traversal, output each page to a file.   with
              -dump,  format  output  as  with -traversal, but to
              stdout.
d137 2
a138 3
       -curses_pads
              toggles the  use  of  curses  "pad"  feature  which
              supports left/right scrolling of the display.
d140 2
a141 3
       -debug_partial
              separate    incremental    display    stages   with
              MessageSecs delay
d143 2
a144 2
       -display=DISPLAY
              set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.
d146 2
a147 2
       -display_charset=MIMEname
              set the charset for the terminal output.
d149 2
a150 4
       -dont_wrap_pre
              inhibit wrapping of text in  <pre>  when  -dump'ing
              and  -crawl'ing,  mark wrapped lines in interactive
              session.
d152 2
a153 3
       -dump  dumps the formatted output of the default  document
              or  one  specified  on the command line to standard
              output.  This can be used in the following way:

d158 2
a159 3
       -editor=EDITOR
              enable  external  editing,  using   the   specified
              EDITOR. (vi, ed, emacs, etc.)
d161 2
a162 2
       -emacskeys
              enable emacs-like key movement.
d164 2
a165 4
       -enable_scrollback
              toggles  compatibility with communication programs'
              scrollback keys  (may  be  incompatible  with  some
              curses packages).
d167 3
a169 3
       -error_file=FILE
              define  a  file  where Lynx will report HTTP access
              codes.
d171 4
a174 2
       -exec  enable  local  program  execution   (normally   not
              configured).
d176 2
a177 3
       -fileversions
              include   all   versions  of  files  in  local  VMS
              directory listings.
d179 2

              traverse all http  links  derived  from  startfile.
              When  used  with -crawl, each link that begins with
              the same string as startfile is output to  a  file,
              intended for indexing.  See CRAWL.announce for more
              information.

       trim_input_fields
              trim input text/textarea fields in forms.

       -underscore
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       -use_mouse
              turn on mouse support, if available.  Clicking  the
              left mouse button on a link traverses it.  Clicking
              the right mouse button pops back.  Click on the top
              line  to  scroll  up.   Click on the bottom line to
              scroll down.  The first few positions  in  the  top
              and  bottom  line  may invoke additional functions.
              Lynx must be compiled  with  ncurses  or  slang  to
              support this feature.  If ncurses is used, clicking
              the middle mouse button  pops  up  a  simple  menu.
              Mouse  clicks  may only work reliably while Lynx is
              idle waiting for input.

       -useragent=Name
              set alternate Lynx User-Agent header.

       -validate
              accept only http URLs (for  validation).   Complete
              security restrictions also are implemented.

       -verbose
              toggle  [LINK],  [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with
              filenames of these images.

       -version
              print version information.

       -vikeys
              enable vi-like key movement.

       -wdebug
              enable Waterloo tcp/ip packet debug (print to  watt
              debugfile).   This  applies  only  to  DOS versions
              compiled with WATTCP or WATT-32.

       -width=NUMBER
              number of columns for formatting of dumps,  default
              is 80.

       -with_backspaces
              emit  backspaces in output if -dumping or -crawling
              (like 'man' does)

2 Commands
       o Use Up arrow and Down arrow to scroll through  hypertext
       links.
       o   Right  arrow  or  Return  will  follow  a  highlighted
       hypertext link.
       o Left Arrow will retreat from a link.
       o Type "H" or "?" for online help and descriptions of key-
       stroke commands.
       o  Type  "K" for a complete list of the current key-stroke
       command mappings.

       such  as  HOME,  PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY,  TMPDIR, etc, Lynx
       utilizes several Lynx-specific environment  variables,  if
       they exist.

2 Acknowledgments
       Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along
       the way.  The earliest versions of Lynx included code from
       Earl Fogel of Computing  Services  at  the  University  of
       Saskatchewan,  who  implemented HYPERREZ in the Unix envi-
       ronment.   HYPERREZ  was  developed  by  Niel  Larson   of
       Think.com  and  served as the model for the early versions
       of Lynx.  Those versions also incorporated libraries  from
       the  Unix  Gopher  clients  developed at the University of
       Minnesota, and the later versions of Lynx rely on the  WWW
       client  library  code developed by Tim Berners-Lee and the
       WWW community.  Also a special thanks to  Foteos  Macrides
       who  ported  much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most
       of its development since the departures  of  Lou  Montulli
       and  Garrett  Blythe  from the University of Kansas in the
       summer of 1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and  to  ev-
       eryone  on  the net who has contributed to Lynx's develop-
       ment either directly (through patches, comments or bug re-
       ports)  or indirectly (through inspiration and development
       of other systems).

<h1>+++ X Terminal or X Server +++</h1>

An X terminal is an electronic display terminal that communicates
with a host computer system using the X Window protocol developed at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<p>The X Window protocol allows a program running on the host computer
system to display both formatted text and graphics on the X terminal.
Since the X Window protocol is defined to work over any TCP/IP network,
X terminals connected to the Internet can be connected to hosts
located anywhere on the Internet.

<p>Personal computers (including both PCs and Macintoshes) can execute
programs, usually called X servers, that make them act like X Window
terminals and are frequently used as X terminals.

<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The terminology used to describe processes associated with X
    terminals can be confusing.  An X terminal is also known as
    an "X display server," and the program running on the host
    computer is usually known as the "X client."

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

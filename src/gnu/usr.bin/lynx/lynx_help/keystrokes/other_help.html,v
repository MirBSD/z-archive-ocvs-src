<PRE>
       a      - Places the link that you are currently positioned
                on into a personal <A HREF="bookmark_help.html">bookmark file</A>.

       c      - Allows you to send a mail message to the owner
                or maintainer of the data that you are currently
                viewing.  In the case that no owner is known,
                you cannot send a comment.

       d      - Downloads the file pointed to by the current link
                and displays an option menu allowing the file to
                be saved or transferred by configurable options.
                Can also be used when positioned on a form SUBMIT
                button to download the reply to a form submission.

       e      - Allows you to edit the current document if it is a
                local file.

       E      - Allows you to edit the current link's URL (or ACTION) and
                use that as a <em>goto</em> URL.

       g      - Allows you to enter any <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URL</a> or filename that
                you wish to view, and then <em>goto</em> it.

       G      - Allows you to edit the current document's URL and use that
                as a <em>goto</em> URL.

     ? or H   - Hypertext help to explain how to navigate in
                Lynx and use its features.

       i      - Shows an index of files or subjects,
                which may be changed in <em>lynx.cfg</em>.

       j      - Allows you to enter a short name to goto an URL,
                if a jumps file has been defined.  Press "?"
                and ENTER to see the list of defined jump commands.

       k      - Shows a list of key mappings.  Keys remapped in
                "lynx.cfg" show up in this list.

       l      - Brings up a list of references (links) in the current
                document, which can be used for rapid access to the
                links in large documents.

       m      - Returns to the first screen and empties the
                history stack.

       p      - Brings up a list of <A HREF="print_help.html">print commands</A>.

       o      - Brings up a list of settable <A HREF="option_help.html">options</A>.

       q      - Quits Lynx. ('Q' quits without asking)

       /      - Search for a string of characters in the current document
                (case insensitive or case sensitive
                depending on the <A HREF="option_help.html">options</A> set).

       s      - Search through an external searchable indexed document.

       n      - Move to the next instance of a search string if you
                have searched previously.

       v      - View a <A HREF="bookmark_help.html">Bookmark file</A>.

       V      - Go to the <A HREF="visited_help.html">Visited Links Page</A>

       x      - Force submission of form or link with no-cache.

       z      - Abort a network transfer in progress.  If any partial
                data has been transferred it will be displayed.

  &lt;backspace&gt; - displays the <a href="history_help.html">History Page</A>.

       =      - Show information about the file and link that you
                are currently viewing.

       \      - Toggles between viewing the HTML source of a
                document and the rendered version of the document.

       !      - Spawns your default operating system shell.

       '      - Toggles "historical" vs minimal or valid comment parsing.
                When historical, any close-angle-bracket will be treated
                as a comment terminator, emulating the parsing bug in old
                versions of Mosaic and Netscape, rather than validly
                requiring pairs of two successive dashes to delimit
                comments within the angle-brackets.

       _      - Clears all authorization info for the current session.  Can
                be used when leaving one's terminal without ending the Lynx
                session, to guard against someone else retrieving protected
                documents with previously entered username/password info.
                Note that any protected documents that are still in cache
                can still be accessed.

       `      - Toggles minimal or valid comment parsing.  When minimal, any
                two successive dashes followed by a close-angle-bracket will
                be treated as a comment terminator, emulating the parsing bug
                in Netscape v2.0.  If historical comment parsing is set, that
                will override minimal or valid comment parsing.

       *      - Toggles image_links mode on and off.  When on, links will
                be created for all images, including inlines.

       @@      - Toggles raw 8-bit translations or CJK mode on and off, only
                for documents which does not specify character set explicitly.
                Should be on when the document's charset matches the
                display character set, and otherwise off so that 8-bit
                characters will be translated by Lynx with respect to the
                Assumed document charset, using approximations if necessary
                (see <A HREF="option_help.html">options</A>).

       [      - Toggles pseudo_inlines mode on and off.  When on, inline
                images which have no ALT string specified will have an
                "[INLINE]" pseudo-ALT string inserted in the Lynx display.
                When off, they will be treated as having ALT="" (i.e.,
                they'll be ignored).  If image_links mode is toggled on,
                the pseudo-ALT strings will be restored, to serve as links
                to the inline images' sources.

       ]      - Sends a HEAD request for the current document or link.  It
                applies only to documents or links (or form submit buttons)
                of http servers.  A statusline message will notify you if
                the context for this command was inappropriate.  The HEAD
                requests always are sent to the http server, i.e., Lynx
                does not retrieve any previous server replies from its
                cache.  Note that for form submissions, http servers vary
                in whether they'll treat HEAD requests as valid and return
                the CGI script's headers, or treat it as invalid and return
                an error message.

       "      - Toggles valid or "soft" double-quote parsing.  When soft,
                a close-angle-bracket will serve as both a close-double-
                quote and close-tag, emulating the parsing bug in old
                versions of Mosaic and Netscape.

     CTRL-R   - Reloads the current document and resets the display.

     CTRL-V   - Switches to an alternative way of parsing HTML documents.
                This may help to get a more readable rendering of some
                documents with invalidly placed HTML tags, <A
                HREF="option_help.html#tagsoup">more details</A>.

     CTRL-W   - Resets or cleans up the display.

     CTRL-U   - Clears text from an input field or prompt.

     CTRL-G   - Cancels any input prompt, mail message or data transfer.

     CTRL-T   - Toggles trace mode on and off.

       ;      - Views the Lynx Trace Log for the current session.

     CTRL-K   - Invokes the Cookie Jar Page.

     numbers  - Lynx offers other, advanced navigation features when
                numbers are used to invoke the
                  <a href="follow_help.html"
                  >Follow link (or goto link or page) number:</a> or
                  <a href="follow_help.html#select-option"
                  >Select option (or page) number:</a>
                prompts.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

<h1>+++DEFAULT BINDING+++</h1>

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Alternative key bindings can be offered
by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in LYEditmap.c
before compiling Lynx.  If available, they may
be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in the
'.lynxrc' file.

<p>Two such alternative key bindings, which may be available on your system,
are the <A HREF="alt_edit_help.html">Alternative Binding</A> keymap and the
<A HREF="bashlike_edit_help.html">Bash-like Binding</A> keymap.

<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no effect on line-editor bindings.

<p>This is the <em>Default Binding</em> keymap:

<pre>
     ENTER  Input complete        -  RETURN
     TAB    Input complete        -  TAB, Do
     ABORT  Input cancelled       -  Ctrl-G, Ctrl-O, (Ctrl-C on some systems)
     ERASE  Erase the line        -  Ctrl-U

     BACK   Cursor back     char  -  Left-Arrow
     FORW   Cursor forward  char  -  Right-Arrow
     BACKW  Cursor back     word  -  Ctrl-P
     FORWW  Cursor forward  word  -  Ctrl-N
     BOL    Go to begin of  line  -  Ctrl-A, Home, Find
     EOL    Go to end   of  line  -  Ctrl-E, End,  Select

     DELP   Delete prev     char  -  Ctrl-H, DELETE, Remove
     DELN   Delete next [1] char  -  Ctrl-D, Ctrl-R
     DELPW  Delete prev     word  -  Ctrl-B
     DELNW  Delete next     word  -  Ctrl-F
     DELEL  Delete to end of line -  Ctrl-_

     UPPER  Upper case the line   -  Ctrl-T
     LOWER  Lower case the line   -  Ctrl-K

     LKCMD  Invoke cmd prompt     -  Ctrl-V (in form text fields, only) [2]
     SWMAP  Switch input keymap   -  Ctrl-^ (if compiled in)

<A NAME="TASpecial">Special commands for use only in textarea fields</A>[3]:

          Textarea external edit  - Ctrl-X e
          Insert file in textarea - Ctrl-X i
          Grow textarea           - Ctrl-X g

[1] "next" means the character "under" a box or underline style cursor; it
     means "to the immediate right of" an I-beam (between characters) type
     cursor.

[2]  Follow Ctrl-V with any recognized key command, to "escape" from a text
     input field.

[3]  For other key combinations using Ctrl-X as a prefix key, see the
     Help page for the <a rel="Sibling" title="Bash-Like Binding"
                        href="bashlike_edit_help.html"
                      >Bash-Like</a> Binding.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

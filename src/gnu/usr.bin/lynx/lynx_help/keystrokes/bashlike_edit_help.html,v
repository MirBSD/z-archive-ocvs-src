<h1>+++BASH-LIKE BINDING+++</h1>

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Several sets of key-bindings can be offered
by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in
LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx.  If available,
they may be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in
the '.lynxrc' file.

<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no direct effect on line-editor bindings.

<p>This is the <em>Bash-like Binding</em> keymap.</p>
<h2>Basic commands</h2>
<pre>
     ENTER  Input complete        -  Enter, RETURN
     TAB    Completion [2]/ Next  -  TAB, Do
     ABORT  Cancel / Undo Change  -  C-g, C-_
     ERASE  Erase the line        -  M-k, C-x k

     BACK   Cursor back     char  -  Left-Arrow,  C-b
     FORW   Cursor forward  char  -  Right-Arrow, C-f
     BACKW  Cursor back     word  -  M-b, C-r
     FORWW  Cursor forward  word  -  M-f, C-s [5]
     BOL    Go to begin of  line  -  C-a, Home, Find
     EOL    Go to end   of  line  -  C-e [4], End,  Select

     DELP   Delete prev     char  -  C-h, Backspace, Rubout
     DELN   Delete next [1] char  -  C-d, Delete, Remove
     DELPW  Delete prev     word  -  C-w [3], M-Backspace, M-Delete (?)
     DELNW  Delete next     word  -  M-d
     DELBL  Delete to beg of line -  C-u
     DELEL  Delete to end of line -  C-k [4]

     UPPER  Upper case the line   -  M-u
     LOWER  Lower case the line   -  M-l

     LKCMD  Invoke cmd prompt     -  C-v [FORM]
     SWMAP  Switch input keymap   -  C-^ (if compiled in)

<A NAME="TASpecial">Special commands for use in textarea fields</A> [FORM]:

     PASS!  Textarea external edit  - C-e C-e [4], C-x e
     PASS!  Insert file in textarea - C-x i
     PASS!  Grow textarea           - C-x g

</pre>
Here is a little textarea for practice:<BR>
<FORM action=""><TEXTAREA name="practice" cols=40 ROWS=5>
This text cannot be submitted.  Normally lines like
these would be part of a form that is filled out and
then submitted.  You can move around here and delete
or add text as you like, using the Line-Editor keys.
</TEXTAREA><INPUT TYPE=reset VALUE="[reset content]"></FORM>
<pre>

Advanced emacs-like commands:

    TPOS    Transpose characters                   -  C-t
    SETMARK Set mark at current position in line   -  C-@@
    XPMARK  Exchange current position with mark    -  C-x C-x
    KILLREG Kill region between mark and position  -  C-x C-w [3]
    YANK    Insert text last killed (with KILLREG) -  C-y
</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<P><samp>
     <DFN>C-</DFN><strong>key</strong> means Control+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.  <DFN
     ><code>C-x </code></DFN><strong>key</strong> means first Control+<kbd>x</kbd>, then
     <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
                                                                       <DFN
                        >M-</DFN>key means Meta+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>, where Meta
     is a modifier that can be entered in a variety of ways:
</samp></P><UL>
<LI>First ESC, then the <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
    This doesn't work with all systems or on all connections, and if it
    does may not work for some keys (because the ESC character is also
    part of code sequences for "normal" function keys).
<LI>Alt+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
    This works if the terminal, console, or comm program is set up to
    interpret Alt as a modifier to send ESC.  The Linux console acts
    like that by default for most keys;  Kermit can be set up to do it,
    xterm can be for some keys, and so on.  But the same caveats as for
    the previous item apply.
    This Alt mapping may also be possible, independent of the ESC character,
    for some keys in Lynx for DOS/i386 or for Win32.
<LI>C-x <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
    Actually, currently the same internal table is used for Meta and the
    C-x prefix.  Therefore all M-<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong> combinations can
    also be typed as C-x <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>, and vice versa.
</UL><pre>
[1] "next" means the character "under" a box or underline style cursor; it
    means "to the immediate right of" an I-beam (between characters) type
    cursor.
[2] For entering strings in response to prompts (that is, when not editing
    form text fields), some keys have different actions: TAB tries to
    complete input based on previous response; Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow
    may offer previous response and next response, respectively, from
    recall buffer for some prompts.
[3] C-w can only be used for editing functions if its default KEYMAP
    to REFRESH is changed.  This can be done in the lynx.cfg file,
    for example with the line "KEYMAP:^W:DO_NOTHING".  This also applies
    for other keys: as long as the key's action is mapped to REFRESH,
    either with an explicit KEYMAP in lynx.cfg or by default, the
    key's Line Editor binding is disabled.
[4] These keys invoke special behavior when pressed twice in a row:
    C-e C-e calls the external editor for changing the text in a
    textarea (if available).  C-k C-k will move to the next link,
    so that all lines in a textarea can be conveniently cleared by
    repeating C-k.
[5] Key is likely unavailable for Lynx, because it is interpreted by
    operating system, comm program, or curses library, or swallowed
    as part of escape sequence recognition.  Binding is provided for
    the benefit of those where this doesn't apply.
[FORM] In form text fields, only.  Ignored by Line Editor elsewhere.


More notes

   When a text input field, including a textarea line, is selected,
   the Line Editor functions get a first grab at the keys entered.
   If a key has no function defined in the Line Editor binding, it
   can either be ignored, or passed on for normal key command handling,
   where modifiers like C-x or Meta currently have no effect (see the
   <A HREF="LYNXKEYMAP:"
   >Key Map Page</A> accessible with the key <kbd>K</kbd> for current information).

Meta + other (mostly, printable character) keys:
              Modifier ignored, or sequence swallowed (see [5]).
            M-@@, M-E...M-Z [5], M-\, M-^, M-_ attempt to interpret
              as 7-bit escape representation for character in 8-bit
              control (C1) range if appropriate according to
              Display Character Set.


[emacskey] Normal key action subject to emacs_keys setting.
[!] Action of key with Meta modifier follows action of key without
    Meta.  If you manage to enter the Meta key while Line-Editor
    Binding is not set to Bash-Like, and the unmodified binding
    is different from that listed here, M-&lt;<var>key</var>&gt; will act
    like &lt;<var>key</var>&gt;.

<a href="about_lynx.html">About Lynx</a> ]
</blockquote>

<h1><em>The Lynx Development Process</em></h1>
<p>
Lynx is maintained and improved by an international co-operative
of volunteers.  Newcomers are welcome to join the group:
you needn't be a super programmer, but you should be prepared
to listen and learn, as well as to contribute patches if you can.
Since everyone is a volunteer, you will usually be expected
to try to implement any suggestions you make.

<h1><em>Lynx-Dev Discussion List</em></h1>
<p>
The developers communicate through a majordomo mailing list
-- see below for details -- , which is open to interested users
as well as programmers.  Topics include fixing bugs, increasing
Lynx's tools and powers, meeting the ever-changing demands
of the Internet and porting Lynx to new systems.
<p>
Anyone may read what has been said on the list by visiting
<a href="http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/">&nbsp;the Archive</a>.

<h1><em>Development Versions of Lynx</em></h1>
<p>
Besides <em>releases</em>, which are stable versions of Lynx
which come out once or twice a year and can be obtained
from <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/release/">the release site</a>,
there are <em>development</em> versions,
which are experimental -- though usually stable enough to use --
and appear every few weeks, depending on current activity.
You can find the latest <em>development</em> version of Lynx
by visiting
<a href="http://lynx.isc.org/current/">the development site</a>.

<h1><em>Subscribing to Lynx-Dev</em></h1>
<p>
If you are interested in joining the Lynx mailing list,
send e-mail to <a href="mailto:majordomo@@sig.net">&nbsp;majordomo@@sig.net</a>
with only the following request in the body of your message:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribe lynx-dev (address)
<p>
where your e-address is optional if it can be obtained correctly
from the mail headers of your subscription request. You will need
to answer one follow-up question to confirm you want to subscribe.
Majordomo will then enroll you and send all messages
which you address to <em>lynx-dev@@sig.net</em> to all subscribers;
you will also receive all messages sent by other subscribers.
<p>
NOTE: Subject headers are ignored when (un)subscribing.

<h1><em>Unsubscribing from Lynx-Dev</em></h1>
<p>
To <em>unsubscribe</em>, send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@@sig.net">&nbsp;majordomo@@sig.net</a>
with only the following request in the body of your message:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unsubscribe lynx-dev (address)
<p>
where your e-address is optional if it can be obtained correctly
from the mail headers of your subscription request.

<h1><em>Casual Inquiries</em></h1>
<p>
Anyone may ask a question or offer a comment by sending e-mail
to <a href="mailto:lynx-dev@@sig.net">&nbsp;the list</a>.
Since all subscribers are volunteers,
you depend on their goodwill and will be more likely
to get a response if you give the e-mail a meaningful `Subject'
and include details of your version of Lynx, hardware and software.
You can check the Archive to find any responses.<p>
Messages from non-subscribers are not immediately distributed
to avoid spam.  Usually, if your message appears genuine,
it will be retrieved from the pile headed for the wastebasket
within a day or so and distributed to the list.
For best results, subscribe as described above.

<h1><em>Subscribing to Lynx-Dev-Contrib</em></h1>
<p>
If you simply want to contribute e-mail to the list
without receiving the sometimes heavy discussion as well,
you can subscribe to <em>lynx-dev-contrib</em> instead.
E-mail from the address you subscribe will be recognized
as from a subscriber and automatically distributed to the list,
but no e-mail will be sent from the list to you. If you have
multiple accounts from which you want to post to the list,
subscribe one of them to lynx-dev to receive the list mail
and the others to lynx-dev-contrib.
<p>
To subscribe to lynx-dev-contrib, send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@@sig.net">&nbsp;majordomo@@sig.net</a>
with only the following request in the body of your message:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribe lynx-dev-contrib (address)

<h1><em>Majordomo Commands</em></h1>
<p>
To receive a brief description of majordomo <em>commands</em>,
send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@@sig.net">&nbsp;majordomo@@sig.net</a>
with only the following request in the body of your message:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;help
<p>
You will receive by return e-mail a list of commands.
Further information is available from the
<a href="http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/">&nbsp;majordomo website</a>.
<p>
If you have problems with majordomo not responding to requests,
send e-mail to the <em>list owner</em>:
<a href="mailto:majordomo-owner@@sig.net">&nbsp;majordomo-owner@@sig.net</a>.
PLEASE DO NOT send them to <em>lynx-dev@@sig.net</em>,
where they would be distributed to everyone on the list,
causing irritation by cluttering their mailboxes.

<h1><em>The Lynx-Dev Archive</em></h1>
<p>
Messages posted to lynx-dev are archived in html format
so that you can view them using Lynx: go to the
<a href="http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/">HTML Archive</a>.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

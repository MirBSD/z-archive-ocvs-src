$!
$!	FIXED512.COM:	Uses the FILE utility or SET FILE/ATTR
$!			to convert binary stream_LF file headers
$!			to FIXED 512.
$!
$!	Author:	F.Macrides (macrides@@sci.wfeb.edu)
$!
$!	Usage:  @@Lynx_Dir:FIXED512 <stream_LF file that's actually binary>
$!
$!	Lynx performs the conversion via internal code if the file is
$!	recognized as binary.  This command procedure can be used externally
$!	if that detection failed, e.g., for binary files downloaded from FTP
$!      servers with extensions that hadn't been mapped to a binary MIME
$!	type in the Lynx configuration files.
$! 
$!===========================================================================
$!
$!  Get and build Joe Meadow's FILE utility for VAX and AXP:
$!	ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/fileserv/file.zip
$!  and define it here, or system-wide, as a foreign command.
$!
$! FILE := $device:[directory]FILE.EXE
$!-----------------------------------------------------------
$!
$!  Just exit and leave the file stream_LF if we didn't get
$!  the filename as P1, or if it's not a valid file spec.
$!
$ IF P1 .EQS. "" THEN EXIT
$ IF F$SEARCH(P1) .EQS. "" THEN EXIT
$!-----------------------------------------------------------
$!
$!  If we have FILE installed, use it.
$!
$ If f$type(FILE) .eqs. "STRING"
$ Then
$  FILE 'P1'-
   /TYPE=FIXED -
   /ATTRIBUTES=NOIMPLIEDCC -
   /CHARACTERISTICS=BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS -
   /RECORD_SIZE=512 -
   /MAXIMUM_RECORD_SIZE=512
$  EXIT
$ EndIf
$!-----------------------------------------------------------
$!
$!  If we get to here, and we're VMS v6+,
$!  we'll use SET FILE/ATTR to do it.
$!
$ If f$extract(1,1,f$getsyi("VERSION")) .ge. 6
$ Then
$   SET FILE/ATTR=(RFM:FIX,LRL:512,MRS:512,RAT:NONE) 'P1'

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Upgrade lynx to 2.8.5dev.17d, retaining local changes if needed
@
text
@This file lists preprocessor macros (symbols) which are tested in the
code (typically with ifdef).

Does not include
- symbols defined and documented in userdefs.h
- symbols expected to be set by compiler to indicate system type or
  compiler features
- many symbols set and used only in connection with the ./configure
  mechanism - the full and current list can be found in config.hin
  (as a template) or, after running ./configure, in lynx_cfg.h.
- most symbols and macros defined in the source code

***Not complete.***

A. Symbols primarily to enable compilation on specific systems
==============================================================
See also under B for things needed by some systems.

# if you have an SVR4 system with the "type any key" problem, try defining
#
# -DSVR4_BSDSELECT

# Old Data General systems may need this in their SITE_LYDEFS
# for their inet_addr(host) calls.
#
# -DDGUX_OLD

---
Ports have been added for Win32 (95/NT) and 386 DOS computers with a
packet driver.  I created four new defines to accomplish this.
	_WINDOWS Defined for Win32 specific code (Mostly TCP related)
	DJGPP    Defined for 386 specific code (Mostly TCP related)
	DOSPATH  Defined for any DOS'ish computer
	NOSIGHUP Defined for computers not supporting sighup signal calls.
-- Wayne Buttles lynx-port@@fdisk.com

Added for 8+3 filesystems (DOS):
	FNAMES_8_3  also defined in userdefs.h if __DJGPP__

* incorporate changes for win32 by Hiroyuki Senshu <senshu@@shonai-cit.ac.jp>
  (SH) from
    ftp://crab.it.osha.sut.ac.jp/pub/Win32/develope/senshu/Lynx/
  Most changes are ifdef'd
    #define _WIN_CC=    .... for Windows C Compiler
    #define CJK_EX      .... CJK EXtension
    #define SH_EX       .... Senshu Hiroyuki EXtension
    #define WIN_EX      .... Windows EXtension


B. Symbols to enable or disable specific features, mostly
=========================================================
Note that some of these may be only usable on some system types,
most were originally for UNIX.

Network related, specific protocols
-----------------------------------
# -DSOCKS          For making a SOCKSified lynx.
       			see comments in makefile.in
# -DSHORTENED_RBIND  For a SOCKSified lynx with the short version of Rbind.
               		see comments in makefile.in

Related to DirEd code - probably only usable for UNIX or similar
----------------------------------------------------------------
# -DDIRED_SUPPORT  (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_GZIP        (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_OVERRIDE    (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_PERMIT      (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_TAR         (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_UUDECODE    (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_ZIP         (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DOK_INSTALL     to enable dired menu "Install" function
# -DARCHIVE_ONLY   (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DNO_CHANGE_EXECUTE_PERMS (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DCANT_EDIT_UNWRITABLE_FILES (see LYEdit.c - always in effect for VMS)

Related to formatting of local directory listings
-------------------------------------------------
# -DLONG_LIST      (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DNO_PARENT_DIR_REFERENCE (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)

Related to screen display
-------------------------
Using curses or ncurses library:
# -DNCURSES        (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DFANCY_CURSES   whether curses lib supports more than very basic stuff
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure, for VMS defined in code
# -DNO_KEYPAD (old) or HAVE_KEYPAD (new)   whether curses lib uses keypad().
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure, may be set in HTUtils.h
# -DCOLOR_CURSES    whether curses lib supports color (in the right way).
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure
# -DUSE_COLOR_STYLE (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c) needs SVr4 curses
# -DUNDERLINE_LINKS  Define if you want links underlined instead of bold.
# -DHP_TERMINAL    For DIM workaround to REVERSE problems on HP terminals.
# -DNO_SIZECHANGE (old) or HAVE_SIZECHANGE (new) whether using code to detect
                   new size after size changes of the terminal (window).
                   for UNIX handled by ./configure, may be set in HTUtils.h
# -DUSE_SCROLLBAR  supports scrollbar when built with ncurses
# -DWIDEC_CURSES   whether curses lib supports wide/multibyte characters.

Using slang library:
# -DUSE_SLANG      (see INSTALLATION, Section II-1c)
# -DSLANG_MBCS_HACK prevent cutoff lines when using UTF8 console (slang only)
Both:
# -DREVERSE_CLEAR_SCREEN_PROBLEM
# 	if you have the reverse clear screen problem of some SUN4 systems, or
# 	to work around some other "garbage on the screen" problems

Other general
-------------
# -DEXP_ASCII_CTYPES use POSIX locale for toupper/tolower/isupper
# -DIGNORE_CTRL_C  Define if Control-C shouldn't exit lynx.
# -DINACTIVE_INPUT_STYLE_VH  Different style for showing inactive text fields
# -DMISC_EXP       Enable some truly experimental stuff
# -DNO_DUMP_WITH_BACKSPACES Disables -with_backspaces code
# -DNO_RULES	   Disables code for CERN-style rules files
# -DUSE_VASPRINT   Use vasprintf() function

Untested
--------
# -DNO_EXTENDED_HTMLDTD	Disable some "SortaSGML" code, see SGML.c
# -DWIND_DOWN_STACK Aggressive handling of end tags for "TagSoup", SGML.c

C. Secondary symbols
====================
Some macros that are not primary, i.e. they are normally automatically
set or unset in the code based on other macros (including those from
./configure), but it may be sometimes useful to set them differently.
They may directly affect several source files.  Filenames show where
they are set.  Normally installers shouldn't have to care about these
symbols.

COOKIE_FILE		LYMain.c	default cookie file in HOME dir
SHOW_WHEREIS_TARGETS	LYCurses.h	whereis search highlighting
USE_KEYMAPS		LYCurses.h	use of .lynx-keymaps files

D. Symbols defined locally to modify some behavior
==================================================
Defined in the source files to which they apply.  Only filenames are listed,
the files would have to be read and edited anyway to change the definition.
Normally installers shouldn't have to care about any of these symbols.

1.1.3.2
log
@Lynx 2.8.5dev.17 Patchlevel d

This fixes, among many others, the following:
* correct some mismatches between INSTALLATION and "configure --help" (prompted
  by discussion with Stef Caunter) -TD
* amend check for refresh-URL to ensure it only prepends a link for text/html
  content type (report by Carlton Anderson).
* do not strip parameters from refresh-URL (report by Carlton Anderson gave an
  example of their use) -TD
* remove obsolete XMOSAIC_HACK defines -TD
* improve check for Unix-style shell given in $SHELL by limiting the check to
  the base-name (discussion with GV, DK) -TD
* modify increment_tagged_htline() to reallocate its HTLine parameter if the
  result would be larger than the allocation.  This can happen when a large
  textarea is adjusted (report by Thorsten Glaser)  -TD
* add ifdef'd logic to change HTLine to calloc() rather than memory pools,
  making it possible to use valgrind, etc., for debugging -LP
* add check for broken ProFTPD 1.2.5rc1, e.g., at ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub,
  and force a reconnection if an error 550 is detected when doing RETR.  This
  is ifdef'd with BROKEN_PROFTPD and checks version (reports by GV, DK) -TD
* modify file-upload to not print a warning message if the form-field is empty
  (Frank Heckenbach).
* add a few null-pointer checks to GridText.c (addresses symptoms reported by
  Frederic L W Meunier when nested-tables are toggled off) -TD
* modify LYTrimNewline() to trim carriage-returns as well as line-feeds, making
  it possible to share cookie files between platforms that have different
  line-terminations (report by Frederic L W Meunier) -TD
* rename EXP_PERSISTENT_COOKIES ifdef to USE_PERSISTENT_COOKIES -TD
* rename EXP_READPROGRESS ifdef to USE_READPROGRESS -TD
* rename SOURCE_CACHE ifdef to USE_SOURCE_CACHE -TD
* change a few configure script defaults to "enable":  source-cache, prettysrc
  and read-eta.  Also change default for read-eta configuration flag to "Show
  KB/Sec" (requests by LP, Frederic L W Meunier) -TD
* change configure script to compile-in file-upload by default, change its
  corresponding ifdef to USE_FILE_UPLOAD -TD
* revert table-layout changes from dev.15/dev.16 because of unresolved
  issues -TD
* add configure option --with-bzlib -TD
* implement support for bzip compression by internal calls to libbz2 -IZ
* if a document is in the cache (the rendering is in memory), on reload it
  should not be cleared from the cache until the connection to the server is
  opened; if the connection fails, the user will reuse the old version (request
  by IZ) -LP
* correct strings in LYOptions.c so ENABLE_LYNXRC works for bookmark_file
  and run_all_execution_links -DK
* fix pathname generated for "View temporary file" in LYDownload.c using new
  function LYAddPathToSave() (report by P.J.Walsh) -TD
* change code to match lynx.cfg description for FORCE_COOKIE_PROMPT and
  FORCE_SSL_PROMPT, making "prompt" rather than "default" the keyword to use
  when telling lynx to prompt (report by DK) -TD
* modify ifdef's to use mkdtemp() if it is available (prompted by MirBSD
  patch) -TD
* several fixes from Thorsten Glaser (MirBSD):
  + workaround for invoking shell scripts when executable permissions are
    discarded as a result from using CVS.
  + adjust buffer-size used in a readlink() call in case the result is too
    long to include trailing null.
  + change default ftp mode to passive.
  + if ftp connection fails, automatically retry, switching between passive
    and active modes.  Do this retry switching only when connecting to a
    different host.  A new variable ftp_local_passive distinguishes this
    from the user preference in ftp_passive.
  + improved certificate handling (case-insensitive domain-comparison, strip
    port-numbers from comparison).
  + fix a few typos & compiler-warnings.
* modify configure script to not use "head -1", which does not work for some
  platforms when POSIXLY_CORRECT (sic) is set -TD
* fix configure script check for term.h, which may be <ncursesw/term.h> -TD
* amend change in dev.15 to HTParse() to escape spaces, to exclude non-URL
  strings such as absolute filenames (report by Patrick Ash) -TD
* modify LYParseTagParam() (added in dev.13) to not stop on ';' (fixes a bug
  reported by LV which broke complicated refresh-URL containing "&amp;") -TD
* change default start page to lynx.isc.org, since lynx.browser.org is not
  maintained -TD

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

C. Secondary symbols
====================
Some macros that are not primary, i.e. they are normally automatically
set or unset in the code based on other macros (including those from
./configure), but it may be sometimes useful to set them differently.
They may directly affect several source files.  Filenames show where
they are set.  Normally installers shouldn't have to care about these
symbols.

COOKIE_FILE		LYMain.c	default cookie file in HOME dir
SHOW_WHEREIS_TARGETS	LYCurses.h	whereis search highlighting
USE_KEYMAPS		LYCurses.h	use of .lynx-keymaps files

D. Symbols defined locally to modify some behavior
==================================================
Defined in the source files to which they apply.  Only filenames are listed,
the files would have to be read and edited anyway to change the definition.
Normally installers shouldn't have to care about any of these symbols.

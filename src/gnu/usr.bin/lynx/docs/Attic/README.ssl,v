@SSL support for Lynx 2.8.4 (SSL-MM 1.4.1)
-- adapted from http://www.moxienet.com/lynx/

Lynx, in its unmodified form, will not allow you to make secure socket layer
(SSL) connections.  SSL is used for the secure transfer of information over the
Internet.  Many sites are now requiring SSL to ensure security for themselves
and their users.  With a version of Lynx modified to support SSL, Lynx users
can now visit these sites with ease as well.

The SSL configure option (--with-ssl) for Lynx provides the ability to make use
of SSL over HTTP for secure access to web sites (HTTPS) and over NNTP for
secure access to news servers (SNEWS).  SSL is handled transparently, allowing
users to continue accessing web sites and news services from within Lynx
through the same interface for both secure and standard transfers.

This is based on, and requires, the OpenSSL library.  OpenSSL's distribution
and use may be restricted by licenses and laws.  For information on obtaining
OpenSSL, as well as information on its distribution, see
http://www.openssl.org/.  The main distribution site is ftp://ftp.openssl.org/. 

To test your version of Lynx for its SSL support, try it out with an SSL site. 
http://www.moxienet.com/lynx/ssl-test will redirect you to a secure (https)
page which will load if your browser contains SSL support, and give you some
information about the connection.  Note that the server that you are redirected
to may not have a valid certificate.  Lynx will not complain, as it does not
yet support certificates, but other browsers may.  Since you will not be
sending any sensitive data to the test page, this should not present a problem.

It is the user's responsibility to ensure that all patent laws,
export restrictions, and other considerations have been taken into account
before using this software.

-- Note:

Lynx is GPL'd, so it falls under the regulations in EAR section
740.13(e)(1):

    (1) Encryption source code controlled under 5D002, which would be
        considered publicly available under section 734.3(b)(3) and
        which is not subject an express agreement for the payment a
        licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or sale of
        any product developed with the source code, is released from
        EI controls and may be exported or reexported without review
        under License Exception TSU, provided you have submitted
        written notification to BXA of the Internet location (e.g.,
        URL or Internet address) or a copy of source code by the time
        of export.

Lynx also has experimental support for GnuTLS (configure option --with-gnutls).
For information on GnuTLS, see

	http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/

To test your version of Lynx for SSL support, try it out with an SSL site.
Below are secure (https) pages which will load if your browser contains SSL
support and you accept their certificates; they give you some information about
the connection.

	https://www.gnutls.org:5555/
	https://www2.ggn.net/cgi-bin/ssl

Lynx will complain about the certificate, since the certificate presented is
untrusted.  You may accept this certificate to test your configuration, since
it is a test, but it is a bad idea to blindly accept certificates from unknown
websites if you are transmitting form data or files.

You should review the document README.sslcerts for a detailed discussion of
correct certificate handling possibilities and procedures in lynx.

Users are reminded to check the laws and regulations about encryption software
in their own countries.

Here is the URL for US notification rules:

Note that that isn't a typo; it really is "Nofify". The site contains
links to the full EAR regulations.

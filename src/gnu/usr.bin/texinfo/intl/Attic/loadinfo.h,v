/* Lookup a locale dependent file.
   *L10NFILE_LIST denotes a pool of lookup results of locale dependent
   files of the same kind, sorted in decreasing order of ->filename.
   DIRLIST and DIRLIST_LEN are an argz list of directories in which to
   look, containing at least one directory (i.e. DIRLIST_LEN > 0).
   MASK, LANGUAGE, TERRITORY, CODESET, NORMALIZED_CODESET, MODIFIER,
   SPECIAL, SPONSOR, REVISION are the pieces of the locale name, as
   produced by _nl_explode_name().  FILENAME is the filename suffix.
   The return value is the lookup result, either found in *L10NFILE_LIST,
   or - if DO_ALLOCATE is nonzero - freshly allocated, or possibly NULL.
   If the return value is non-NULL, it is added to *L10NFILE_LIST, and
   its ->next field denotes the chaining inside *L10NFILE_LIST, and
   furthermore its ->successor[] field contains a list of other lookup
   results from which this lookup result inherits.  */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/* Why do we care about stdout you may ask?  Here's why, from Jim
   Meyering in the lib/closeout.c file.  */

/* If a program writes *anything* to stdout, that program should close
   stdout and make sure that the close succeeds.  Otherwise, suppose that
   you go to the extreme of checking the return status of every function
   that does an explicit write to stdout.  The last printf can succeed in
   writing to the internal stream buffer, and yet the fclose(stdout) could
   still fail (due e.g., to a disk full error) when it tries to write
   out that buffered data.  Thus, you would be left with an incomplete
   output file and the offending program would exit successfully.

   Besides, it's wasteful to check the return value from every call
   that writes to stdout -- just let the internal stream state record
   the failure.  That's what the ferror test is checking below.

   It's important to detect such failures and exit nonzero because many
   tools (most notably `make' and other build-management systems) depend
   on being able to detect failure in other tools via their exit status.  */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

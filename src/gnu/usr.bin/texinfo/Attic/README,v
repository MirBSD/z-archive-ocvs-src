@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

This is the README file for the GNU Texinfo distribution.
The primary distribution point is ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/
and the primary home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/,
secondary home page at http://texinfo.org/.

Mailing lists:
- bug-texinfo@@gnu.org for bug reports or enhancement suggestions,
  archived at ftp://ftp-mailing-list-archives.gnu.org/bug-texinfo/.
- help-texinfo@@gnu.org for authoring questions and general discussion.

- texinfo-pretest@@texinfo.org for pretests of new releases,

There are as yet no corresponding newsgroups.

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- any unusual options you gave to configure (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

When sending email, please do not encode or split the messages in any
way if at all possible; it's easier to deal with one large message than
many small ones.  GNU shar is a convenient way of packaging multiple
and/or binary files for email.


For generic installation instructions on compiling and installing this
Automake-based distribution, please read the file `INSTALL'.
Installation notes specific to Texinfo:

* The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
  file in this distribution is included as a possible starting point.
  Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

* You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
  processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, you might like to use
  @@afourpaper by default.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
  texinfo.txi for more details.  You don't have to create the file if
  you have nothing to put in it.

* If your info files are not in $prefix/info, you may wish to add a line
#define DEFAULT_INFOPATH "/mydir1:/mydir2:..."
  to config.h after running configure.

* For instructions on compiling this distribution with DJGPP tools
  for MS-DOS and MS-Windows, see the file djgpp/README.


If you would like to contribute to the GNU project by implementing
additional documentation output formats for Texinfo, that would be
great.  But please do not write a separate translator texi2foo for your
favorite format foo!  That is the hard way to do the job, and makes
extra work in subsequent maintenance, since the Texinfo language is
continually being enhanced and updated.  Instead, the best approach is
modify Makeinfo to generate the new format, as it does now for Info,
HTML, XML, and DocBook.

If you want to convert from DocBook to Texinfo, please see 
http://docbook2X.sourceforge.net/.


This distribution includes the following files, among others:
    README                      This file.

    NEWS                        Summary of new features by release.

    INTRODUCTION                Brief introduction to the system, and
                                how to create readable files from the
                                Texinfo source files in this distribution.

Texinfo source files (in ./doc):
    texinfo.txi                 Describes the Texinfo language and many
                                of the associated tools.  It tells how
                                to use Texinfo to write documentation,
                                how to use Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs,
                                TeX, makeinfo, and the Emacs Lisp
                                Texinfo formatting commands.

    info.texi                   This manual tells you how to use 
                                Info.  This document comes as part of
                                GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs,
                                you can format this Texinfo source
                                file with makeinfo or TeX and then
                                read the resulting Info file with the
                                standalone Info reader that is part of
                                this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi              This manual tells you how to use
                                the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                                included in this distribution as C
                                source (./info).

Printing related files:
    doc/texinfo.tex             This TeX definitions file tells
                                the TeX program how to typeset a
                                Texinfo file into a DVI file ready for
                                printing.

    util/texindex.c             This file contains the source for
                                the `texindex' program that generates
                                sorted indices used by TeX when
                                typesetting a file for printing.

    util/texi2dvi               This is a shell script for
                                producing an indexed DVI file using
                                TeX and texindex. 


Source files for standalone C programs (./lib, ./makeinfo, ./info):

    makeinfo/makeinfo.c         This file contains the source for
                                the `makeinfo' program that you can
                                use to create an Info file from a
                                Texinfo file.

    info/info.c                 This file contains the source for
                                the `info' program that you can use to
                                view Info files on an ASCII terminal.

Installation files:
    configure                   This file creates creates a Makefile 
                                which in turn creates an `info' or
                                `makeinfo' executable, or a C sources
                                distribution.

    configure.in                This is a template for creating 
                                `configure' using Autoconf.

    Makefile.in                 This is a template for `configure' 
                                to use to make a Makefile.  Created by
                                Automake.
                               
    Makefile.am                 This is a template for Automake
                                to use to make a Makefile.in.
                               

Other files:
    fixfonts                    This is a shell script to install the 
                                `lcircle10' TeX fonts as an alias for
                                the `circle10' fonts.  In some older
                                TeX distributions the names are
                                different.

    tex3patch                   This handles a bug for version
                                3.0 of TeX that does not occur in
                                more recent versions.

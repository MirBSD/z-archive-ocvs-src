@* remove all GNU Automake files, we don't need them
* disable stupid "if Makefile.am isn't there, I can't build
  Makefile.in so I can't build Makefile so... huh?" stuff
* basically synch lists (base, not x11) with what is gained;
  more review needed
  XXX adjust notes
* various improvements I don't remember
* add configs from the FSF
  (with MirBSD and ekkoBSD support added by myself)
* update some FSF material
* plug some strcpy, strcat, sprintf, mktemp holes
* fix and unify the way where and how the gcc version subdirs are included

XXX someone string-"fix" roff and the gnu part (isdnd will be taken care of later)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

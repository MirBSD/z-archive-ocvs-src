@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

If you are interested in working on any of these, email bug-texinfo@@gnu.org.

* Makeinfo:
  - Try directory of main source file.
  - Support @@`{@@dotless{i}} et al. in HTML.
  - A detexinfo program, like detex or delatex.  This command would
    strip all the texinfo commands out, and would be used as a filter on
    the way to a speller.  An option would be to NOT strip comments out.
    makeinfo --no-headers comes close.
  - If node name contains an @@ command, complain explicitly.
  - Call Ghostscript to get ASCII/jpg output for the @@image command.
  - Better HTML output: allow settable background color, table colors
    and spacing, <head> meta tags, back link from footnote marker, etc.
  - Rewrite completely to simplify generation of different formats.

* TeX:
  - Use @@ as the escape character, and Texinfo syntax generally, in the
    table of contents, aux, and index files.  Eliminate all the crazy
    multiple redefinitions of every Texinfo command in different contexts.
  - Handle @@hsep and @@vsep in @@multitables.
  - Introduce new command to change \bindingoffset.
  - Reasonable way to change fonts from the default (some work has been
    done), to allow for PostScript fonts, for example.
  - How about using latex2html to produce HTML?
  - Support 8-bit input characters, perhaps via the ec fonts.
  - Repeat table headings if a @@multitable is multiple pages long.
  - Table of contents gets misaligned if there are 10 or more [sub]sections.

* General:
  - Rationalize and improve the dir categories in existing manuals.
  - @@xindexterm [def] primary [,secondary [,tertiary]]  or some such?
  - Support compressed image files.
  - Handle reference card creation, perhaps by only paying attention to
    sectioning and @@def... commands.
  - Allow @@end (and other?) commands to be indented in the source.
  - Get Info declared as a MIME Content-Type.

* Language:
  - @@figure:
@@figure [xref-label]
@@figureinclude <filename>, [<height>], [<width>]
@@figurehsize <dimen>
@@figurevsize <dimen>
@@caption ... @@end caption
<arbitrary Texinfo commands>
@@end figure
  - multicolumn * width to take up `the rest'.
  - another table command to take N succeeding items and split them
    into M columns (see eplain).
  - support bibliographies with BibTeX (see web2c/doc for kludge prototype).
  - @@flushboth to combine @@flushleft and @@flushright, for RFC's.
  - @@part sectioning command.
  - Allow subitems and `see' and `see also' in indices.
  - @@exercise/@@answer command for, e.g., gawk.
  - Allow @@hsep/@@vsep at @@item, instead of just in template.
  - Support automatic line numbering of examples.
  - Better macro syntax.
  - Allow : in node names for info files, for names like
    `class::method'.  Likewise index entries.  A quoting mechanism such
    as surrounding node names with SPACE BACKSPACE is probably the best
    solution, although this is an incompatible change to Info format, sigh.
  - Change bars.  This is difficult or impossible in TeX,
    unfortunately.  To do it right requires device driver support.
    wdiff or ediff may be all we can do.

* Doc:
  - Include a complete functional summary, as in a reference card, in
    the manual.
  - Improve the manuals, especially for makeinfo, standalone info, etc.
  - new section on doing dedication pages. See gawk.texi
    for an example of doing it in both the tex and info versions.

* Info:
  - Regular expression search.
  - Full-text search across all info files installed on the system.
  - Support character sets other than ISO Latin 1.
  - Perhaps comply with LANGUAGE setting on a per-node basis, to allow
    incremental translation of Texinfo files.
  - Search all nodes of dir file at startup, then can have
    INFO-DIR-SEPARATE-GROUPS and other such.
  - Better dir file merging.
  - Steal interface ideas from Lynx: number links, use color, etc.
    Perhaps code from the pinfo viewer can be reused:
    http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~pborys/.
  - More sample .infokey files, so people can choose without writing their own.
  - q within help should quit help like C-x 0.
  - Incorporate an X-based viewer, perhaps tkinfo
      http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~boldt/tkinfo/
    or saxinfo.

* PDF:
  - make each letter of the index (A, B, ...) a section in the TOC.
    From Carsten Dominik <dominik@@astro.uva.nl>.

  
* install-info:
  - be able to copy the info file to compile-time $(infodir), to
    simplify by-hand installation.


Ideas that will not be implemented:
- Process Texinfo files directly instead of converting to Info:
  ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/tkman.tar.Z, which
  uses Tcl/Tk 8.0 from ftp.smli.com in the /pub/tcl directory.
  From: phelps@@ecstasy.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Tom Phelps)
  [This has the disadvantage of needing to be updated when the
  Texinfo language changes, so don't.]

- Split HTML output by chapter.
  [Then cross-references in HTML cannot be generated consistently.]

  - Support installation of manuals in different languages, along these lines:
    . support a LINGUAS file or variable saying which subdirs LL in the
      source to descend into (under doc/).
    . within each subdir LL, install the info files into $infodir/LL,
      and run install-info on $infodir/LL/dir.
    . info (both emacs and standalone) should read $infodir/$LANG/dir
      as the first dir file, and likewise read info files first from
      $infodir/$LANG, before falling back to $infodir.
    . consider ways to avoid installing images in both places.
      In fact, images probably need to be installed in a subdir
      $infodir/MANUAL/ in the first place, to avoid conflicts of having
      the same image name in different manuals.
    For a test case, see texinfo cvs, with its one translated manual
    (info-fr.texi).
    From Wojciech Polak.
  - Monitor and improve the dir categories in existing manuals,
    following the Free Software Directory categories.  Much mail to
    developers has already been sent, what's needed now is to check new
    releases and make sure they are using the right categories.
    See the util/dir-example in the Texinfo distribution for our current
    recommended categories.
    For background, see the thread (which discusses a lot of other
    issues too) at

  - Get Info declared as a MIME Content-Type.
  - Likewise the `info:' URI scheme; a library consortium has proposed a
    completely different purpose for the URI scheme, but I don't know
    how to send comments, despite it being a "request for comments".  Sigh.

  - Glossary/general definition support (dumas msg 28 Nov 2003 17:09:57 +0100).
  - Add support for other Latin 9 (and Latin 2 and Latin 1) characters.

* Makeinfo:
  - Translation of "Appendix" etc. should depend on @@doclang not $LANG.
  - Try directory of main source file.
  - Make makeinfo -E just do macro expansion, avoiding all error checks.
    That way, texi2dvi could run makeinfo --iftex -E.
  - A detexinfo program, like detex or delatex.  This command would
    strip all the texinfo commands out, and would be used as a filter on
    the way to a speller.  An option would be to NOT strip comments out.
    makeinfo --no-headers comes close.
  - If node name contains an @@ command, complain explicitly.
  - Use @@documentlanguage instead of LANG for many translations.
  - HTML: split output by chapter to improve context, per Akim.
    Generate dummy files for all nodes for the sake of cross-references.
  - HTML: support thumbnails.
  - HTML: make images of math, maybe.
  - HTML: allow settable background color, table colors and spacing,
    <head> meta tags, etc.  A la http://texi2html.cvshome.org.  In fact:
  - HTML: have a library of different CSS styles.
    http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2004-01/msg00025.html
  - XML: cannot be loaded directly in a browser; why not?
  - Docbook: &euro; and other entities do not work; does anything work?
  - Rewrite completely to simplify generation of different formats.

* TeX:
  - Use @@ as the escape character, and Texinfo syntax generally, in the
    table of contents and index files.  Eliminate all the crazy
    multiple redefinitions of every Texinfo command in different contexts.
  - Support input in any encoding and language, via ec or Latin Modern fonts.
  - Reasonable way to change fonts from the default (some work has been
    done), to allow for PostScript fonts, for example.
  - @@multitable: handle @@hsep and @@vsep.
  - @@multitable: repeat table headings if multiple pages long.

  - Introduce new command to change \bindingoffset.
  - How about using latex2html to produce HTML?
  - Table of contents gets misaligned if there are 10 or more [sub]sections.
  - Use url.sty (or something) to allow linebreak of url's.

  - merge features with Debian install-info, so we can have one program.

* texindex:
  - read source file (specified by new option) for @@documentlanguage
    and/or @@documentencoding, and change the sorting appropriately.
  From: Wojciech Polak, 26 Apr 2003 11:30:59 +0200.

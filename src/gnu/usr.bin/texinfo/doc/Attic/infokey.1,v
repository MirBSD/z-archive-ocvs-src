@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

.Sh NAME
.Nm infokey
.Nd compile custom key bindings file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm infokey
.Op Fl -help
.Op Fl -version
.Op Fl -output Ar file
.Op Ar input file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility compiles a source file
.Po Pa $HOME/.infokey
 by default
.Pc
containing
.Xr info 1
customizations into a binary format
.Po Pa $HOME/.info
 by default
.Pc . 
.Xr info 1
reads the binary file at startup to override the
default key bindings and variable definitions.
.Pp
Besides the standard
.Fl -help
and
.Fl -version
options, the only option is
.Fl -output Ar file .
This tells
.Nm infokey
to write the binary data to
.Ar file
instead of
.Pa $HOME/.info .
.Pp
The format of the source file read by
.Nm
is most easily illustrated by example.
For instance, here is a sample
.Pa .infokey
source file suitable for aficionados of
.Xr vi 1
or
.Xr less 1 :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#info
j       next-line
k       prev-line
l       forward-char
h       backward-char
\\kd     next-line
\\ku     prev-line
\\kr     forward-char
\\kl     backward-char
\\       scroll-forward
\\kD     scroll-forward-page-only
b       scroll-backward
\\kU     scroll-backward-page-only
g       beginning-of-node
\\kh     beginning-of-node
G       end-of-node
\\ke     end-of-node
\\t      select-reference-this-line
-       history-node
n       next-node
p       prev-node
u       up-node
t       top-node
d       dir-node
#var
scroll-step=1
.Ed
.Pp
The source file consists of one or more "sections".
Each section starts with a line that identifies the type of section.
Possible sections are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It #info
Key bindings for
.Xr info 1
windows.
The start of this section is indicated by a line containing just `#info'
by itself.
If this is the first section in the source file,
the `#info' line can be omitted.
The rest of this section consists of lines of the form:

    STRING whitespace ACTION [ whitespace [ # comment ] ] newline

Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs.
Comment is any sequence of any characters, excluding newline.
.Pp
STRING is the key sequence which invokes the action.
ACTION is the name of an
.Xr info 1
command.
The characters in STRING are interpreted literally or prefixed by a
caret (`^') to indicate a control character.
A backslash followed by certain characters specifies input keystrokes
as follows:
.Pp    
`\\b'	Backspace
.Pp
`\\e'	Escape (ESC)
.Pp
`\\n'	Newline
.Pp
`\\r'	Return
.Pp
`\\t'	Tab
.Pp
`\\ku'	Up arrow
.Pp
`\\kd'	Down arrow
.Pp
`\\kl'	Left arrow
.Pp
`\\kr'	Right arrow
.Pp
`\\kU'	Page Up
.Pp
`\\kD'	Page Down
.Pp
`\\kh'	HOME
.Pp
`\\ke'	END
.Pp
`\\kx'	Delete (DEL)
.Pp
`\\mX'	Meta-X where X is any character as described above.
.Pp
Backslash followed by any other character indicates that character
is to be taken literally.
Characters which must be preceded by a backslash include
caret, space, tab, and backslash itself.
.Pp
.It #echo-area
Key bindings for the echo area.
The start of this section is indicated by a line containing just
`#echo-area' by itself.
The rest of this section has a syntax identical to that for the key
definitions for the
.Xr info 1
area, described above.
.Pp
.It #var
Variable initializations.
The start of this section is indicated by a line containing just `#var'
by itself.
Following this line is a list of variable assignments, one per line.
Each line consists of a variable name followed by `=',
followed by a value.
There may be no whitespace between the variable name and the `=',
and all characters following the `=',
including whitespace, are included in the value.
.El
.Pp
Blank lines and lines starting with `#' are ignored, except for the
special section header lines.
.Pp
Key bindings defined in the
.Pa .info
file take precedence over info's default key bindings, whether or not
.Cm --vi-keys
is used.
A default key binding may be disabled by overriding it in the
.Pa .info
file with the action `invalid'.
In addition,
.Em all
default key bindings can be disabled by adding this line
.Em anywhere
in the relevant section:
.Pp
     #stop
.Pp
This will cause
.Xr info 1
to ignore all the default key commands for that section.
.Pp
.Sy Beware :
`#stop' can be dangerous.
Since it disables all default key bindings, you must supply enough new
key bindings to enable all necessary actions.
Failure to bind any key to the `quit' command, for example,
can lead to frustration.
.Pp
The order in which key bindings are defined in the
.Pa .info
file is not important, except that the command summary produced by the
`get-help-window' command only displays the
.Em first
key that is bound to each command.
.Sh FILES
$HOME/.infokey		Default souce file for customizations.
$HOME/.info		Default binary file for customizations.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

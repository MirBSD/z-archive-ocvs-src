@Mike Haertel wrote the main program and the dfa and kwset matchers.

Arthur David Olson contributed the heuristics for finding fixed substrings
at the end of dfa.c.

Richard Stallman and Karl Berry wrote the regex backtracking matcher.

Henry Spencer wrote the original test suite from which grep's was derived.

Scott Anderson invented the Khadafy test.

David MacKenzie wrote the automatic configuration software use to
produce the configure script.

Authors of the replacements for standard library routines are identified
in the corresponding source files.

The idea of using Boyer-Moore type algorithms to quickly filter out
non-matching text before calling the regexp matcher was originally due
to James Woods.  He also contributed some code to early versions of
GNU grep.

Mike Haertel would like to thank Andrew Hume for many fascinating discussions
of string searching issues over the years.  Hume & Sunday's excellent
paper on fast string searching (AT&T Bell Laboratories CSTR #156)
describes some of the history of the subject, as well as providing
exhaustive performance analysis of various implementation alternatives.
The inner loop of GNU grep is similar to Hume & Sunday's recommended
"Tuned Boyer Moore" inner loop.

More work was done on regex.[ch] by Ulrich Drepper and Arnold
Robbins. Regex is now part of GNU C library, see this package
for complete details and credits.

Arnold Robbins contributed to improve dfa.[ch]. In fact
it came straight from gawk-3.0.3 with small editing and fixes.

Many folks contributed see THANKS, if I omited someone please
send me email.

Alain Magloire is the current maintainer.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

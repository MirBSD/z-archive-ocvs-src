@the most crude hack I ever made...

mkisofs from cdrtools-2.01a19.tar.bz2

TODO:
* nuke use of character 0x60 from CVS (!)
* nuke NLS
* have this... *thing* use libc actually for things
  such as printf(), and not make its own *shudder*
* shrink
* verify it works
* send out an extermination mission to the author

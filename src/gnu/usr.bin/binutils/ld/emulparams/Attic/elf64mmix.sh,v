# The existence of a symbol __start (or _start) should overrule Main, so

# also want to provide Main as a synonym for _start, if Main wasn't
# defined but is referred to, and _start was defined.
#
# The reason we use a symbol "_start." as a mediator is to avoid
# causing ld to force the type of _start to object rather than no
# type, which confuses disassembly; we also make it alphanumerically
# a successor of _start for similar reasons.  Perhaps it's a linker
# bug that linker-defined symbols set the symbol-type.
#
# Note that we smuggle this into OTHER_TEXT_SECTIONS (at the end
# of .text) rather than TEXT_START_SYMBOLS.  This is necessary, as
# DEFINED wouldn't find the symbol if it was at the top; presumably
# before the definition, if the definition is not in the first file.
# FIXME: Arguably a linker bug.

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

# A dynamic reloc for an undefined weak reference in a program got a
# confused symbol reference count mismatch with a bfd assertion.  Linking
# with a DSO was needed as a catalyst to get to the faulty code; nothing
# in the DSO was needed.  We just check that we don't get the bfd
# assertion.  Note that no actual dynamic reloc is created for the
# unresolved weak.  Perhaps it should; the symbol could be defined in a
# preloaded object or a new version of the DSO.  FIXME: Revisit and adjust
# test-result.

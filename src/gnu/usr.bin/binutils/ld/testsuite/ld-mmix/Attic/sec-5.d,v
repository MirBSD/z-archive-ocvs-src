@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

# Check that sections are automatically created to cope with contents at
# unexpected addresses.  We do this by linking .text at an unexpected
# address.  As .text (like .data) does not get a section descriptor, the
# output gets a LOP_LOC at an unexpected address, and a unique section is
# created.  This test will have to be changed if .text gets a section
# descriptor if linked to an unexpected address.

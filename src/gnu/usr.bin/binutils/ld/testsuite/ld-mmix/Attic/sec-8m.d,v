@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

# Distantly related to sec-7m.s in that section lengths mattered for the
# bug.  When one input-section (seen in mmo.c as a chunk of data to
# output) had a length not a multiple of four, the last bytes were saved
# to be concatenated with the next chunk.  If it was followed by a chunk
# with a leading multiple-of-four number of zero bytes, those zero bytes
# would be omitted, and the "saved" bytes would be concatenated with the
# following (not-all-zeros) bytes.  Hence a shift of the last bytes of the
# first chunk.  Note that the section will be padded in the output.

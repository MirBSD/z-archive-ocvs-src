	2. The table of contents is placed immediately after idata4.
	   The ".private.toc" sections are generated by the ppc bfd. The
	   .toc variable is generated by gas, and resolved here. It is
	   used to initialized function descriptors (and anyone else who
	   needs the address of the module's toc). The only thing 
	   interesting about it at all? Most ppc instructions using it
	   have a 16bit displacement field. The convention for addressing
	   is to initialize the .toc value to 32K past the start of the
	   actual toc, and subtract 32K from all references, thus using

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

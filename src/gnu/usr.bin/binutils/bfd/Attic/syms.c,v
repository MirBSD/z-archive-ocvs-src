SECTION
	Symbols

	BFD tries to maintain as much symbol information as it can when
	it moves information from file to file. BFD passes information
	to applications though the <<asymbol>> structure. When the
	application requests the symbol table, BFD reads the table in
	the native form and translates parts of it into the internal
	format. To maintain more than the information passed to
	applications, some targets keep some information ``behind the
	scenes'' in a structure only the particular back end knows
	about. For example, the coff back end keeps the original
	symbol table structure as well as the canonical structure when
	a BFD is read in. On output, the coff back end can reconstruct
	the output symbol table so that no information is lost, even
	information unique to coff which BFD doesn't know or
	understand. If a coff symbol table were read, but were written
	through an a.out back end, all the coff specific information
	would be lost. The symbol table of a BFD
	is not necessarily read in until a canonicalize request is
	made. Then the BFD back end fills in a table provided by the
	application with pointers to the canonical information.  To
	output symbols, the application provides BFD with a table of
	pointers to pointers to <<asymbol>>s. This allows applications
	like the linker to output a symbol as it was read, since the ``behind
	the scenes'' information will be still available.

INODE
Reading Symbols, Writing Symbols, Symbols, Symbols
SUBSECTION
	Reading symbols

	There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD:
	allocating storage, and the actual reading process. This is an
	excerpt from an application which reads the symbol table:

|	  long storage_needed;
|	  asymbol **symbol_table;
|	  long number_of_symbols;
|	  long i;
|
|	  storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);
|
|         if (storage_needed < 0)
|           FAIL
|
|	  if (storage_needed == 0)
|	    return;
|	  
|	  symbol_table = (asymbol **) xmalloc (storage_needed);
|	    ...
|	  number_of_symbols =
|	     bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table);
|
|         if (number_of_symbols < 0)
|           FAIL
|
|	  for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++)
|	    process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);

	All storage for the symbols themselves is in an objalloc
	connected to the BFD; it is freed when the BFD is closed.

INODE
Writing Symbols, Mini Symbols, Reading Symbols, Symbols
SUBSECTION
	Writing symbols

	Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for
	writing is closed. The application attaches a vector of
	pointers to pointers to symbols to the BFD being written, and
	fills in the symbol count. The close and cleanup code reads
	through the table provided and performs all the necessary
	operations. The BFD output code must always be provided with an
	``owned'' symbol: one which has come from another BFD, or one
	which has been created using <<bfd_make_empty_symbol>>.  Here is an
	example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one element:

|	#include "bfd.h"
|	int main (void)
|	{
|	  bfd *abfd;
|	  asymbol *ptrs[2];
|	  asymbol *new;
|
|	  abfd = bfd_openw ("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
|	  bfd_set_format (abfd, bfd_object);
|	  new = bfd_make_empty_symbol (abfd);
|	  new->name = "dummy_symbol";
|	  new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way (abfd, ".text");
|	  new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
|	  new->value = 0x12345;
|
|	  ptrs[0] = new;
|	  ptrs[1] = (asymbol *)0;
|
|	  bfd_set_symtab (abfd, ptrs, 1);
|	  bfd_close (abfd);
|	  return 0;
|	}
|
|	./makesym
|	nm foo
|	00012345 A dummy_symbol

	Many formats cannot represent arbitary symbol information; for
 	instance, the <<a.out>> object format does not allow an
	arbitary number of sections. A symbol pointing to a section
	which is not one  of <<.text>>, <<.data>> or <<.bss>> cannot
	be described.

INODE
Mini Symbols, typedef asymbol, Writing Symbols, Symbols
SUBSECTION
	Mini Symbols

	Mini symbols provide read-only access to the symbol table.
	They use less memory space, but require more time to access.
	They can be useful for tools like nm or objdump, which may
	have to handle symbol tables of extremely large executables.

	The <<bfd_read_minisymbols>> function will read the symbols
	into memory in an internal form.  It will return a <<void *>>
	pointer to a block of memory, a symbol count, and the size of
	each symbol.  The pointer is allocated using <<malloc>>, and
	should be freed by the caller when it is no longer needed.

	The function <<bfd_minisymbol_to_symbol>> will take a pointer
	to a minisymbol, and a pointer to a structure returned by
	<<bfd_make_empty_symbol>>, and return a <<asymbol>> structure.
	The return value may or may not be the same as the value from
	<<bfd_make_empty_symbol>> which was passed in.

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

FUNCTION

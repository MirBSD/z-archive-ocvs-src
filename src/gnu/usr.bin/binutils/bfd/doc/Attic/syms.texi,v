@@@section Symbols
BFD tries to maintain as much symbol information as it can when
it moves information from file to file. BFD passes information
to applications though the @@code{asymbol} structure. When the
application requests the symbol table, BFD reads the table in
the native form and translates parts of it into the internal
format. To maintain more than the information passed to
applications, some targets keep some information ``behind the
scenes'' in a structure only the particular back end knows
about. For example, the coff back end keeps the original
symbol table structure as well as the canonical structure when
a BFD is read in. On output, the coff back end can reconstruct
the output symbol table so that no information is lost, even
information unique to coff which BFD doesn't know or
understand. If a coff symbol table were read, but were written
through an a.out back end, all the coff specific information
would be lost. The symbol table of a BFD
is not necessarily read in until a canonicalize request is
made. Then the BFD back end fills in a table provided by the
application with pointers to the canonical information.  To
output symbols, the application provides BFD with a table of
pointers to pointers to @@code{asymbol}s. This allows applications
like the linker to output a symbol as it was read, since the ``behind
the scenes'' information will be still available.

@@subsection Reading symbols
There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD:
allocating storage, and the actual reading process. This is an
excerpt from an application which reads the symbol table:

@@example
         long storage_needed;
         asymbol **symbol_table;
         long number_of_symbols;
         long i;

         storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);

         if (storage_needed < 0)
           FAIL

         if (storage_needed == 0)
           return;
         
         symbol_table = (asymbol **) xmalloc (storage_needed);
           ...
         number_of_symbols =
            bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table);

         if (number_of_symbols < 0)
           FAIL

         for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++)
           process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);
@@end example

All storage for the symbols themselves is in an objalloc
connected to the BFD; it is freed when the BFD is closed.

@@node Writing Symbols, Mini Symbols, Reading Symbols, Symbols
@@subsection Writing symbols
Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for
writing is closed. The application attaches a vector of
pointers to pointers to symbols to the BFD being written, and
fills in the symbol count. The close and cleanup code reads
through the table provided and performs all the necessary
operations. The BFD output code must always be provided with an
``owned'' symbol: one which has come from another BFD, or one
which has been created using @@code{bfd_make_empty_symbol}.  Here is an
example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one element:

@@example
       #include "bfd.h"
       int main (void)
       @@{
         bfd *abfd;
         asymbol *ptrs[2];
         asymbol *new;

         abfd = bfd_openw ("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
         bfd_set_format (abfd, bfd_object);
         new = bfd_make_empty_symbol (abfd);
         new->name = "dummy_symbol";
         new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way (abfd, ".text");
         new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
         new->value = 0x12345;

         ptrs[0] = new;
         ptrs[1] = (asymbol *)0;

         bfd_set_symtab (abfd, ptrs, 1);
         bfd_close (abfd);
         return 0;
       @@}

       ./makesym
       nm foo
       00012345 A dummy_symbol
@@end example

Many formats cannot represent arbitary symbol information; for
instance, the @@code{a.out} object format does not allow an
arbitary number of sections. A symbol pointing to a section
which is not one  of @@code{.text}, @@code{.data} or @@code{.bss} cannot
be described.

@@node Mini Symbols, typedef asymbol, Writing Symbols, Symbols
@@subsection Mini Symbols
Mini symbols provide read-only access to the symbol table.
They use less memory space, but require more time to access.
They can be useful for tools like nm or objdump, which may
have to handle symbol tables of extremely large executables.

The @@code{bfd_read_minisymbols} function will read the symbols
into memory in an internal form.  It will return a @@code{void *}
pointer to a block of memory, a symbol count, and the size of
each symbol.  The pointer is allocated using @@code{malloc}, and
should be freed by the caller when it is no longer needed.

The function @@code{bfd_minisymbol_to_symbol} will take a pointer
to a minisymbol, and a pointer to a structure returned by
@@code{bfd_make_empty_symbol}, and return a @@code{asymbol} structure.
The return value may or may not be the same as the value from
@@code{bfd_make_empty_symbol} which was passed in.

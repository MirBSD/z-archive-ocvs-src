@@@section Sections
The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the
section abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of
sections.  It keeps hold of them by pointing to the first;
each one points to the next in the list.

Sections are supported in BFD in @@code{section.c}.

* section prototypes::
@@end menu

@@node Section Input, Section Output, Sections, Sections
@@subsection Section input
When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are
created and attached to the BFD.

Each section has a name which describes the section in the
outside world---for example, @@code{a.out} would contain at least
three sections, called @@code{.text}, @@code{.data} and @@code{.bss}.

Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
sections named @@code{.data}.

Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the ``natural'' number of
sections. A back end may attach other sections containing
constructor data, or an application may add a section (using
@@code{bfd_make_section}) to the sections attached to an already open
BFD. For example, the linker creates an extra section
@@code{COMMON} for each input file's BFD to hold information about
common storage.

The raw data is not necessarily read in when
the section descriptor is created. Some targets may leave the
data in place until a @@code{bfd_get_section_contents} call is
made. Other back ends may read in all the data at once.  For
example, an S-record file has to be read once to determine the
size of the data. An IEEE-695 file doesn't contain raw data in
sections, but data and relocation expressions intermixed, so
the data area has to be parsed to get out the data and
relocations.

@@node Section Output, typedef asection, Section Input, Sections
@@subsection Section output
To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be
written have to be created. They are attached to the BFD in
the same way as input sections; data is written to the
sections using @@code{bfd_set_section_contents}.

Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler
and linker) must use the @@code{asection} fields @@code{output_section} and
@@code{output_offset} to indicate the file sections to which each
section must be written.  (If the section is being created from
scratch, @@code{output_section} should probably point to the section
itself and @@code{output_offset} should probably be zero.)

The data to be written comes from input sections attached
(via @@code{output_section} pointers) to
the output sections.  The output section structure can be
considered a filter for the input section: the output section
determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the
input section determines the offset into the output section of
the data to be written.

E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long,
containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma
0x100) and "B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at vma 0x120) the @@code{asection}
structures would look like:

@@example
   section name          "A"
     output_offset   0x00
     size            0x20
     output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
                             |    vma             0x100
   section name          "B" |    size            0x123
     output_offset   0x20    |
     size            0x103   |
     output_section  --------|
@@end example

@@subsection Link orders
The data within a section is stored in a @@dfn{link_order}.
These are much like the fixups in @@code{gas}.  The link_order
abstraction allows a section to grow and shrink within itself.

A link_order knows how big it is, and which is the next
link_order and where the raw data for it is; it also points to
a list of relocations which apply to it.

The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on
final code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as
necessary to make it work without relaxing, and the user can
select whether to relax.  Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of
time.  The linker runs around the relocations to see if any
are attached to data which can be shrunk, if so it does it on
a link_order by link_order basis.

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

@@strong{Description}@@*
Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file
associated with BFD @@var{abfd}.

The initial motivation for, and use of, this routine is not
so we can get the exact size of the object the BFD applies to, since
that might not be generally possible (archive members for example).
It would be ideal if someone could eventually modify
it so that such results were guaranteed.

Instead, we want to ask questions like "is this NNN byte sized
object I'm about to try read from file offset YYY reasonable?"
As as example of where we might do this, some object formats
use string tables for which the first @@code{sizeof (long)} bytes of the
table contain the size of the table itself, including the size bytes.
If an application tries to read what it thinks is one of these
string tables, without some way to validate the size, and for
some reason the size is wrong (byte swapping error, wrong location
for the string table, etc.), the only clue is likely to be a read
error when it tries to read the table, or a "virtual memory
exhausted" error when it tries to allocate 15 bazillon bytes
of space for the 15 bazillon byte table it is about to read.
This function at least allows us to answer the quesion, "is the
size reasonable?".

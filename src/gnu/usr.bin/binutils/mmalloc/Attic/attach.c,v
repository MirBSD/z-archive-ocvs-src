/* Initialize access to a mmalloc managed region.

   If FD is a valid file descriptor for an open file then data for the
   mmalloc managed region is mapped to that file, otherwise "/dev/zero"
   is used and the data will not exist in any filesystem object.

   If the open file corresponding to FD is from a previous use of
   mmalloc and passes some basic sanity checks to ensure that it is
   compatible with the current mmalloc package, then it's data is
   mapped in and is immediately accessible at the same addresses in
   the current process as the process that created the file.

   If BASEADDR is not NULL, the mapping is established starting at the
   specified address in the process address space.  If BASEADDR is NULL,
   the mmalloc package chooses a suitable address at which to start the
   mapped region, which will be the value of the previous mapping if
   opening an existing file which was previously built by mmalloc, or
   for new files will be a value chosen by mmap.

   Specifying BASEADDR provides more control over where the regions
   start and how big they can be before bumping into existing mapped
   regions or future mapped regions.

   On success, returns a "malloc descriptor" which is used in subsequent
   calls to other mmalloc package functions.  It is explicitly "void *"
   ("char *" for systems that don't fully support void) so that users
   of the package don't have to worry about the actual implementation
   details.

   On failure returns NULL. */

   Note that we have to update the file descriptor number in the malloc-
   descriptor read from the file to match the current valid one, before
   trying to map the file in, and again after a successful mapping and
   after we've switched over to using the mapped in malloc descriptor 
   rather than the temporary one on the stack.

   Once we've switched over to using the mapped in malloc descriptor, we
   have to update the pointer to the morecore function, since it almost
   certainly will be at a different address if the process reusing the
   mapped region is from a different executable.

   Also note that if the heap being remapped previously used the mmcheckf()
   routines, we need to update the hooks since their target functions
   will have certainly moved if the executable has changed in any way.
   We do this by calling mmcheckf() internally.

   unsuccessful for some reason. */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

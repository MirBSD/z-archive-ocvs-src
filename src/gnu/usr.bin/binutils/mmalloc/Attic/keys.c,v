/* This module provides access to some keys that the application can use to
   provide persistent access to locations in the mapped memory section.
   The intent is that these keys are to be used sparingly as sort of
   persistent global variables which the application can use to reinitialize
   access to data in the mapped region.

   For the moment, these keys are simply stored in the malloc descriptor
   itself, in an array of fixed length.  This should be fixed so that there
   can be an unlimited number of keys, possibly using a multilevel access
   scheme of some sort. */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

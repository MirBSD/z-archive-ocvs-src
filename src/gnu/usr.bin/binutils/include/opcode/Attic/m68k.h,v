/* Kinds of operands:
   Characters used: AaBCcDdEFfGHIJkLlMmnOopQqRrSsTtU VvWXYZ0123|*~%;@@!&$?/<>#^+-

   D  data register only.  Stored as 3 bits.
   A  address register only.  Stored as 3 bits.
   a  address register indirect only.  Stored as 3 bits.
   R  either kind of register.  Stored as 4 bits.
   r  either kind of register indirect only.  Stored as 4 bits.
      At the moment, used only for cas2 instruction.
   F  floating point coprocessor register only.   Stored as 3 bits.
   O  an offset (or width): immediate data 0-31 or data register.
      Stored as 6 bits in special format for BF... insns.
   +  autoincrement only.  Stored as 3 bits (number of the address register).
   -  autodecrement only.  Stored as 3 bits (number of the address register).
   Q  quick immediate data.  Stored as 3 bits.
      This matches an immediate operand only when value is in range 1 .. 8.
   M  moveq immediate data.  Stored as 8 bits.
      This matches an immediate operand only when value is in range -128..127
   T  trap vector immediate data.  Stored as 4 bits.

   k  K-factor for fmove.p instruction.   Stored as a 7-bit constant or
      a three bit register offset, depending on the field type.

   #  immediate data.  Stored in special places (b, w or l)
      which say how many bits to store.
   ^  immediate data for floating point instructions.   Special places
      are offset by 2 bytes from '#'...
   B  pc-relative address, converted to an offset
      that is treated as immediate data.
   d  displacement and register.  Stores the register as 3 bits
      and stores the displacement in the entire second word.

   C  the CCR.  No need to store it; this is just for filtering validity.
   S  the SR.  No need to store, just as with CCR.
   U  the USP.  No need to store, just as with CCR.
   E  the ACC.  No need to store, just as with CCR.
   G  the MACSR.  No need to store, just as with CCR.
   H  the MASK.  No need to store, just as with CCR.

   I  Coprocessor ID.   Not printed if 1.   The Coprocessor ID is always
      extracted from the 'd' field of word one, which means that an extended
      coprocessor opcode can be skipped using the 'i' place, if needed.

   s  System Control register for the floating point coprocessor.

   J  Misc register for movec instruction, stored in 'j' format.

    L  Register list of the type d0-d7/a0-a7 etc.
       (New!  Improved!  Can also hold fp0-fp7, as well!)
       The assembler tries to see if the registers match the insn by
       looking at where the insn wants them stored.

    l  Register list like L, but with all the bits reversed.
       Used for going the other way. . .

    c  cache identifier which may be "nc" for no cache, "ic"
       for instruction cache, "dc" for data cache, or "bc"
       for both caches.  Used in cinv and cpush.  Always
       stored in position "d".

    u  Any register, with ``upper'' or ``lower'' specification.  Used
       in the mac instructions with size word.

 The remainder are all stored as 6 bits using an address mode and a
 register number; they differ in which addressing modes they match.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

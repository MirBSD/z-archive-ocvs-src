/* All i80960 development is done in a CROSS-DEVELOPMENT environment.  I.e.,
   object code is generated on, and executed under the direction of a symbolic
   debugger running on, a host system.  We do not want to be subject to the
   vagaries of which host it is or whether it supports COFF or a.out format,
   or anything else.  We DO want to:
  
  	o always generate the same format object files, regardless of host.
 
 	o have an 'a.out' header that we can modify for our own purposes
 	  (the 80960 is typically an embedded processor and may require
 	  enhanced linker support that the normal a.out.h header can't
 	  accommodate).
 
  As for byte-ordering, the following rules apply:
 
 	o Text and data that is actually downloaded to the target is always
 	  in i80960 (little-endian) order.
 
 	o All other numbers (in the header, symbols, relocation directives)
 	  are in host byte-order:  object files CANNOT be lifted from a
 	  little-end host and used on a big-endian (or vice versa) without
 	  modification.
  ==> THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE USING BFD.  WE CAN GENERATE ANY BYTE ORDER
      FOR THE HEADER, AND READ ANY BYTE ORDER.  PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO
      USE LITTLE-ENDIAN BYTE ORDER THROUGHOUT, REGARDLESS OF HOST.  <==
 
 	o The downloader ('comm960') takes care to generate a pseudo-header
 	  with correct (i80960) byte-ordering before shipping text and data
 	  off to the NINDY monitor in the target systems.  Symbols and
 	  relocation info are never sent to the target.  */

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

  If non-zero, the 'n_other' fields indicates either a leaf procedure or
  a system procedure, as follows:
 
 	1 <= n_other <= 32 :
 		The symbol is the entry point to a system procedure.
 		'n_value' is the address of the entry, as for any other
 		procedure.  The system procedure number (which can be used in
 		a 'calls' instruction) is (n_other-1).  These entries come from
 		'.sysproc' directives.
 
 	n_other == N_CALLNAME
 		the symbol is the 'call' entry point to a leaf procedure.
 		The *next* symbol in the symbol table must be the corresponding
 		'bal' entry point to the procedure (see following).  These
 		entries come from '.leafproc' directives in which two different
 		symbols are specified (the first one is represented here).
 	
 
 	n_other == N_BALNAME
 		the symbol is the 'bal' entry point to a leaf procedure.
 		These entries result from '.leafproc' directives in which only
 		one symbol is specified, or in which the same symbol is
 		specified twice.
 
  Note that an N_CALLNAME entry *must* have a corresponding N_BALNAME entry,
  but not every N_BALNAME entry must have an N_CALLNAME entry.  */

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

/* This interface isn't intended to be specific to any particular kind

/* There are various ways to handle system calls:

   1) Have a simulator intercept the appropriate trap instruction and
   directly perform the system call on behalf of the target program.
   This is the typical way of handling system calls for embedded targets.
   [Handling system calls for embedded targets isn't that much of an
   oxymoron as running compiler testsuites make use of the capability.]

   This method of system call handling is done when STATE_ENVIRONMENT
   is ENVIRONMENT_USER.

   2) Have a simulator emulate the hardware as much as possible.
   If the program running on the real hardware communicates with some sort
   of target manager, one would want to be able to run this program on the
   simulator as well.

   This method of system call handling is done when STATE_ENVIRONMENT
   is ENVIRONMENT_OPERATING.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/* This package implements a partition of consecutive integers.  The
   elements are partitioned into classes.  Each class is represented
   by one of its elements, the canonical element, which is chosen
   arbitrarily from elements in the class.  The principal operations
   on a partition are FIND, which takes an element, determines its
   class, and returns the canonical element for that class, and UNION,
   which unites the two classes that contain two given elements into a
   single class.

   The list implementation used here provides constant-time finds.  By
   storing the size of each class with the class's canonical element,
   it is able to perform unions over all the classes in the partition
   in O (N log N) time.  */

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

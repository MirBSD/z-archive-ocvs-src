@now it builds with -Werror, has its includes synched with these
of the in-tree libiberty, and all directories are correctly
configured. Also, installed executables are now stripped.

Yay! :)

/* These routines allocate space for an object.  The assumption is
   that the object will want to allocate space as it goes along, but
   will never want to free any particular block.  There is a function
   to free a block, which also frees all more recently allocated
   blocks.  There is also a function to free all the allocated space.

   This is essentially a specialization of obstacks.  The main
   difference is that a block may not be allocated a bit at a time.
   Another difference is that these routines are always built on top
   of malloc, and always pass an malloc failure back to the caller,
   unlike more recent versions of obstacks.  */

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

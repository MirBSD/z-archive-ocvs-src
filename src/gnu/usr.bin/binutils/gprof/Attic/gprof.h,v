@looks as if some sour wine (Federweißer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

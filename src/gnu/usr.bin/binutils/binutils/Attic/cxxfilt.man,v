@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

.SH DESCRIPTION
The C++ language provides function overloading, which means that you can
write many functions with the same name (providing each takes parameters
of different types).  All C++ function names are encoded into a
low-level assembly label (this process is known as
.I mangling\c
).  The 
.B @@PROGRAM@@
program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (\fIdemangles\fR)
low-level names into user-level names so that the linker can keep
these overloaded functions from clashing.
.PP
Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,
dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential label.  If the
label decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-level
name in the output.
.PP
You can use
.B @@PROGRAM@@
to decipher individual symbols by specifying these symbols on the
command line.
.PP
If no
.B symbol
arguments are given,
.B @@PROGRAM@@
reads symbol names from the standard input and writes the demangled
names to the standard output.  All results are printed on the standard
output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-_
.TP
.B \-\-strip\-underscores
On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an
underscore in front of every name.  For example, the C name 
.B foo
gets the low-level name 
.BR _foo .
This option removes the leading underscore.

.TP
.B "\-s {gnu,lucid,arm,hp,edg}"
.TP
.B \-\-format={gnu,lucid,arm,hp,edg}

.B nm
can decode five different methods of mangling, used by different C++
compilers.  This option selects which method it uses: the one used by
the GNU compiler, the one used by the Lucid compiler, the one
specified by the C++ Annotated Reference Manual, the one used by the HP
compiler and the one used by the EDG compiler.  The default is the
GNU style.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIXÆ, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

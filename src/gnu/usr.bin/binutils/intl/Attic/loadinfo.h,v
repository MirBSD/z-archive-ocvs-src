@<insider>This is the proof that there are strange attractors
in my brain, scientists report.</insider>

mop up after much-stuff-removal, regenerate configure files
using new ports/devel/autoconf/2.13 and have fun (well, you
can't have much fun with GNU tools, but, "optimizing" them,
certainly can be fun)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

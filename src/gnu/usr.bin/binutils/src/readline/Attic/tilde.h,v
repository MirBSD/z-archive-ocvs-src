@libedit:
* fix editline to behave like manpage states: try $PWD/.editrc
  before looking at $HOME/.editrc
* use $HOME/.etc/editrc instead of $HOME/.editrc
* <sys/cdefs.h>ify headers
* fix building of test
* simplify installation of headers
* beautify Makefile
* nuke dead trees

libreadline:
* remove

libedit:
* install libreadline wrapper headers to /usr/include/readline again
* take over

tested with a make build NOMAN=1^Hyes

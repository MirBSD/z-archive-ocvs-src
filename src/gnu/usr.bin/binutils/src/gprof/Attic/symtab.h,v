@* gprof: I don't know; I think gprof is pointless (since I don't write
  hooks for profiling libraries into gcc3, nor do we build these since
  years), but let's keep it here - the BSD version, not the GNU versi-
  on, and with unused arches deleted
* oldrdist: u-uh, deserves to die
* rdist, rdistd, sup: I don't think anybody would use them willingly;
  if so, please tell me (and I hope you've got a very good reason to
  do so ;-)
* learn: it was nice as a document of UNIX(R) history, but I'm cleaning
  up base right now, so...

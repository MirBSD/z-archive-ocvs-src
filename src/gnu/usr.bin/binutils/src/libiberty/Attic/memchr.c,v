@@deftypefn Supplemental void* memchr (const void *@@var{s}, int @@var{c}, size_t @@var{n})

This function searches memory starting at @@code{*@@var{s}} for the
character @@var{c}.  The search only ends with the first occurrence of
@@var{c}, or after @@var{length} characters; in particular, a null
character does not terminate the search.  If the character @@var{c} is
found within @@var{length} characters of @@code{*@@var{s}}, a pointer
to the character is returned.  If @@var{c} is not found, then @@code{NULL} is
returned.

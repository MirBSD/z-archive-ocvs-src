/* The bit_fix was implemented to support machines that need variables
   to be inserted in bitfields other than 1, 2 and 4 bytes.
   Furthermore it gives us a possibility to mask in bits in the symbol
   when it's fixed in the objectcode and check the symbols limits.

   The or-mask is used to set the huffman bits in displacements for the
   ns32k port.
   The acbi, addqi, movqi, cmpqi instruction requires an assembler that
   can handle bitfields.  Ie. handle an expression, evaluate it and insert
   the result in some bitfield.  (eg: 5 bits in a short field of an opcode)

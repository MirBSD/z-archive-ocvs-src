/*
 * For every sub-segment the user mentions in the ASsembler program,
 * we make one struct frchain. Each sub-segment has exactly one struct frchain
 * and vice versa.
 *
 * Struct frchain's are forward chained (in ascending order of sub-segment
 * code number). The chain runs through frch_next of each subsegment.
 * This makes it hard to find a subsegment's frags
 * if programmer uses a lot of them. Most programs only use text0 and
 * data0, so they don't suffer. At least this way:
 * (1)	There are no "arbitrary" restrictions on how many subsegments
 *	can be programmed;
 * (2)	Subsegments' frchain-s are (later) chained together in the order in
 *	which they are emitted for object file viz text then data.
 *
 * From each struct frchain dangles a chain of struct frags. The frags
 * represent code fragments, for that sub-segment, forward chained.

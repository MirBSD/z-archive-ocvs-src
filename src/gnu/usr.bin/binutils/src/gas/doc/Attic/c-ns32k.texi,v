@@chapter 32x32

@@section Options
The 32x32 version of @@code{@@value{AS}} accepts a @@samp{-m32032} option to
specify thiat it is compiling for a 32032 processor, or a
@@samp{-m32532} to specify that it is compiling for a 32532 option.
The default (if neither is specified) is chosen when the assembler
is compiled.

@@section Syntax
I don't know anything about the 32x32 syntax assembled by
@@code{@@value{AS}}.  Someone who understands the processor (I've never seen
one) and the possible syntaxes should write this section.

@@section Floating Point
The 32x32 uses @@sc{ieee} floating point numbers, but @@code{@@value{AS}}
only creates single or double precision values.  I don't know if the
32x32 understands extended precision numbers.

@@section 32x32 Machine Directives
The 32x32 has no machine dependent directives.

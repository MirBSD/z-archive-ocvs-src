#
# Bit operation instructions (BCLR, BNOT, BSET, BTST) should not be placed in IU.
# If the user specifically indicates they should be in the IU, GAS will
# generate warnings. The reason why this is not an error is that those instructions 
# will fail in IU only occasionally. Thus GAS should pack them in MU for
# safety, and it just needs to draw attention when a violation is given.

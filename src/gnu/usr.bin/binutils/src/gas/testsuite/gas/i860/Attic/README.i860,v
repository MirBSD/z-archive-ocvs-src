Testsuite for the i860 version of the GNU assembler
---------------------------------------------------

This is a simple testsuite for the i860 assembler.  It currently
consists mostly of testcases for checking that every instruction is
parsed correctly and that correct object code is generated (these
are called "blah.s").  The files called "blah-err.s" test for error
conditions.

The suite includes testcases for the base i860XR instruction set as well
as the enhanced i860XP instructions and control registers.

The expected results files were generated using the UNIX System V/i860
Release 4 vendor assembler (/usr/ccs/bin/as -V reports version
"Standard C Development Environment  (SCDE) 5.0 12/08/89").  This
way GAS/i860 is tested against a known good assembler.

TODO:
 - Relocation testing is basically non-existent.
 - pst.d (pixel store) is the only instruction with no testcase.
 - Some pseudo instructions need testcases (mov, all pfmov, etc.).
 - More tests for dual instruction mode: check that dual mode has a
   proper pair (FLOP/core) of instructions, and other error conditions.
 - Most current testcases use the default AT&T/SVR4 syntax; a few simple
   tests of the Intel syntax should be added to prevent bitrot (including
   relocatable expression syntax, etc).  Test file dual03.s uses Intel
   syntax lightly (i.e., register names without '%' prefix).

Contact me (Jason Eckhardt, jle@@rice.edu) if you'd like to help.

Known testsuite failures:
  - none.

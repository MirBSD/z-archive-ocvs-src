@! There was a bug in which a .cranges data hunk could include a hunk of
! code in front of it.  The following illustrates a function (start)
! followed by constants output into .rodata, followed by a function
! (continue), with a case-table (.L173) in it.  The bug included code from
! the start of the function (continue) into the case-table range descriptor.

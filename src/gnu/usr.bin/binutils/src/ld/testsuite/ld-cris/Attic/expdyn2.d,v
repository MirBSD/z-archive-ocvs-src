# Programs linked with --export-dynamic threw away .rela.got for exported
# symbols, but since got reference counter wasn't reset, there was a SEGV
# trying to generate the .rela.got relocations.  In this test, we have an
# object in the program that has pic-relocations to an exported symbol,
# but those relocations can be resolved at link-time.  We link to a DSO to
# get dynamic linking.

# Check that sections are automatically created to cope with contents at
# unexpected addresses.  We do this by linking .text at an unexpected
# address.  As .text (like .data) does not get a section descriptor, the
# output gets a LOP_LOC at an unexpected address, and a unique section is
# created.  This test will have to be changed if .text gets a section
# descriptor if linked to an unexpected address.

# unexpected addresses when an mmo is read in.  We used to do this by
# e.g. linking .text at an unexpected address, like in sec-9.d.  That no
# longer works, because .text and .data now gets section descriptors at
# mmo output when the address and contents doesn't trivially reflect the
# section contents at link time.  To test, we instead read in an mmo
# formed from a link to binary format, like the b-*.d tests for mmo
# execution paths.

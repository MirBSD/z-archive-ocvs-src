# This is based on sec-5.d which used to link .text at an unexpected
# address to check that a special section was created in objdump when
# reading in contents at an unusual location without a proper section
# descriptor.  As .text (like .data) now gets a section descriptor when
# linked to an unexpected location, the old test is transformed into a
# specific check that the section description for .text works.

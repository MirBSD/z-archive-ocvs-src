	2. The table of contents is placed immediately after idata4.
	   The ".private.toc" sections are generated by the ppc bfd. The
	   .toc variable is generated by gas, and resolved here. It is
	   used to initialized function descriptors (and anyone else who
	   needs the address of the module's toc). The only thing 
	   interesting about it at all? Most ppc instructions using it
	   have a 16bit displacement field. The convention for addressing
	   is to initialize the .toc value to 32K past the start of the
	   actual toc, and subtract 32K from all references, thus using
	   the entire 64K range. Naturally, the reloc code must agree

@as promised, deliver an all-target 64-bit bfd and appropriate libs,
binutils, ld and gas (though it can only support one target, it does
support alternative output (a.out, elf, coff for example) now).
it's -Wall -Werror SHELL=ksh clean.

then, regenerate the configure scripts etc.

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

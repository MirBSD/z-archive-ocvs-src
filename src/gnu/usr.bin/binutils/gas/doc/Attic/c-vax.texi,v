@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

@@section VAX Command-Line Options

@@cindex command-line options ignored, VAX
@@cindex VAX command-line options ignored
The Vax version of @@code{@@value{AS}} accepts any of the following options,
gives a warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.
These options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other
people's assemblers.

@@table @@code
@@cindex @@code{-D}, ignored on VAX
@@cindex @@code{-S}, ignored on VAX
@@cindex @@code{-T}, ignored on VAX
@@item @@code{-D} (Debug)
@@itemx @@code{-S} (Symbol Table)
@@itemx @@code{-T} (Token Trace)
These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

@@cindex @@code{-d}, VAX option
@@item @@code{-d} (Displacement size for JUMPs)
This option expects a number following the @@samp{-d}.  Like options
that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the
@@samp{-d} (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
argument that follows @@samp{-d} (@@sc{gnu} standard).

@@cindex @@code{-V}, redundant on VAX
@@item @@code{-V} (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)
Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option
commanded them to keep the information in active memory rather
than in a disk file.  @@code{@@value{AS}} always does this, so this
option is redundant.

@@cindex @@code{-J}, ignored on VAX
@@item @@code{-J} (JUMPify Longer Branches)
Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions
to do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and
fast) but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but
can branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3
flavors of branch: short, medium and long.  Some other
assemblers would emit short and medium branches, unless told by
this option to emit short and long branches.

@@cindex @@code{-t}, ignored on VAX
@@item @@code{-t} (Temporary File Directory)
Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary
file.  Since @@code{@@value{AS}} does not use a temporary disk file, this
option makes no difference.  @@samp{-t} needs exactly one
filename.

@@cindex VMS (VAX) options
@@cindex options for VAX/VMS
@@cindex VAX/VMS options
@@cindex Vax-11 C compatibility
@@cindex symbols with uppercase, VAX/VMS
The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

@@table @@samp
@@cindex @@samp{-h} option, VAX/VMS
@@item -h @@var{n}
External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are not
case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.  This is
contrary to the C language definition which explicitly distinguishes
upper and lower case.  To implement a standard conforming C compiler,
names must be changed (mapped) to preserve the case information.  The
default mapping is to convert all lower case characters to uppercase and
adding an underscore followed by a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24
digit binary value.  The one digits in the binary value represent which
characters are uppercase in the original symbol name.

The @@samp{-h @@var{n}} option determines how we map names.  This takes
several values.  No @@samp{-h} switch at all allows case hacking as
described above.  A value of zero (@@samp{-h0}) implies names should be
upper case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (@@samp{-h2})
implies names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
(@@samp{-h3}) implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
unused.  The @@code{-H} option directs @@code{@@value{AS}} to display
every mapped symbol during assembly.

Symbols whose names include a dollar sign @@samp{$} are exceptions to the
general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to reference
VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to upper case.

@@cindex @@samp{-+} option, VAX/VMS
@@item -+
The @@samp{-+} option causes @@code{@@value{AS}} to truncate any symbol
name larger than 31 characters.  The @@samp{-+} option also prevents some
code following the @@samp{_main} symbol normally added to make the object
file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

@@cindex @@samp{-1} option, VAX/VMS
@@item -1
This option is ignored for backward compatibility with @@code{@@value{AS}}
version 1.x.

@@cindex @@samp{-H} option, VAX/VMS
@@item -H
The @@samp{-H} option causes @@code{@@value{AS}} to print every symbol
which was changed by case mapping.

@@node VAX-float

@@cindex VAX floating point
@@cindex floating point, VAX
Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and
compatible with previous assemblers.  Rounding is
towards zero if the remainder is exactly half the least significant bit.

@@code{D}, @@code{F}, @@code{G} and @@code{H} floating point formats
are understood.

Immediate floating literals (@@emph{e.g.} @@samp{S`$6.9})
are rendered correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the
boundary case.

@@cindex @@code{float} directive, VAX

All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that @@code{case@@dots{}}

@@code{.word} statements.  This is compatible with all unix
assemblers we know of.

description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

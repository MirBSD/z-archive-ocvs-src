@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

@@section M88K Machine Directives

The M88K version of the assembler supports the following machine
directives:

@@table @@code
@@cindex @@code{align} directive, M88K
@@item .align
This directive aligns the section program counter on the next 4-byte
boundary.

@@cindex @@code{dfloat} directive, M88K
@@item .dfloat @@var{expr}
This assembles a double precision (64-bit) floating point constant.

@@cindex @@code{ffloat} directive, M88K
@@item .ffloat @@var{expr}
This assembles a single precision (32-bit) floating point constant.

@@cindex @@code{half} directive, M88K
@@item .half @@var{expr}
This directive assembles a half-word (16-bit) constant.

@@cindex @@code{word} directive, M88K
@@item .word @@var{expr}
This assembles a word (32-bit) constant.

@@cindex @@code{string} directive, M88K
@@item .string "@@var{str}"
This directive behaves like the standard @@code{.ascii} directive for
copying @@var{str} into the object file.  The string is not terminated
with a null byte.

@@cindex @@code{set} directive, M88K
@@item .set @@var{symbol}, @@var{value}
This directive creates a symbol named @@var{symbol} which is an alias for
another symbol (possibly not yet defined).  This should not be confused
with the mnemonic @@code{set}, which is a legitimate M88K instruction.

@@cindex @@code{def} directive, M88K
@@item .def @@var{symbol}, @@var{value}
This directive is synonymous with @@code{.set} and is presumably provided
for compatibility with other M88K assemblers.

@@cindex @@code{bss} directive, M88K
@@item .bss @@var{symbol}, @@var{length}, @@var{align}
Reserve @@var{length} bytes in the bss section for a local @@var{symbol},
aligned to the power of two specified by @@var{align}.  @@var{length} and
@@var{align} must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive
differs from @@samp{.lcomm} only in that it permits you to specify
an alignment.  @@xref{Lcomm,,@@code{.lcomm}}.

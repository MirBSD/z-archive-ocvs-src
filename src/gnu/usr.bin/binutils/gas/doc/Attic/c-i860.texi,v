@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

This is a fairly complete i860 assembler which is compatible with the
UNIX System V/860 Release 4 assembler. However, it does not currently
support SVR4 PIC (i.e., @@code{@@@@GOT, @@@@GOTOFF, @@@@PLT}).

Like the SVR4/860 assembler, the output object format is ELF32. Currently,
this is the only supported object format. If there is sufficient interest,
other formats such as COFF may be implemented.

For compatibility with some other i860 assemblers, a number of
pseudo-instructions are supported. While these are supported, they are
a very undesirable feature that should be avoided -- in particular, when
they result in an expansion to multiple actual i860 instructions. Below
are the pseudo-instructions that result in expansions.

The pseudo-instruction @@code{mov imm,%rn} (where the immediate does
not fit within a signed 16-bit field) will be expanded into:

@@end smallexample

The analogous expansions apply to @@code{ld.x, st.x, fld.x, pfld.x, fst.x}, and @@code{pst.x} as well.
@@item Signed large immediate with add/subtract:

If any of the arithmetic operations @@code{adds, addu, subs, subu} are used
with an immediate larger than 16-bits (signed), then they will be expanded.
For instance, the pseudo-instruction @@code{adds large_imm,%rx,%rn} expands to:

Both the Intel and AT&T/SVR4 syntaxes are supported, with the latter
being the default.  One difference is that AT&T syntax requires the '%'
prefix on register names while Intel syntax does not.  Another difference
is in the specification of relocatable expressions.  The Intel syntax
is @@code{ha%expression} whereas the SVR4 syntax is @@code{[expression]@@@@ha}
(and similarly for the "l" and "h" selectors).

Enable support for the i860XP instructions and control registers.  By default,
this option is disabled so that only the base instruction set (i.e., i860XR)

Intel syntax.
a95 8
The @@code{.dual}, @@code{.enddual}, and @@code{.atmp} directives are available only in the Intel syntax mode.

Both syntaxes allow for the standard @@code{.align} directive.  However,
the Intel syntax additionally allows keywords for the alignment
parameter: "@@code{.align type}", where `type' is one of @@code{.short}, @@code{.long},
@@code{.quad}, @@code{.single}, @@code{.double} representing alignments of 2, 4,
16, 4, and 8, respectively.

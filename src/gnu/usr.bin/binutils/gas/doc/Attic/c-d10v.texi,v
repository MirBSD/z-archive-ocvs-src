@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

@@subsection Size Modifiers
@@cindex D10V size modifiers
@@cindex size modifiers, D10V
The D10V version of @@code{@@value{AS}} uses the instruction names in the D10V
Architecture Manual.  However, the names in the manual are sometimes ambiguous.
There are instruction names that can assemble to a short or long form opcode.
How does the assembler pick the correct form?  @@code{@@value{AS}} will always pick the
smallest form if it can.  When dealing with a symbol that is not defined yet when a
line is being assembled, it will always use the long form.  If you need to force the 
assembler to use either the short or long form of the instruction, you can append
either @@samp{.s} (short) or @@samp{.l} (long) to it.  For example, if you are writing 
an assembly program and you want to do a branch to a symbol that is defined later
in your program, you can write @@samp{bra.s   foo}.  
Objdump and GDB will always append @@samp{.s} or @@samp{.l} to instructions which
have both short and long forms.

@@node D10V-Subs
@@subsection Sub-Instructions
@@cindex D10V sub-instructions
@@cindex sub-instructions, D10V
The D10V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either one-per-line,
or in the special two-per-line format described in the next section.  Some of these
instructions will be short-form or sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed
into a single instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also detect
when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label is defined, the next
instruction will never be packaged with the previous one.  Whenever a branch and link
instruction is called, it will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return
address will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

If you do not want the assembler automatically making these decisions, you can control
the packaging and execution type (parallel or sequential) with the special execution 
symbols described in the next section.

Sub-instructions may be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in parallel.
Instructions listed in the standard one-per-line format will be executed sequentially.

the execution symbol, or two instructions per line.  For example

Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in the right
container and is executed second.

description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

The Motorola 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of @@code{@@value{AS}} have a few machine
dependent options.

@@table @@code

@@cindex @@samp{-m68hc11}
@@item -m68hc11
This option switches the assembler in the M68HC11 mode. In this mode,

code for the 68HC11.

This option switches the assembler in the M68HC12 mode. In this mode,
the assembler also accepts 68HC12 operands and mnemonics. It produces
code for the 68HC12. A few 68HC11 instructions are replaced by
some 68HC12 instructions as recommended by Motorola specifications.

@@cindex @@samp{-m68hcs12}
@@item -m68hcs12
This option switches the assembler in the M68HCS12 mode.  This mode is
similar to @@samp{-m68hc12} but specifies to assemble for the 68HCS12
series.  The only difference is on the assembling of the @@samp{movb}
and @@samp{movw} instruction when a PC-relative operand is used.

@@cindex @@samp{-mshort}
@@item -mshort
This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer ABI.
It has no effect on the assembled instructions.
This is the default.

@@cindex @@samp{-mlong}
@@item -mlong
This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer ABI.

@@cindex @@samp{-mshort-double}
@@item -mshort-double
This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float ABI.
This is the default.

@@cindex @@samp{-mlong-double}
@@item -mlong-double
This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float ABI.

@@cindex @@samp{--strict-direct-mode}
@@item --strict-direct-mode
You can use the @@samp{--strict-direct-mode} option to disable
the automatic translation of direct page mode addressing into
extended mode when the instruction does not support direct mode.
For example, the @@samp{clr} instruction does not support direct page
mode addressing. When it is used with the direct page mode,
@@code{@@value{AS}} will ignore it and generate an absolute addressing.
This option prevents @@code{@@value{AS}} from doing this, and the wrong
usage of the direct page mode will raise an error.

@@cindex @@samp{--short-branchs}
@@item --short-branchs
The @@samp{--short-branchs} option turns off the translation of
relative branches into absolute branches when the branch offset is
out of range. By default @@code{@@value{AS}} transforms the relative
branch (@@samp{bsr}, @@samp{bgt}, @@samp{bge}, @@samp{beq}, @@samp{bne},
@@samp{ble}, @@samp{blt}, @@samp{bhi}, @@samp{bcc}, @@samp{bls},
@@samp{bcs}, @@samp{bmi}, @@samp{bvs}, @@samp{bvs}, @@samp{bra}) into
an absolute branch when the offset is out of the -128 .. 127 range.
In that case, the @@samp{bsr} instruction is translated into a
@@samp{jsr}, the @@samp{bra} instruction is translated into a
@@samp{jmp} and the conditional branchs instructions are inverted and
followed by a @@samp{jmp}. This option disables these translations
and @@code{@@value{AS}} will generate an error if a relative branch
is out of range. This option does not affect the optimization
associated to the @@samp{jbra}, @@samp{jbsr} and @@samp{jbXX} pseudo opcodes.

@@cindex @@samp{--force-long-branchs}
@@item --force-long-branchs
The @@samp{--force-long-branchs} option forces the translation of
relative branches into absolute branches. This option does not affect
the optimization associated to the @@samp{jbra}, @@samp{jbsr} and
@@samp{jbXX} pseudo opcodes. 

@@cindex @@samp{--print-insn-syntax}
@@item --print-insn-syntax
You can use the @@samp{--print-insn-syntax} option to obtain the
syntax description of the instruction when an error is detected.

@@cindex @@samp{--print-opcodes}
@@item --print-opcodes
The @@samp{--print-opcodes} option prints the list of all the
instructions with their syntax. The first item of each line
represents the instruction name and the rest of the line indicates
the possible operands for that instruction. The list is printed
in alphabetical order. Once the list is printed @@code{@@value{AS}}
exits.

@@cindex @@samp{--generate-example}
@@item --generate-example
The @@samp{--generate-example} option is similar to @@samp{--print-opcodes}
but it generates an example for each instruction instead.

it will treat them as comments. Example:

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses
in 68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is
the following:

@@smallexample
%modifier(symbol)
@@end smallexample

@@table @@code
@@cindex symbol modifiers
@@item %addr
This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use
the 16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is intended
to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in the memory bank window.
If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, the physical address
corresponds to the symbol address within the memory bank window.
If the symbol is not in a memory expansion part, this is the symbol address
(using or not using the %addr modifier has no effect in that case).

@@item %page
This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its page
number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the page containing
the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory
expansion part, the page number is 0.

@@item %hi
This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
address of the symbol.

@@item %lo
This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
address of the symbol.

expansion part could be written as follows:

@@cindex syntax, M68HC11

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses
in 68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is
the following:

@@smallexample
%modifier(symbol)
@@end smallexample

@@table @@code
@@cindex symbol modifiers
@@item %addr
This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use
the 16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is intended
to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in the memory bank window.
If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, the physical address
corresponds to the symbol address within the memory bank window.
If the symbol is not in a memory expansion part, this is the symbol address
(using or not using the %addr modifier has no effect in that case).

@@item %page
This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its page
number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the page containing
the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory
expansion part, the page number is 0.

@@item %hi
This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
address of the symbol.

@@item %lo
This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
address of the symbol.

@@end table

For example a 68HC12 call to a function @@samp{foo_example} stored in memory
expansion part could be written as follows:

@@smallexample
call %addr(foo_example),%page(foo_example)
@@end smallexample

and this is equivalent to

@@smallexample
call foo_example
@@end smallexample

And for 68HC11 it could be written as follows:

@@smallexample
ldab #%page(foo_example)
stab _page_switch
jsr  %addr(foo_example)

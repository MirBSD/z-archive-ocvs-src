@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are

|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

instruction sets during the assembly; see @@ref{MIPS ISA, Directives to
override the ISA level}.

@@item -mgp32
@@itemx -mfp32
Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit registers.
The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but these
flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 32 bits wide at
all times.  @@samp{-mgp32} controls the size of general-purpose registers
and @@samp{-mfp32} controls the size of floating-point registers.

On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag is
set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit OSes only
save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is essential never
to use the 64-bit registers.

@@item -mgp64
Assume that 64-bit general purpose registers are available.  This is
provided in the interests of symmetry with -gp32.

@@item -mips16

This tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.
@@samp{-no-mdmx} turns off this option.

@@item -mfix7000

Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register
of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two instructions.

@@item -mfix-vr4122-bugs
@@itemx -no-mfix-vr4122-bugs
Insert @@samp{nop} instructions to avoid errors in certain versions of
the vr4122 core.  This option is intended to be used on GCC-generated
code: it is not designed to catch errors in hand-written assembler code.

@@item -m4010
@@itemx -no-m4010
Generate code for the LSI @@sc{r4010} chip.  This tells the assembler to
accept the @@sc{r4010} specific instructions (@@samp{addciu}, @@samp{ffc},
etc.), and to not schedule @@samp{nop} instructions around accesses to
the @@samp{HI} and @@samp{LO} registers.  @@samp{-no-m4010} turns off this
option.

@@item -m4650

@@item -nocpp
This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line compatibility with
other assemblers, which use it to turn off C style preprocessing.  With
@@sc{gnu} @@code{@@value{AS}}, there is no need for @@samp{-nocpp}, because the
@@sc{gnu} assembler itself never runs the C preprocessor.

@@item --construct-floats
@@itemx --no-construct-floats
@@cindex --construct-floats
@@cindex --no-construct-floats
The @@code{--no-construct-floats} option disables the construction of
double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of the
value into the two single width floating point registers that make up
the double width register.  This feature is useful if the processor
support the FR bit in its status  register, and this bit is known (by
the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the aliasing of the double
width register by the single width registers.

By default @@code{--construct-floats} is selected, allowing construction
of these floating point constants.

rather than a break exception when an error is detected.  The trap instructions
are only supported at Instruction Set Architecture level 2 and higher.

@@item --break

@@end table

@@node MIPS Object
@@section MIPS ECOFF object code

@@cindex ECOFF sections
@@cindex MIPS ECOFF sections
Assembling for a @@sc{mips} @@sc{ecoff} target supports some additional sections
besides the usual @@code{.text}, @@code{.data} and @@code{.bss}.  The
additional sections are @@code{.rdata}, used for read-only data,
@@code{.sdata}, used for small data, and @@code{.sbss}, used for small
common objects.

@@cindex small objects, MIPS ECOFF
@@cindex @@code{gp} register, MIPS
When assembling for @@sc{ecoff}, the assembler uses the @@code{$gp} (@@code{$28})
register to form the address of a ``small object''.  Any object in the
@@code{.sdata} or @@code{.sbss} sections is considered ``small'' in this sense.
For external objects, or for objects in the @@code{.bss} section, you can use
the @@code{@@value{GCC}} @@samp{-G} option to control the size of objects addressed via
@@code{$gp}; the default value is 8, meaning that a reference to any object
eight bytes or smaller uses @@code{$gp}.  Passing @@samp{-G 0} to
@@code{@@value{AS}} prevents it from using the @@code{$gp} register on the basis
of object size (but the assembler uses @@code{$gp} for objects in @@code{.sdata}
or @@code{sbss} in any case).  The size of an object in the @@code{.bss} section
is set by the @@code{.comm} or @@code{.lcomm} directive that defines it.  The
size of an external object may be set with the @@code{.extern} directive.  For
example, @@samp{.extern sym,4} declares that the object at @@code{sym} is 4 bytes
in length, whie leaving @@code{sym} otherwise undefined.

Using small @@sc{ecoff} objects requires linker support, and assumes that the
@@code{$gp} register is correctly initialized (normally done automatically by
the startup code).  @@sc{mips} @@sc{ecoff} assembly code must not modify the
@@code{$gp} register.

@@node MIPS Stabs
@@section Directives for debugging information

@@cindex MIPS debugging directives
@@sc{mips} @@sc{ecoff} @@code{@@value{AS}} supports several directives used for
generating debugging information which are not support by traditional @@sc{mips}
assemblers.  These are @@code{.def}, @@code{.endef}, @@code{.dim}, @@code{.file},
@@code{.scl}, @@code{.size}, @@code{.tag}, @@code{.type}, @@code{.val},
@@code{.stabd}, @@code{.stabn}, and @@code{.stabs}.  The debugging information
generated by the three @@code{.stab} directives can only be read by @@sc{gdb},
not by traditional @@sc{mips} debuggers (this enhancement is required to fully
support C++ debugging).  These directives are primarily used by compilers, not
assembly language programmers!

@@node MIPS ISA
@@section Directives to override the ISA level

@@cindex MIPS ISA override
@@kindex @@code{.set mips@@var{n}}
@@sc{gnu} @@code{@@value{AS}} supports an additional directive to change
the @@sc{mips} Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: @@code{.set
mips@@var{n}}.  @@var{n} should be a number from 0 to 5, or 32, 32r2, or 64.
The values other than 0 make the assembler accept instructions
for the corresponding @@sc{isa} level, from that point on in the
assembly.  @@code{.set mips@@var{n}} affects not only which instructions
are permitted, but also how certain macros are expanded.  @@code{.set
mips0} restores the @@sc{isa} level to its original level: either the
level you selected with command line options, or the default for your
configuration.  You can use this feature to permit specific @@sc{r4000}
instructions while assembling in 32 bit mode.  Use this directive with
care!

The directive @@samp{.set mips16} puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode,
in which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
@@samp{.set nomips16} to return to normal 32 bit mode.

Traditional @@sc{mips} assemblers do not support this directive.

@@node MIPS autoextend
@@section Directives for extending MIPS 16 bit instructions

@@kindex @@code{.set autoextend}
@@kindex @@code{.set noautoextend}
By default, MIPS 16 instructions are automatically extended to 32 bits
when necessary.  The directive @@samp{.set noautoextend} will turn this
off.  When @@samp{.set noautoextend} is in effect, any 32 bit instruction
must be explicitly extended with the @@samp{.e} modifier (e.g.,
@@samp{li.e $4,1000}).  The directive @@samp{.set autoextend} may be used
to once again automatically extend instructions when necessary.

This directive is only meaningful when in MIPS 16 mode.  Traditional
@@sc{mips} assemblers do not support this directive.

@@node MIPS insn
@@section Directive to mark data as an instruction

@@kindex @@code{.insn}
The @@code{.insn} directive tells @@code{@@value{AS}} that the following
data is actually instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 mode:
when loading the address of a label which precedes instructions,
@@code{@@value{AS}} automatically adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to
the loaded address will do the right thing.

@@node MIPS option stack
@@section Directives to save and restore options

@@cindex MIPS option stack
@@kindex @@code{.set push}
@@kindex @@code{.set pop}
The directives @@code{.set push} and @@code{.set pop} may be used to save
and restore the current settings for all the options which are
controlled by @@code{.set}.  The @@code{.set push} directive saves the
current settings on a stack.  The @@code{.set pop} directive pops the
stack and restores the settings.

These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

Traditional @@sc{mips} assemblers do not support these directives.

@@node MIPS ASE instruction generation overrides
@@section Directives to control generation of MIPS ASE instructions

@@cindex MIPS MIPS-3D instruction generation override
@@kindex @@code{.set mips3d}
@@kindex @@code{.set nomips3d}
The directive @@code{.set mips3d} makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension from that point on
in the assembly.  The @@code{.set nomips3d} directive prevents MIPS-3D
instructions from being accepted.

@@cindex MIPS MDMX instruction generation override
@@kindex @@code{.set mdmx}
@@kindex @@code{.set nomdmx}
The directive @@code{.set mdmx} makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MDMX Application Specific Extension from that point on
in the assembly.  The @@code{.set nomdmx} directive prevents MDMX
instructions from being accepted.

Traditional @@sc{mips} assemblers do not support these directives.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@@itemx -mfp32
Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit registers.
The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but these
flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 32 bits wide at
all times.  @@samp{-mgp32} controls the size of general-purpose registers
and @@samp{-mfp32} controls the size of floating-point registers.

On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag is
set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit OSes only
save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is essential never
to use the 64-bit registers.

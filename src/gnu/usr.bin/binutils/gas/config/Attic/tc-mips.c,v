/* Since the MIPS does not have multiple forms of PC relative
   instructions, we do not have to do relaxing as is done on other
   platforms.  However, we do have to handle GP relative addressing
   correctly, which turns out to be a similar problem.

   Every macro that refers to a symbol can occur in (at least) two
   forms, one with GP relative addressing and one without.  For
   example, loading a global variable into a register generally uses
   a macro instruction like this:
     lw $4,i
   If i can be addressed off the GP register (this is true if it is in
   the .sbss or .sdata section, or if it is known to be smaller than
   the -G argument) this will generate the following instruction:
     lw $4,i($gp)
   This instruction will use a GPREL reloc.  If i can not be addressed
   off the GP register, the following instruction sequence will be used:
     lui $at,i
     lw $4,i($at)
   In this case the first instruction will have a HI16 reloc, and the
   second reloc will have a LO16 reloc.  Both relocs will be against
   the symbol i.

   The issue here is that we may not know whether i is GP addressable
   until after we see the instruction that uses it.  Therefore, we
   want to be able to choose the final instruction sequence only at
   the end of the assembly.  This is similar to the way other
   platforms choose the size of a PC relative instruction only at the
   end of assembly.

   When generating position independent code we do not use GP
   addressing in quite the same way, but the issue still arises as
   external symbols and local symbols must be handled differently.

   We handle these issues by actually generating both possible
   instruction sequences.  The longer one is put in a frag_var with
   type rs_machine_dependent.  We encode what to do with the frag in
   the subtype field.  We encode (1) the number of existing bytes to
   replace, (2) the number of new bytes to use, (3) the offset from
   the start of the existing bytes to the first reloc we must generate
   (that is, the offset is applied from the start of the existing
   bytes after they are replaced by the new bytes, if any), (4) the
   offset from the start of the existing bytes to the second reloc,
   (5) whether a third reloc is needed (the third reloc is always four
   bytes after the second reloc), and (6) whether to warn if this
   variant is used (this is sometimes needed if .set nomacro or .set
   noat is in effect).  All these numbers are reasonably small.

   Generating two instruction sequences must be handled carefully to
   ensure that delay slots are handled correctly.  Fortunately, there
   are a limited number of cases.  When the second instruction
   sequence is generated, append_insn is directed to maintain the
   existing delay slot information, so it continues to apply to any
   code after the second instruction sequence.  This means that the
   second instruction sequence must not impose any requirements not
   required by the first instruction sequence.

   These variant frags are then handled in functions called by the
   machine independent code.  md_estimate_size_before_relax returns
   the final size of the frag.  md_convert_frag sets up the final form
   of the frag.  tc_gen_reloc adjust the first reloc and adds a second
   one if needed.  */

/* Branch without likely bit.  If label is out of range, we turn:

   into

        bne reg1, reg2, 0f
        nop
        j label
     0: delay slot

   with the following opcode replacements:

	beq <-> bne
	blez <-> bgtz
	bltz <-> bgez
	bc1f <-> bc1t

	bltzal <-> bgezal  (with jal label instead of j label)

   Even though keeping the delay slot instruction in the delay slot of
   the branch would be more efficient, it would be very tricky to do
   correctly, because we'd have to introduce a variable frag *after*
   the delay slot instruction, and expand that instead.  Let's do it
   the easy way for now, even if the branch-not-taken case now costs
   one additional instruction.  Out-of-range branches are not supposed
   to be common, anyway.

   Branch likely.  If label is out of range, we turn:

	beql reg1, reg2, label
	delay slot (annulled if branch not taken)

   into

        beql reg1, reg2, 1f
        nop
        beql $0, $0, 2f
        nop
     1: j[al] label
        delay slot (executed only if branch taken)
     2:

   It would be possible to generate a shorter sequence by losing the
   likely bit, generating something like:

	bne reg1, reg2, 0f
	nop
	j[al] label
	delay slot (executed only if branch taken)
     0:

	beql -> bne
	bnel -> beq
	blezl -> bgtz
	bgtzl -> blez
	bltzl -> bgez
	bgezl -> bltz
	bc1fl -> bc1t
	bc1tl -> bc1f

	bltzall -> bgezal  (with jal label instead of j label)
	bgezall -> bltzal  (ditto)


   but it's not clear that it would actually improve performance.  */

/* For mips16 code, we use an entirely different form of relaxation.
   mips16 supports two versions of most instructions which take
   immediate values: a small one which takes some small value, and a
   larger one which takes a 16 bit value.  Since branches also follow
   this pattern, relaxing these values is required.

   We can assemble both mips16 and normal MIPS code in a single
   object.  Therefore, we need to support this type of relaxation at
   the same time that we support the relaxation described above.  We
   use the high bit of the subtype field to distinguish these cases.

   The information we store for this type of relaxation is the
   argument code found in the opcode file for this relocation, whether
   the user explicitly requested a small or extended form, and whether
   the relocation is in a jump or jal delay slot.  That tells us the
   size of the value, and how it should be stored.  We also store
   whether the fragment is considered to be extended or not.  We also
   store whether this is known to be a branch to a different section,
   whether we have tried to relax this frag yet, and whether we have
   ever extended a PC relative fragment because of a shift count.  */

 * The ensuing load upper instructions are ommited. This implies some kind
 * of global optimization. We currently only optimize within a single macro.
 *   For many of the load and store macros if the address is specified as a
 * constant expression in the first 64k of memory (ie ld $2,0x4000c) we
 * first load register 'at' with zero and use it as the base register. The
 * mips assembler simply uses register $zero. Just one tiny optimization

	     If we have 64-bit addresses, as an optimization, for

	     addresses) we fall back to the 32-bit address generation
	     mechanism since it is more efficient.  Note that due to
	     the signed offset used by memory operations, the 32-bit
	     range is shifted down by 32768 here.  This code should
	     probably attempt to generate 64-bit constants more
	     efficiently in general.

	     As an extension for architectures with 64-bit registers,
	     we don't truncate 64-bit addresses given as literal
	     constants down to 32 bits, to support existing practice
	     in the mips64 Linux (the kernel), that compiles source
	     files with -mabi=64, assembling them as o32 or n32 (with
	     -Wa,-32 or -Wa,-n32).  This is not beautiful, but since
	     the whole kernel is loaded into a memory region that is
	     addressible with sign-extended 32-bit addresses, it is
	     wasteful to compute the upper 32 bits of every
	     non-literal address, that takes more space and time.
	     Some day this should probably be implemented as an
	     assembler option, such that the kernel doesn't have to
	     use such ugly hacks, even though it will still have to
	     end up converting the binary to ELF32 for a number of
	     platforms whose boot loaders don't support ELF64

@looks as if some sour wine (Federweier <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

   FIXME: GCC makes a distinction between -mcpu=FOO and -mFOO:
   -mcpu=FOO schedules for FOO, but still produces code that meets the
   requirements of MIPS ISA I.  For example, it won't generate any
   FOO-specific instructions, and it will still assume that any
   scheduling hazards described in MIPS ISA I are there, even if FOO
   has interlocks.  -mFOO gives GCC permission to generate code that
   will only run on a FOO; it will generate FOO-specific instructions,
   and assume interlocks provided by a FOO.

   However, GAS currently doesn't make this distinction; before Jan 28
   1999, GAS's -mcpu=FOO implied -mFOO, which violates GCC's
   assumptions.  The GCC driver passes these flags through to GAS, so
   if GAS actually does anything that doesn't meet MIPS ISA I with
   -mFOO, then GCC's -mcpu=FOO flag isn't going to work.

   And furthermore, it did not assume that -mFOO implied -mcpu=FOO,
   which seems senseless --- why generate code which will only run on
   a FOO, but schedule for something else?
d316 2
a317 1
   So now, at least, -mcpu=FOO and -mFOO are exactly equivalent.

        j label

   with the following opcode replacements:

	beq <-> bne
	blez <-> bgtz
	bltz <-> bgez
	bc1f <-> bc1t

	bltzal <-> bgezal  (with jal label instead of j label)

   Even though keeping the delay slot instruction in the delay slot of
   the branch would be more efficient, it would be very tricky to do
   correctly, because we'd have to introduce a variable frag *after*
   the delay slot instruction, and expand that instead.  Let's do it
   the easy way for now, even if the branch-not-taken case now costs
   one additional instruction.  Out-of-range branches are not supposed
   to be common, anyway.

   Branch likely.  If label is out of range, we turn:

	beql reg1, reg2, label
	delay slot (annulled if branch not taken)

   into

        beql reg1, reg2, 1f
        nop
        beql $0, $0, 2f
        nop
     1: j[al] label
        delay slot (executed only if branch taken)
     2:

   It would be possible to generate a shorter sequence by losing the
   likely bit, generating something like:

	bne reg1, reg2, 0f
	nop
	j[al] label
	delay slot (executed only if branch taken)
     0:

	beql -> bne
	bnel -> beq
	blezl -> bgtz
	bgtzl -> blez
	bltzl -> bgez
	bgezl -> bltz
	bc1fl -> bc1t
	bc1tl -> bc1f

	bltzall -> bgezal  (with jal label instead of j label)
	bgezall -> bltzal  (ditto)


   but it's not clear that it would actually improve performance.  */

	     If we have 64-bit addresses, as an optimization, for
	     addresses which are 32-bit constants (e.g. kseg0/kseg1
	     addresses) we fall back to the 32-bit address generation
	     mechanism since it is more efficient.  Note that due to
	     the signed offset used by memory operations, the 32-bit
	     range is shifted down by 32768 here.  This code should
	     probably attempt to generate 64-bit constants more
	     efficiently in general.

	     As an extension for architectures with 64-bit registers,
	     we don't truncate 64-bit addresses given as literal
	     constants down to 32 bits, to support existing practice
	     in the mips64 Linux (the kernel), that compiles source
	     files with -mabi=64, assembling them as o32 or n32 (with
	     -Wa,-32 or -Wa,-n32).  This is not beautiful, but since
	     the whole kernel is loaded into a memory region that is
	     addressible with sign-extended 32-bit addresses, it is
	     wasteful to compute the upper 32 bits of every
	     non-literal address, that takes more space and time.
	     Some day this should probably be implemented as an
	     assembler option, such that the kernel doesn't have to
	     use such ugly hacks, even though it will still have to
	     end up converting the binary to ELF32 for a number of
	     platforms whose boot loaders don't support ELF64
	     binaries.  */

/* The expansion of many macros depends on the type of symbol that
   they refer to.  For example, when generating position-dependent code,
   a macro that refers to a symbol may have two different expansions,
   one which uses GP-relative addresses and one which uses absolute
   addresses.  When generating SVR4-style PIC, a macro may have
   different expansions for local and global symbols.

   We handle these situations by generating both sequences and putting
   them in variant frags.  In position-dependent code, the first sequence
   will be the GP-relative one and the second sequence will be the
   absolute one.  In SVR4 PIC, the first sequence will be for global
   symbols and the second will be for local symbols.

   The frag's "subtype" is RELAX_ENCODE (FIRST, SECOND), where FIRST and
   SECOND are the lengths of the two sequences in bytes.  These fields
   can be extracted using RELAX_FIRST() and RELAX_SECOND().  In addition,
   the subtype has the following flags:

   RELAX_USE_SECOND
	Set if it has been decided that we should use the second
	sequence instead of the first.

   RELAX_SECOND_LONGER
	Set in the first variant frag if the macro's second implementation
	is longer than its first.  This refers to the macro as a whole,
	not an individual relaxation.

   RELAX_NOMACRO
	Set in the first variant frag if the macro appeared in a .set nomacro
	block and if one alternative requires a warning but the other does not.

   RELAX_DELAY_SLOT
	Like RELAX_NOMACRO, but indicates that the macro appears in a branch
	delay slot.

   The frag's "opcode" points to the first fixup for relaxable code.

   Relaxable macros are generated using a sequence such as:

      relax_start (SYMBOL);
      ... generate first expansion ...
      relax_switch ();
      ... generate second expansion ...
      relax_end ();

   The code and fixups for the unwanted alternative are discarded

   into

        nop
        j label

   with the following opcode replacements:

	beq <-> bne
	blez <-> bgtz
	bltz <-> bgez
	bc1f <-> bc1t

	bltzal <-> bgezal  (with jal label instead of j label)

   Even though keeping the delay slot instruction in the delay slot of
   the branch would be more efficient, it would be very tricky to do
   correctly, because we'd have to introduce a variable frag *after*
   the delay slot instruction, and expand that instead.  Let's do it
   the easy way for now, even if the branch-not-taken case now costs
   one additional instruction.  Out-of-range branches are not supposed
   to be common, anyway.

   Branch likely.  If label is out of range, we turn:

	beql reg1, reg2, label
	delay slot (annulled if branch not taken)

   into

        beql reg1, reg2, 1f
        nop
        beql $0, $0, 2f
        nop
     1: j[al] label
        delay slot (executed only if branch taken)
     2:

   It would be possible to generate a shorter sequence by losing the
   likely bit, generating something like:

	bne reg1, reg2, 0f
	nop
	j[al] label
	delay slot (executed only if branch taken)
     0:

	beql -> bne
	bnel -> beq
	blezl -> bgtz
	bgtzl -> blez
	bltzl -> bgez
	bgezl -> bltz
	bc1fl -> bc1t
	bc1tl -> bc1f

	bltzall -> bgezal  (with jal label instead of j label)
	bgezall -> bltzal  (ditto)


   but it's not clear that it would actually improve performance.  */

	     If we have 64-bit addresses, as an optimization, for
	     addresses which are 32-bit constants (e.g. kseg0/kseg1
	     addresses) we fall back to the 32-bit address generation
	     mechanism since it is more efficient.  Note that due to
	     the signed offset used by memory operations, the 32-bit
	     range is shifted down by 32768 here.  This code should
	     probably attempt to generate 64-bit constants more
	     efficiently in general.

	     As an extension for architectures with 64-bit registers,
	     we don't truncate 64-bit addresses given as literal
	     constants down to 32 bits, to support existing practice
	     in the mips64 Linux (the kernel), that compiles source
	     files with -mabi=64, assembling them as o32 or n32 (with
	     -Wa,-32 or -Wa,-n32).  This is not beautiful, but since
	     the whole kernel is loaded into a memory region that is
	     addressible with sign-extended 32-bit addresses, it is
	     wasteful to compute the upper 32 bits of every
	     non-literal address, that takes more space and time.
	     Some day this should probably be implemented as an
	     assembler option, such that the kernel doesn't have to
	     use such ugly hacks, even though it will still have to
	     end up converting the binary to ELF32 for a number of
	     platforms whose boot loaders don't support ELF64
	     binaries.  */

/*
 * For every sub-segment the user mentions in the ASsembler program,
 * we make one struct frchain. Each sub-segment has exactly one struct frchain
 * and vice versa.
 *
 * Struct frchain's are forward chained (in ascending order of sub-segment
 * code number). The chain runs through frch_next of each subsegment.
 * This makes it hard to find a subsegment's frags
 * if programmer uses a lot of them. Most programs only use text0 and
 * data0, so they don't suffer. At least this way:
 * (1)	There are no "arbitrary" restrictions on how many subsegments
 *	can be programmed;
 * (2)	Subsegments' frchain-s are (later) chained together in the order in
 *	which they are emitted for object file viz text then data.
 *
 * From each struct frchain dangles a chain of struct frags. The frags
 * represent code fragments, for that sub-segment, forward chained.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/* string blocks

   I had a couple of choices when deciding upon this data structure.
   gas uses null terminated strings for all its internal work.  This
   often means that parts of the program that want to examine
   substrings have to manipulate the data in the string to do the
   right thing (a common operation is to single out a bit of text by
   saving away the character after it, nulling it out, operating on
   the substring and then replacing the character which was under the
   null).  This is a pain and I remember a load of problems that I had with
   code in gas which almost got this right.  Also, it's harder to grow and
   allocate null terminated strings efficiently.

   Obstacks provide all the functionality needed, but are too
   complicated, hence the sb.

   An sb is allocated by the caller, and is initialzed to point to an
   sb_element.  sb_elements are kept on a free lists, and used when
   needed, replaced onto the free list when unused.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

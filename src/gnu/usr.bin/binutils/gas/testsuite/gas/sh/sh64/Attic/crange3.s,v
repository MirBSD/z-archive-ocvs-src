@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

@! There was a bug in which a .cranges data hunk could include a hunk of
! code in front of it.  The following illustrates a function (start)
! followed by constants output into .rodata, followed by a function
! (continue), with a case-table (.L173) in it.  The bug included code from
! the start of the function (continue) into the case-table range descriptor.

	.text
	.mode SHmedia
start:
	nop
	.section .rodata
	.long 0xabcdef01
	.long 0x12345678

continue:

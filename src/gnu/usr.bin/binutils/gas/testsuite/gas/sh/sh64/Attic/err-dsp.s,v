@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

@! Check that we get errors when assembling DSP instructions.

! { dg-do assemble }

! Regarding the opcode table, all insns are marked arch_sh_dsp_up; there are
! no insns marked arch_sh3_dsp_up.  We check a few marked arch_sh_dsp_up:
! two have operands only recognized with -dsp; the other has an opcode not

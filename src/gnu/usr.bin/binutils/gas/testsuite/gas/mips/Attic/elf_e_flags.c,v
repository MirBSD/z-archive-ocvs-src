@/* This file isn't directly used by the test suite; it uses
   elf_e_flags.s.  However, I figured it would be nice to provide the
   source code from which the .s file was generated.

   It was compiled as follows:

   mips64-elf-gcc -m4650 -S -O elf_e_flags.c

   We use the -m4650 flag to get the 4650-specific 'mul' instruction
   in there; the test suite wants to be sure that GAS's -m4650 flag
   will indeed cause it to generate the 4650 mul instruction, and not
   expand it as a macro.

   Ian 10 June 1999: I tweaked the resulting assembler file so that it
   would generate the same code when gas was configured for mips-elf
   and for mips64-elf.

   18 October 2000: Chris Demetriou <cgd@@sibyte.com> tweaked the code so
   that it would always generate enough zero-padding at the end to make
   objdump print "...", so that the test would be successful even on
   machines that pad results to cache line or other boundaries
   (e.g. mips-linux). */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

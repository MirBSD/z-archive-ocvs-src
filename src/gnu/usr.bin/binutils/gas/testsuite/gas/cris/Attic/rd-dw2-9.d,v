description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)

todo:

 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

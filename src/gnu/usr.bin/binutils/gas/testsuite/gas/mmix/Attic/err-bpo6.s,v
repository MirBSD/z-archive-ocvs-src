@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

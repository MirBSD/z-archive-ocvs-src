@looks as if some sour wine (Federweiﬂer <german>, for an English
description see http://forum.leo.org/archiv/2002_11/04/20021104125717e_en.html)
could help me to bear the pain upgrading binutils to 2.14

todo:
 - test if this works at all
 - test if this works
 - test if nothing breaks
 - nuke all occurences of "false" and "true" in binutils (including gdb),
   see bfd.h "Poison" for reference
 - talk to the OpenBSD people, ask them if they could improve this

@# Test for warnings when placing yield instructions into IQ2000's
# branch delay slot.  Written by Ben Elliston (bje@@redhat.com)

# Run GAS and check that it emits the desired warning for the test case.
# Arguments:
#   file -- name of the test case to assemble.
#   testname -- a string describing the test.
#   warnpattern -- a regular expression, suitable for use by the Tcl
#     regexp command, to decide if the warning string was emitted by
#     the assembler to stderr.

proc iq2000_warning_test { file testname {warnpattern ""} } {
    global comp_output

    gas_run $file "-m10" ">/dev/null"
    verbose "output was $comp_output" 2

    if {$warnpattern == ""} {
	if {$comp_output == ""} { pass $testname } else { fail $testname }
	return
    }

    if {[regexp "Warning: $warnpattern" $comp_output]} {

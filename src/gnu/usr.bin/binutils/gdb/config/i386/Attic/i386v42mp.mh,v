# NATDEPFILES must remain entirely on one line.  When building a cross
# debugger, configure will cause this line to be commented out in the
# Makefile.  Many non-GNU versions of make don't permit the use of a
# continuation character (backslash) to extend a commented line.  As a
# consequence, make considers subsequent tab-indented lines to be
# some sort of error.

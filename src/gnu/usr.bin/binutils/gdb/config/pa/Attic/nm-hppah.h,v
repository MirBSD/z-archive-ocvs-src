   watchpoints, and save (possibly precious) hardware watchpoints for other
   locations.

   On HP-UX, we choose not to watch stack-based addresses, because

   [1] Our implementation relies on page protection traps.  The granularity
   of these is large and so can generate many false hits, which are expensive
   to respond to.

   [2] Watches of "*p" where we may not know the symbol that p points to,
   make it difficult to know when the addressed object is out of scope, and
   hence shouldn't be watched.  Page protection that isn't removed when the
   addressed object is out of scope will either degrade execution speed
   (false hits) or give false triggers (when the address is recycled by
   other calls).

   allow the write to happen); restore page-protections; and check whether
   any watchpoint triggered.

   If none did, then the write was to a "nearby" location that just happens
   to fall on the same page as a watched location, and so can be ignored.

   entries and returns.  When the inferior enters a syscall, we disable

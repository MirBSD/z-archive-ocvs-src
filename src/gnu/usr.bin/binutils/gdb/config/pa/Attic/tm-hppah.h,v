   the return pointer for the signal handler to point to _sigreturn.  */

/* For HPUX:

   The signal context structure pointer is always saved at the base
   of the frame which "calls" the signal handler.  We only want to find
   the hardware save state structure, which lives 10 32bit words into
   sigcontext structure.

   Within the hardware save state structure, registers are found in the
   same order as the register numbers in GDB.

   At one time we peeked at %r31 rather than the PC queues to determine
   what instruction took the fault.  This was done on purpose, but I don't
   remember why.  Looking at the PC queues is really the right way, and
   I don't remember why that didn't work when this code was originally
   written.  */

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

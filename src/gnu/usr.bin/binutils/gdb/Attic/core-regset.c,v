/*			N  O  T  E  S

This file is used by most systems that implement /proc.  For these systems,
the general registers are laid out the same way in both the core file and
the gregset_p structure.  The current exception to this is Irix-4.*, where
the gregset_p structure is split up into two pieces in the core file.

The general register and floating point register sets are manipulated by
separate ioctl's.  This file makes the assumption that if FP0_REGNUM is
defined, then support for the floating point register set is desired,
regardless of whether or not the actual target has floating point hardware.

GLOBAL FUNCTION

	fetch_core_registers -- fetch current registers from core file

SYNOPSIS

	void fetch_core_registers (char *core_reg_sect,
					  unsigned core_reg_size,
					  int which, CORE_ADDR reg_addr)

DESCRIPTION

	Read the values of either the general register set (WHICH equals 0)
	or the floating point register set (WHICH equals 2) from the core
	file data (pointed to by CORE_REG_SECT), and update gdb's idea of
	their current values.  The CORE_REG_SIZE parameter is ignored.

NOTES

	Use the indicated sizes to validate the gregset and fpregset
	structures.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

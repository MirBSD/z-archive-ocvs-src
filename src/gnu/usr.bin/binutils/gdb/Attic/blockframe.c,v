/* This change should not be needed, FIXME!  We should

   express what goes on here.

      INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO is called from two places: create_new_frame
      		(where the PC is already set up) and here (where it isn't).
      INIT_FRAME_PC is only called from here, always after
      		INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO.
   
   The catch is the MIPS, where INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO requires the PC
   value (which hasn't been set yet).  Some other machines appear to
   require INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO before they can do INIT_FRAME_PC.  Phoo.

   We shouldn't need INIT_FRAME_PC_FIRST to add more complication to
   an already overcomplicated part of GDB.   gnu@@cygnus.com, 15Sep92.

   Assuming that some machines need INIT_FRAME_PC after
   INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO, one possible scheme:

   SETUP_INNERMOST_FRAME()
     Default version is just create_new_frame (read_fp ()),
     read_pc ()).  Machines with extra frame info would do that (or the
     local equivalent) and then set the extra fields.
   SETUP_ARBITRARY_FRAME(argc, argv)
     Only change here is that create_new_frame would no longer init extra
     frame info; SETUP_ARBITRARY_FRAME would have to do that.
   INIT_PREV_FRAME(fromleaf, prev)
     Replace INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO and INIT_FRAME_PC.  This should
     also return a flag saying whether to keep the new frame, or
     whether to discard it, because on some machines (e.g.  mips) it
     is really awkward to have FRAME_CHAIN_VALID called *before*
     INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO (there is no good way to get information
     deduced in FRAME_CHAIN_VALID into the extra fields of the new frame).
   std_frame_pc(fromleaf, prev)
     This is the default setting for INIT_PREV_FRAME.  It just does what
     the default INIT_FRAME_PC does.  Some machines will call it from
     INIT_PREV_FRAME (either at the beginning, the end, or in the middle).
     Some machines won't use it.

   "top" refer to some section of memory which contains the code for
   the call dummy.  Calls to this macro assume that the contents of
   SP_REGNUM and DEPRECATED_FP_REGNUM (or the saved values thereof),

   This won't work on the 29k, where SP_REGNUM and
   DEPRECATED_FP_REGNUM don't have that meaning, but the 29k doesn't
   use ON_STACK.  This could be fixed by generalizing this scheme,
   perhaps by passing in a frame and adding a few fields, at least on
   machines which need them for DEPRECATED_PC_IN_CALL_DUMMY.

   Something simpler, like checking for the stack segment, doesn't work,
   since various programs (threads implementations, gcc nested function
   stubs, etc) may either allocate stack frames in another segment, or
   allocate other kinds of code on the stack.  */

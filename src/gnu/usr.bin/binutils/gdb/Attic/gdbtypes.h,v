     example, an i386 extended-precision floating point value really
     only occupies ten bytes, but most ABI's declare its size to be
     12 bytes, to preserve alignment.  A `struct type' representing
     such a floating-point type would have a `length' value of 12,

     There's a bit of a host/target mess here, if you're concerned
     about machines whose bytes aren't eight bits long, or who don't
     have byte-addressed memory.  Various places pass this to memcpy
     and such, meaning it must be in units of host bytes.  Various
     other places expect they can calculate addresses by adding it
     and such, meaning it must be in units of target bytes.  For
     some DSP targets, in which HOST_CHAR_BIT will (presumably) be 8
     and TARGET_CHAR_BIT will be (say) 32, this is a problem.

     One fix would be to make this field in bits (requiring that it
     always be a multiple of HOST_CHAR_BIT and TARGET_CHAR_BIT) ---
     the other choice would be to make it consistently in units of
     HOST_CHAR_BIT.  However, this would still fail to address
     machines based on a ternary or decimal representation.  */

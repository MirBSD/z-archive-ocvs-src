/* 
   The data cache could lead to incorrect results because it doesn't know
   about volatile variables, thus making it impossible to debug
   functions which use memory mapped I/O devices.

   set remotecache 0

   In those cases.

   In general the dcache speeds up performance, some speed improvement
   comes from the actual caching mechanism, but the major gain is in
   the reduction of the remote protocol overhead; instead of reading
   or writing a large area of memory in 4 byte requests, the cache
   bundles up the requests into 32 byte (actually LINE_SIZE) chunks.
   Reducing the overhead to an eighth of what it was.  This is very
   obvious when displaying a large amount of data,

   eg, x/200x 0 

   caching     |   no    yes 
   ---------------------------- 
   first time  |   4 sec  2 sec improvement due to chunking 
   second time |   4 sec  0 sec improvement due to caching

   The cache structure is unusual, we keep a number of cache blocks
   (DCACHE_SIZE) and each one caches a LINE_SIZEed area of memory.
   Within each line we remember the address of the line (always a
   multiple of the LINE_SIZE) and a vector of bytes over the range.
   There's another vector which contains the state of the bytes.

   ENTRY_BAD means that the byte is just plain wrong, and has no
   correspondence with anything else (as it would when the cache is
   turned on, but nothing has been done to it.

   ENTRY_DIRTY means that the byte has some data in it which should be
   written out to the remote target one day, but contains correct
   data.  ENTRY_OK means that the data is the same in the cache as it
   is in remote memory.


   The ENTRY_DIRTY state is necessary because GDB likes to write large
   lumps of memory in small bits.  If the caching mechanism didn't
   maintain the DIRTY information, then something like a two byte
   write would mean that the entire cache line would have to be read,
   the two bytes modified and then written out again.  The alternative
   would be to not read in the cache line in the first place, and just
   write the two bytes directly into target memory.  The trouble with
   that is that it really nails performance, because of the remote
   protocol overhead.  This way, all those little writes are bundled
   up into an entire cache line write in one go, without having to
   read the cache line in the first place.

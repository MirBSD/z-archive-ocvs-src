FIXME: Resolve minor differences between what information we put in the

put enum constants there.  And dbxread seems to invent a lot of typedefs
we never see.  Use the new printpsym command to see the partial symbol table

   In order to make it easier to randomly access the attribute fields

   each DIE is scanned and an instance of the "struct dieinfo"

   Initialization is done in two levels.  The first, done by basicdieinfo(),
   just initializes those fields that are vital to deciding whether or not
   to use this DIE, how to skip past it, etc.  The second, done by the
   function completedieinfo(), fills in the rest of the information.

   Attributes which have block forms are not interpreted at the time
   the DIE is scanned, instead we just save pointers to the start
   of their value fields.

   Some fields have a flag <name>_p that is set when the value of the
   field is valid (I.E. we found a matching attribute in the DIE).  Since
   we may want to test for the presence of some attributes in the DIE,
   such as AT_low_pc, without restricting the values of the field,
   we need someway to note that we found such an attribute.

/* DIES which have user defined types or modified user defined types refer to

   Originally this was done using a simple but expensive algorithm, with an
   array of unsorted structures, each containing an offset/type-pointer pair.
   This array was scanned linearly each time a lookup was done.  The result
   was that gdb was spending over half it's startup time munging through this
   array of pointers looking for a structure that had the right offset member.

   The second attempt used the same array of structures, but the array was
   sorted using qsort each time a new offset/type was recorded, and a binary
   search was used to find the type pointer for a given DIE offset.  This was
   even slower, due to the overhead of sorting the array each time a new
   offset/type pair was entered.

   The third attempt uses a fixed size array of type pointers, indexed by a
   value derived from the DIE offset.  Since the minimum DIE size is 4 bytes,
   we can divide any DIE offset by 4 to obtain a unique index into this fixed
   size array.  Since each element is a 4 byte pointer, it takes exactly as
   much memory to hold this array as to hold the DWARF info for a given
   compilation unit.  But it gets freed as soon as we are done with it.
   This has worked well in practice, as a reasonable tradeoff between memory
   consumption and speed, without having to resort to much more complicated
   algorithms. */

LOCAL FUNCTION

	dwarf_fundamental_type -- lookup or create a fundamental type

SYNOPSIS

	struct type *
	dwarf_fundamental_type (struct objfile *objfile, int typeid)

DESCRIPTION

	DWARF version 1 doesn't supply any fundamental type information,
	so gdb has to construct such types.  It has a fixed number of
	fundamental types that it knows how to construct, which is the
	union of all types that it knows how to construct for all languages
	that it knows about.  These are enumerated in gdbtypes.h.

	As an example, assume we find a DIE that references a DWARF
	fundamental type of FT_integer.  We first look in the ftypes
	array to see if we already have such a type, indexed by the
	gdb internal value of FT_INTEGER.  If so, we simply return a
	pointer to that type.  If not, then we ask an appropriate
	language dependent routine to create a type FT_INTEGER, using
	defaults reasonable for the current target machine, and install
	that type in ftypes for future reference.

RETURNS

	Pointer to a fundamental type.

GLOBAL FUNCTION

	dwarf_build_psymtabs -- build partial symtabs from DWARF debug info

SYNOPSIS

	void dwarf_build_psymtabs (struct objfile *objfile,
	     struct section_offsets *section_offsets,
	     int mainline, file_ptr dbfoff, unsigned int dbfsize,
	     file_ptr lnoffset, unsigned int lnsize)

DESCRIPTION

	This function is called upon to build partial symtabs from files
	containing DIE's (Dwarf Information Entries) and DWARF line numbers.

	It is passed a bfd* containing the DIES
	and line number information, the corresponding filename for that
	file, a base address for relocating the symbols, a flag indicating
	whether or not this debugging information is from a "main symbol
	table" rather than a shared library or dynamically linked file,
	and file offset/size pairs for the DIE information and line number
	information.

RETURNS

	No return value.

NOTES

	Note that we need to call struct_type regardless of whether or not
	the DIE has an at_name attribute, since it might be an anonymous
	structure or union.  This gets the type entered into our set of
	user defined types.

	However, if the structure is incomplete (an opaque struct/union)
	then suppress creating a symbol table entry for it since gdb only
	wants to find the one with the complete definition.  Note that if
	it is complete, we just call new_symbol, which does it's own
	checking about whether the struct/union is anonymous or not (and
	suppresses creating a symbol table entry itself).

LOCAL FUNCTION

	decode_subscript_data_item -- decode array subscript item

SYNOPSIS

	static struct type *
	decode_subscript_data_item (char *scan, char *end)

DESCRIPTION

	The array subscripts and the data type of the elements of an
	array are described by a list of data items, stored as a block
	of contiguous bytes.  There is a data item describing each array
	dimension, and a final data item describing the element type.
	The data items are ordered the same as their appearance in the
	source (I.E. leftmost dimension first, next to leftmost second,
	etc).

	The data items describing each array dimension consist of four
	parts: (1) a format specifier, (2) type type of the subscript
	index, (3) a description of the low bound of the array dimension,
	and (4) a description of the high bound of the array dimension.

	The last data item is the description of the type of each of
	the array elements.

	We are passed a pointer to the start of the block of bytes
	containing the remaining data items, and a pointer to the first
	byte past the data.  This function recursively decodes the
	remaining data items and returns a type.

	If we somehow fail to decode some data, we complain about it
	and return a type "array of int".

BUGS
	FIXME:  This code only implements the forms currently used
	by the AT&T and GNU C compilers.

	The end pointer is supplied for error checking, maybe we should
	use it for that...

	decode_line_numbers -- decode a line number table fragment

SYNOPSIS

	static void decode_line_numbers (char *tblscan, char *tblend,
		long length, long base, long line, long pc)

DESCRIPTION

	Translate the DWARF line number information to gdb form.

	The ".line" section contains one or more line number tables, one for
	each ".line" section from the objects that were linked.

	The AT_stmt_list attribute for each TAG_source_file entry in the
	".debug" section contains the offset into the ".line" section for the
	start of the table for that file.

	The table itself has the following structure:

	<table length><base address><source statement entry>
	4 bytes       4 bytes       10 bytes

	The table length is the total size of the table, including the 4 bytes
	for the length information.

	The base address is the address of the first instruction generated
	for the source file.

	Each source statement entry has the following structure:

	<line number><statement position><address delta>
	4 bytes      2 bytes             4 bytes

	The line number is relative to the start of the file, starting with
	line 1.

	The statement position either -1 (0xFFFF) or the number of characters
	from the beginning of the line to the beginning of the statement.

	The address delta is the difference between the base address and
	the address of the first instruction for the statement.

	Note that we must copy the bytes from the packed table to our local
	variables before attempting to use them, to avoid alignment problems
	on some machines, particularly RISC processors.

BUGS

	Does gdb expect the line numbers to be sorted?  They are now by
	chance/luck, but are not required to be.  (FIXME)

	The line with number 0 is unused, gdb apparently can discover the
	span of the last line some other way. How?  (FIXME)

	locval -- compute the value of a location attribute

SYNOPSIS

	static int locval (char *loc)

DESCRIPTION

	Given pointer to a string of bytes that define a location, compute
	the location and return the value.
	A location description containing no atoms indicates that the
	object is optimized out. The global optimized_out flag is set for
	those, the return value is meaningless.

	When computing values involving the current value of the frame pointer,
	the value zero is used, which results in a value relative to the frame
	pointer, rather than the absolute value.  This is what GDB wants
	anyway.
    
	When the result is a register number, the global isreg flag is set,
	otherwise it is cleared.  This is a kludge until we figure out a better
	way to handle the problem.  Gdb's design does not mesh well with the
	DWARF notion of a location computing interpreter, which is a shame
	because the flexibility goes unused.

NOTES

	Note that stack[0] is unused except as a default error return.
	Note that stack overflow is not yet handled.

	Don't attempt to add anonymous structures or unions since they have
	no name.  Anonymous enumerations however are processed, because we
	want to extract their member names (the check for a tag name is
	done later).

	Also, for variables and subroutines, check that this is the place
	where the actual definition occurs, rather than just a reference

LOCAL FUNCTION

	scan_compilation_units -- build a psymtab entry for each compilation

DESCRIPTION

	This is the top level dwarf parsing routine for building partial
	symbol tables.

	It scans from the beginning of the DWARF table looking for the first
	TAG_compile_unit DIE, and then follows the sibling chain to locate
	each additional TAG_compile_unit DIE.
   
	For each TAG_compile_unit DIE it creates a partial symtab structure,
	calls a subordinate routine to collect all the compilation unit's
	global DIE's, file scope DIEs, typedef DIEs, etc, and then links the
	new partial symtab structure into the partial symbol table.  It also
	records the appropriate information in the partial symbol table entry
	to allow the chunk of DIE's and line number table for this compilation
	unit to be located and re-read later, to generate a complete symbol
	table entry for the compilation unit.

	Thus it effectively partitions up a chunk of DIE's for multiple
	compilation units into smaller DIE chunks and line number tables,
	and associates them with a partial symbol table entry.

NOTES

	If any compilation unit has no line number table associated with
	it for some reason (a missing at_stmt_list attribute, rather than
	just one with a value of zero, which is valid) then we ensure that
	the recorded file offset is zero so that the routine which later
	reads line number table fragments knows that there is no fragment
	to read.

RETURNS

	Returns no value.

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

	Decode a modified type, either a modified fundamental type or
	a modified user defined type.  MODIFIERS is a pointer to the
	block of bytes that define MODCOUNT modifiers.  Immediately
	following the last modifier is a short containing the fundamental
	type or a long containing the reference to the user defined
	type.  Which one is determined by MTYPE, which is either
	AT_mod_fund_type or AT_mod_u_d_type to indicate what modified
	type we are generating.

	We call ourself recursively to generate each modified type,`
	until MODCOUNT reaches zero, at which point we have consumed
	all the modifiers and generate either the fundamental type or
	user defined type.  When the recursion unwinds, each modifier
	is applied in turn to generate the full modified type.

NOTES

	If we find a modifier that we don't recognize, and it is not one
	of those reserved for application specific use, then we issue a
	warning and simply ignore the modifier.

BUGS

	We currently ignore MOD_const and MOD_volatile.  (FIXME)

LOCAL FUNCTION

	basicdieinfo -- extract the minimal die info from raw die data

SYNOPSIS

	void basicdieinfo (char *diep, struct dieinfo *dip,
			   struct objfile *objfile)

DESCRIPTION

	Given a pointer to raw DIE data, and a pointer to an instance of a
	die info structure, this function extracts the basic information
	from the DIE data required to continue processing this DIE, along
	with some bookkeeping information about the DIE.

	The information we absolutely must have includes the DIE tag,
	and the DIE length.  If we need the sibling reference, then we
	will have to call completedieinfo() to process all the remaining
	DIE information.

	Note that since there is no guarantee that the data is properly
	aligned in memory for the type of access required (indirection
	through anything other than a char pointer), and there is no
	guarantee that it is in the same byte order as the gdb host,
	we call a function which deals with both alignment and byte
	swapping issues.  Possibly inefficient, but quite portable.

	We also take care of some other basic things at this point, such
	as ensuring that the instance of the die info structure starts
	out completely zero'd and that curdie is initialized for use
	in error reporting if we have a problem with the current die.

NOTES

	All DIE's must have at least a valid length, thus the minimum
	DIE size is SIZEOF_DIE_LENGTH.  In order to have a valid tag, the
	DIE size must be at least SIZEOF_DIE_TAG larger, otherwise they
	are forced to be TAG_padding DIES.

	Padding DIES must be at least SIZEOF_DIE_LENGTH in length, implying
	that if a padding DIE is used for alignment and the amount needed is
	less than SIZEOF_DIE_LENGTH, then the padding DIE has to be big
	enough to align to the next alignment boundry.

	We do some basic sanity checking here, such as verifying that the
	length of the die would not cause it to overrun the recorded end of
	the buffer holding the DIE info.  If we find a DIE that is either
	too small or too large, we force it's length to zero which should
	cause the caller to take appropriate action.

LOCAL FUNCTION

	target_to_host -- swap in target data to host

SYNOPSIS

	target_to_host (char *from, int nbytes, int signextend,
			struct objfile *objfile)

DESCRIPTION

	Given pointer to data in target format in FROM, a byte count for
	the size of the data in NBYTES, a flag indicating whether or not
	the data is signed in SIGNEXTEND, and a pointer to the current
	objfile in OBJFILE, convert the data to host format and return
	the converted value.

NOTES

	FIXME:  If we read data that is known to be signed, and expect to
	use it as signed data, then we need to explicitly sign extend the
	result until the bfd library is able to do this for us.

	FIXME: Would a 32 bit target ever need an 8 byte result?

   If you are looking for DWARF-2 support, you are in the wrong file.
   Go look in dwarf2read.c.  This file is for the original DWARF,
   also known as DWARF-1.

   DWARF-1 is slowly headed for obsoletion.

   In gcc HEAD 2003-11-29 16:28:31 UTC, no targets prefer dwarf-1.

   In gcc 3.3.2, these targets prefer dwarf-1:

     i[34567]86-sequent-ptx4*
     i[34567]86-sequent-sysv4*
     mips-sni-sysv4
     sparc-hal-solaris2*

     i[34567]86-sequent-sysv4*
     m88k-dg-dgux*
     mips-sni-sysv4

   Some non-gcc compilers produce dwarf-1: 

     PR gdb/1179 was from a user with Diab C++ 4.3.
     Other users have also reported using Diab compilers with dwarf-1.
     On 2003-06-09 the gdb list received a report from a user
       with Absoft ProFortran f77 which is dwarf-1.

   DWARF version 1 doesn't supply any fundamental type information,
   so gdb has to construct such types.  It has a fixed number of
   fundamental types that it knows how to construct, which is the

   As an example, assume we find a DIE that references a DWARF
   fundamental type of FT_integer.  We first look in the ftypes
   array to see if we already have such a type, indexed by the
   gdb internal value of FT_INTEGER.  If so, we simply return a
   pointer to that type.  If not, then we ask an appropriate
   language dependent routine to create a type FT_INTEGER, using
   defaults reasonable for the current target machine, and install
   that type in ftypes for future reference.

   NOTES

   Note that we need to call struct_type regardless of whether or not
   the DIE has an at_name attribute, since it might be an anonymous
   structure or union.  This gets the type entered into our set of
   user defined types.

   However, if the structure is incomplete (an opaque struct/union)
   then suppress creating a symbol table entry for it since gdb only
   wants to find the one with the complete definition.  Note that if
   it is complete, we just call new_symbol, which does it's own
   checking about whether the struct/union is anonymous or not (and
   suppresses creating a symbol table entry itself).

   DESCRIPTION

   The array subscripts and the data type of the elements of an
   array are described by a list of data items, stored as a block
   of contiguous bytes.  There is a data item describing each array
   dimension, and a final data item describing the element type.
   The data items are ordered the same as their appearance in the
   source (I.E. leftmost dimension first, next to leftmost second,
   etc).

   The data items describing each array dimension consist of four
   parts: (1) a format specifier, (2) type type of the subscript
   index, (3) a description of the low bound of the array dimension,
   and (4) a description of the high bound of the array dimension.
d1296 27
a1322 2
   The last data item is the description of the type of each of
   the array elements.
d1324 2
a1325 14
   We are passed a pointer to the start of the block of bytes
   containing the remaining data items, and a pointer to the first
   byte past the data.  This function recursively decodes the
   remaining data items and returns a type.

   If we somehow fail to decode some data, we complain about it
   and return a type "array of int".

   BUGS
   FIXME:  This code only implements the forms currently used
   by the AT&T and GNU C compilers.

   The end pointer is supplied for error checking, maybe we should
   use it for that...

   When the partial symbol table is built, the file offset for the line

   The line number is relative to the start of the file, starting with

   The statement position either -1 (0xFFFF) or the number of characters

   DESCRIPTION
d2193 16
a2208 5
   Given pointer to a string of bytes that define a location, compute
   the location and return the value.
   A location description containing no atoms indicates that the
   object is optimized out. The optimized_out flag is set for those,
   the return value is meaningless.
d2210 1
a2210 4
   When computing values involving the current value of the frame pointer,
   the value zero is used, which results in a value relative to the frame
   pointer, rather than the absolute value.  This is what GDB wants
   anyway.
d2212 2
a2213 10
   When the result is a register number, the isreg flag is set, otherwise
   it is cleared.  This is a kludge until we figure out a better
   way to handle the problem.  Gdb's design does not mesh well with the
   DWARF notion of a location computing interpreter, which is a shame
   because the flexibility goes unused.

   When expanding a partial symbol table entry to a full symbol table
   entry, this is the function that gets called to read in the symbols
   for the compilation unit.  A pointer to the newly constructed symtab,
   which is now the new first one on the objfile's symtab list, is
   stashed in the partial symbol table entry.

   DESCRIPTION
d2793 2
a2794 2
   This is the top level dwarf parsing routine for building partial
   symbol tables.
d2796 16
a2811 3
   It scans from the beginning of the DWARF table looking for the first
   TAG_compile_unit DIE, and then follows the sibling chain to locate
   each additional TAG_compile_unit DIE.
d2813 1
a2813 12
   For each TAG_compile_unit DIE it creates a partial symtab structure,
   calls a subordinate routine to collect all the compilation unit's
   global DIE's, file scope DIEs, typedef DIEs, etc, and then links the
   new partial symtab structure into the partial symbol table.  It also
   records the appropriate information in the partial symbol table entry
   to allow the chunk of DIE's and line number table for this compilation
   unit to be located and re-read later, to generate a complete symbol
   table entry for the compilation unit.

   Thus it effectively partitions up a chunk of DIE's for multiple
   compilation units into smaller DIE chunks and line number tables,
   and associates them with a partial symbol table entry.
d2815 6
a2820 1
   NOTES
d2822 1
a2822 6
   If any compilation unit has no line number table associated with
   it for some reason (a missing at_stmt_list attribute, rather than
   just one with a value of zero, which is valid) then we ensure that
   the recorded file offset is zero so that the routine which later
   reads line number table fragments knows that there is no fragment
   to read.

   Decode a modified type, either a modified fundamental type or

   following the last modifier is a short containing the fundamental
   type or a long containing the reference to the user defined

   type we are generating.

   We call ourself recursively to generate each modified type,`
   until MODCOUNT reaches zero, at which point we have consumed
   all the modifiers and generate either the fundamental type or

   is applied in turn to generate the full modified type.

   If the type is not in the range of those types defined as
   application specific types, we also issue a warning.

   DESCRIPTION
d3482 21
a3502 4
   Given a pointer to raw DIE data, and a pointer to an instance of a
   die info structure, this function extracts the basic information
   from the DIE data required to continue processing this DIE, along
   with some bookkeeping information about the DIE.
d3504 1
a3504 16
   The information we absolutely must have includes the DIE tag,
   and the DIE length.  If we need the sibling reference, then we
   will have to call completedieinfo() to process all the remaining
   DIE information.

   Note that since there is no guarantee that the data is properly
   aligned in memory for the type of access required (indirection
   through anything other than a char pointer), and there is no
   guarantee that it is in the same byte order as the gdb host,
   we call a function which deals with both alignment and byte
   swapping issues.  Possibly inefficient, but quite portable.

   We also take care of some other basic things at this point, such
   as ensuring that the instance of the die info structure starts
   out completely zero'd and that curdie is initialized for use
   in error reporting if we have a problem with the current die.
d3506 15
a3520 17
   NOTES

   All DIE's must have at least a valid length, thus the minimum
   DIE size is SIZEOF_DIE_LENGTH.  In order to have a valid tag, the
   DIE size must be at least SIZEOF_DIE_TAG larger, otherwise they
   are forced to be TAG_padding DIES.

   Padding DIES must be at least SIZEOF_DIE_LENGTH in length, implying
   that if a padding DIE is used for alignment and the amount needed is
   less than SIZEOF_DIE_LENGTH, then the padding DIE has to be big
   enough to align to the next alignment boundry.

   We do some basic sanity checking here, such as verifying that the
   length of the die would not cause it to overrun the recorded end of
   the buffer holding the DIE info.  If we find a DIE that is either
   too small or too large, we force it's length to zero which should
   cause the caller to take appropriate action.

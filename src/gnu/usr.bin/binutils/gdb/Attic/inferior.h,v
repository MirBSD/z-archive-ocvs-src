/* Nonzero means expecting a trap and caller will handle it
   themselves.  It is used when running in the shell before the child
   program has been exec'd; and when running some kinds of remote
   stuff (FIXME?).  */

/* It is also used after attach, due to attaching to a process. This
   is a bit trickier.  When doing an attach, the kernel stops the
   debuggee with a SIGSTOP.  On newer GNU/Linux kernels (>= 2.5.61)
   the handling of SIGSTOP for a ptraced process has changed. Earlier
   versions of the kernel would ignore these SIGSTOPs, while now
   SIGSTOP is treated like any other signal, i.e. it is not muffled.
   
   If the gdb user does a 'continue' after the 'attach', gdb passes
   the global variable stop_signal (which stores the signal from the
   attach, SIGSTOP) to the ptrace(PTRACE_CONT,...)  call.  This is
   problematic, because the kernel doesn't ignore such SIGSTOP
   now. I.e. it is reported back to gdb, which in turn presents it
   back to the user.
 
   To avoid the problem, we use STOP_QUIETLY_NO_SIGSTOP, which allows
   gdb to clear the value of stop_signal after the attach, so that it
   is not passed back down to the kernel.  */

/* Unless explicitly specified, GDB obstacks always use xmalloc() and
   xfree().  */
/* Note: ezannoni 2004-02-09: One could also specify the allocation
   functions using a special init function for each obstack,
   obstack_specify_allocation.  However we just use obstack_init and
   let these defines here do the job.  While one could argue the
   superiority of one approach over the other, we just chose one
   throughout.  */

/* This module provides three functions: dbx_symfile_init,
   which initializes to read a symbol file; dbx_new_init, which 
   discards existing cached information when all symbols are being
   discarded; and dbx_symfile_read, which reads a symbol table
   from a file.

   dbx_symfile_read only does the minimum work necessary for letting the
   user "name" things symbolically; it does not read the entire symtab.
   Instead, it reads the external and static symbols and puts them in partial
   symbol tables.  When more extensive information is requested of a
   file, the corresponding partial symbol table is mutated into a full
   fledged symbol table by going back and reading the symbols
   for real.  dbx_psymtab_to_symtab() is the function that does this */

     to global and static variables.  The stab for a global or static
     variable doesn't give us any indication of which section it's in,
     so we can't tell immediately which offset in
     objfile->section_offsets we should apply to the variable's
     address.

     We could certainly find out which section contains the variable
     by looking up the variable's unrelocated address with
     find_pc_section, but that would be expensive; this is the
     function that constructs the partial symbol tables by examining
     every symbol in the entire executable, and it's
     performance-critical.  So that expense would not be welcome.  I'm
     not sure what to do about this at the moment.

     What we have done for years is to simply assume that the .data
     section's offset is appropriate for all global and static
     variables.  Recently, this was expanded to fall back to the .bss
     section's offset if there is no .data section, and then to the

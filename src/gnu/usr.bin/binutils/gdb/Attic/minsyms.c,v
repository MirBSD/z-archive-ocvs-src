/* This file contains support routines for creating, manipulating, and
   destroying minimal symbol tables.

   Minimal symbol tables are used to hold some very basic information about
   all defined global symbols (text, data, bss, abs, etc).  The only two
   required pieces of information are the symbol's name and the address
   associated with that symbol.

   In many cases, even if a file was compiled with no special options for
   debugging at all, as long as was not stripped it will contain sufficient
   information to build useful minimal symbol tables using this structure.
   
   Even when a file contains enough debugging information to build a full
   symbol table, these minimal symbols are still useful for quickly mapping
   between names and addresses, and vice versa.  They are also sometimes used
   to figure out what full symbol table entries need to be read in. */

   usually contain at least two different types of symbol tables (a
   standard ELF one and a smaller dynamic linking table), as well as
   DWARF debugging information for files compiled with -g.

   Without compacting, the minimal symbol table for gdb itself contains
   over a 1000 duplicates, about a third of the total table size.  Aside
   from the potential trap of not noticing that two successive entries
   identify the same location, this duplication impacts the time required
   to linearly scan the table, which is done in a number of places.  So we
   just do one linear scan here and toss out the duplicates.

   Note that we are not concerned here about recovering the space that
   is potentially freed up, because the strings themselves are allocated
   on the symbol_obstack, and will get automatically freed when the symbol
   table is freed.  The caller can free up the unused minimal symbols at
   the end of the compacted region if their allocation strategy allows it.

   Also note we only go up to the next to last entry within the loop
   and then copy the last entry explicitly after the loop terminates.

   Since the different sources of information for each symbol may
   have different levels of "completeness", we may have duplicates
   that have one entry with type "mst_unknown" and the other with a
   known type.  So if the one we are leaving alone has type mst_unknown,
   overwrite its type with the type from the one we are compacting out.  */

/* Add the minimal symbols in the existing bunches to the objfile's official
   minimal symbol table.  In most cases there is no minimal symbol table yet
   for this objfile, and the existing bunches are used to create one.  Once
   in a while (for shared libraries for example), we add symbols (e.g. common
   symbols) to an existing objfile.

   Because of the way minimal symbols are collected, we generally have no way
   of knowing what source language applies to any particular minimal symbol.
   Specifically, we have no way of knowing if the minimal symbol comes from a
   C++ compilation unit or not.  So for the sake of supporting cached
   demangled C++ names, we have no choice but to try and demangle each new one
   that comes in.  If the demangling succeeds, then we assume it is a C++
   symbol and set the symbol's language and demangled name fields
   appropriately.  Note that in order to avoid unnecessary demanglings, and
   allocating obstack space that subsequently can't be freed for the demangled
   names, we mark all newly added symbols with language_auto.  After
   compaction of the minimal symbols, we go back and scan the entire minimal
   symbol table looking for these new symbols.  For each new symbol we attempt
   to demangle it, and if successful, record it as a language_cplus symbol
   and cache the demangled form on the symbol obstack.  Symbols which don't
   demangle are marked as language_unknown symbols, which inhibits future
   attempts to demangle them if we later add more minimal symbols. */

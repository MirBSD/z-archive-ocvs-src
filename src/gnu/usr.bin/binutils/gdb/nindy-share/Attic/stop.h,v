@first foolish attempt to merge the last piece
won't probably work, but I want it backed up,
since there's a lot of work and time in it

/******************************************************************
 *
 *   REASONS WHY NINDY CAN STOP EXECUTING AN APPLICATION PROGRAM
 *
 * When NINDY stops executing an application program that was running
 * under remote host ("gdb") control, it signals the host by sending
 * a single ^P.  The host can then query as to the reason for the halt.
 * NINDY responds with two bytes of information.
 *
 * The first byte is a boolean flag that indicates whether or not
 * the application has exited.
 *
 * If the flag is true, the second byte contains the exit code.
 *
 * If the flag is false, the second byte contains a "reason for
 * stopping" code.  This file defines the possible values of that
 * code.
 *
 * There are three categories of reasons why the halt may have occurred:
 * faults, traces, and software interactions.  The first two categories
 * are processor-dependent; the values of these codes are tightly coupled
 * to the hardware and should not be changed without first examining
 * src/nindy/common/fault.c.  The software interactions involve
 * communication between NINDY and the host debugger;  their codes are
 * arbitrary.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

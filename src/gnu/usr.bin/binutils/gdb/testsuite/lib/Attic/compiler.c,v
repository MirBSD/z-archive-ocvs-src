/* Sometimes the behavior of a test depends upon the compiler used to
   compile the test program.  A test script can call get_compiler_info
   to figure out the compiler version and test_compiler_info to test it.

   get_compiler_info runs the preprocessor on this file and then eval's
   the result.  This sets various symbols for use by test_compiler_info.

   TODO: make compiler_info a local variable for get_compiler_info and
   test_compiler_info.

   TODO: all clients should use test_compiler_info and should not
   use gcc_compiled, hp_cc_compiler, or hp_aCC_compiler.

   TODO: purge signed_keyword_not_used.  */

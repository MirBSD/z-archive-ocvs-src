# Tests a bug with ui-out and nested uiout types. When 
# an error is encountered building a nest typed, like
# lists or tuples, the uiout is not reset to some sane
# state. As a result, uiout still thinks it is building
# this nested type. Execute enough of these errors and
# an assertion failure occurs. This is most obvious
# with invalid register number and the register commands.

# MAX_UIOUT_LEVELS is set to 5.

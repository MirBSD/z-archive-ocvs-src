@/* This program is intended to be started outside of gdb, and then
   attached to by gdb.  Thus, it simply spins in a loop.  The loop
   is exited when & if the variable 'should_exit' is non-zero.  (It
   is initialized to zero in this program, so the loop will never
   exit unless/until gdb sets the variable to non-zero.)

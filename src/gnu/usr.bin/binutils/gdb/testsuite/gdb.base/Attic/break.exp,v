# Add a second pass pattern.  The behavior differs here between stabs
# and dwarf for one-line functions.  Stabs preserves two line symbols
# (one before the prologue and one after) with the same line number, 
# but dwarf regards these as duplicates and discards one of them.
# Therefore the address after the prologue (where the breakpoint is)
# has no exactly matching line symbol, and GDB reports the breakpoint
# as if it were in the middle of a line rather than at the beginning.

@first foolish attempt to merge the last piece
won't probably work, but I want it backed up,
since there's a lot of work and time in it

# When SIGFPE happens, the operating system may restart the
# offending instruction after the signal handler returns,
# rather than proceeding to the next instruction.  This happens
# on i686-pc-linux-gnu with a linux kernel.  If gdb has a naive
# signal handler that just returns, then it will restart the
# broken instruction and gdb gets an endless stream of SIGFPE's
# and makes no progress.
#
# On a broken gdb this test will just time out.

The libgcj library is licensed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from
or based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend
this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this
exception statement from your version.

@The usual clean sweep:
o Move GNU licenses out of the subdirectories,
  install them once instead
o Update GNU licenses with their latest versions
  from the gcc-3.3 package
o libz (zlib) is included in the base system
o ChangeLog files get removed; they remain accessible
  by cvsweb. Local changes are documented by cvs commits.
o Remove VMS, DOS, Macintosh etc. files

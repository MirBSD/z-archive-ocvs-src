@Mostly... not fully...

One weekend's worth of work.

- catch up website log with changes really done till today
- add catch-up entries for wbx@@ and bsiegert@@, too
- move GNU documentation to src/gnu/doc and simplify it
- re-run autoconf on the gnu part of the tree again, to
  catch up with the GFDL-documentation removal
- provide non-GFDL-licenced as(1) and ld(1) manual pages
  XXX these are more than outdated!
- bump MirOS patchlevel
- build the system through, fixing showstoppers where
  they are encountered
- index.cgi and index.php come before index.htm,
  default.htm and index.html in httpd.conf
- speed up PHP processing
- prepare for "new" OpenBSD pkgtools (unsupported by MirBSD,
  but some MirPorts people want to play with them)
- move old weblog to CMS; update my info again
- update hRef""s in old weblogs
- move release announcements to /historic/
- copy feature list from last release announcement
  XXX need a "readible short list", or even
  XXX	a separation for the target environment
  XXX	(e.g. suits / techies / clients)
- add some recent news, so the page ain't empty
  missing:
	- about
	  + MirOS
	  + MirPorts
	- get MirOS!	(http d/l, http install, install docs)
	- relations	(to other BSD)
	  + ??? events ??? (here?)
	- history
	- older releases	(historic)
	- help pages
	  + FAQ
	  + Docs/Tuts	(hi wbx@@ here comes your place)
	    + install docs
	  + mailing lists
	- developers
	  + wbx
	  + bsiegert
	  + cnuke
	- CVSweb	(XXX need BSDadvocacy.org fix before)
	- AnonCVS	(howto; link to)
	- Links
  alternatively, change the layout? suggestions?
  why am I the only one who cares about www?
- merge development plan
- put a "project" into the miros page head
- fix cdboot Makefile
- fix gas wanting us a.out again (wut?)
  (turned out to be a must-fix in configure.in)
- stand/cdboot/NOTES merged into stand/README
- sync distrib set lists
- have TORI device (i386 libsa) always use bounce buffers
  (which, in fact, makes it succeed in loading the kernel)
  XXX kernel says it has less than 4 meg ram (degraded mode)
  XXX may be a bochs issue?
- fix random.S again
- move determining of file name / raw file flag in both
  bios/toridev.c to the end of bios/toriopen()
  => enables us to have two drivers at once
- fix disk probing for CD devices wrt BIOS driver

(eww. The tree isn't fully broken, but neither boot
 nor cdboot.bin are usable at all at the moment.
 I'll fix that ASAP.)

Some of the software in this subtree follows special rules.

Specifically, the FSF not only wants the GPL licence, but they
also insist that you assign your copyright to the FSF for anything
but trivial changes.

So:
- check the history of external code before importing it.
- be ready to arrange for copyright papers somewhat in advance if
you want to work on it (the FSF takes a few months to process these).

Otherwise, changes might not make it to the main distribution, and may
need some further maintenance over time, or risk getting lost.

Some internal changes are acceptable, but OpenBSD can't afford to maintain
a complete separate toolchain on its own.

----

MirBSD particulars:

Every single GNU-licensed (GPL, LGPL, etc.) file in this directory
is covered by the licence in the lowest possible version that is
written in the file, and relicensing files taken from MirBSD under
later versions of e.g. the GPL (when the original file is, say,
GPLv1'd) is prohibited, unless you ask me. I decide this on a case
by case base.
The same goes for the NPL (Netscape Public License) dict(1) is under.

Please notice that we can't modify GNU "Free Documentation License"
covered text segments, unless the documents in question have neither
"invariant sections" nor "front/back cover texts", which renders these
files unfree, thusly we can't distribute them.
Update: see the file src/gnu/gcc/README.MirOS for more details.
This is a consensus that has been discussed on the debian-legal mailing
list. MirBSD, MirLinux strike to be DFSG-free operating systems, with
MirPorts being only a defined way to locally add third-party packages,
thus we took the consequence and removed GFDL-licenced documentation
from the installed base system and, where feasible, from the source.

About GPL compliance:
 https://MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org:8890/active/cvsweb.cgi/src/gnu/ChangeLog
(if you get a 500 Internal Server Error, please contact <x86@@ePost.de>,
 it's a known CVS bug, and I already know how to fix it)

@Yours sincerely, licence auditor, strikes again.


Remove stuff under the so-called "GNU Free Documentation License".

You are actually even breaching the licence when you are
storing GFDL-licenced documents on an encrypted filesystem,
or "even  storing  it  on  a  file-sharing  system  with
non-world-readable permissions", according to the information
found at http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html
via Slashdot.

I am thinking whether to adopt the (amended) Debian Social
Contract, and either the DFSG or the OSD (or both) for MirOS.
(see the /. story)

src/gnu/libstdc++:

| The Docs: FDL
|
|    The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
|    web,   including   the  pages  generated  from  source  comments,  are
|    copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation, and placed under the
|    [3]GNU   Free   Documentation   License  version  1.1.  There  are  no
|    Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and no Invariant Sections.

Of course this doesn't apply to documentation for libstdc++ generated by
ourselfes from GPL'd or LGPL'd files, because the GFDL is incompatible
with both of them.


Hint: if you can dig out older versions of the GNU tools man pages, such
as gcc 3.0 and binutils 2.12/2.13 (for example), which are not yet GFDL
licenced, please give me a hint (I'm not actively searching myself now)
or mail them to me, and be sure I'll commit them, together with a warning
about inactuality.

@license sweep in gnu:
 - GPL, LGPL and friends:
	Programmes often allow "version blah or any later version".
	This leads to problems, if a later version is unfree. That's
	why each file in GNU is considered a "derived work" from the
	upstream version now, with that clause removed - i.e. you can't
	distribute tinyirc with GPL version 2, for example (unless it
	links against a GPL2'd lib, but then you still won't be able
	to apply a fictional GPLv3).
 - GFDL:
	Refer to the thread on debian-legal, which got attention by
	slashdot. If a GFDL-licensed document contains "invariant
	sections" or "cover texts", it is unfree. That's why some of
	our documentation had to go out. Sorry, GNU folks, but MirBSD
	does not play with your politics - neither would I do with
	Theo's, though you can't call that politics, more policies...

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

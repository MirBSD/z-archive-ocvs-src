@not-so-easy merge
note: the release process is currently marked as broken, because
the install.sub file needs some major fixes.
they are so major I'll eventually rewrite the stuff now. let's see.

1.1.1.1
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

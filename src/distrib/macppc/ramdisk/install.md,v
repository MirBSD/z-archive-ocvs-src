If you want to have a different setup, exit 'install' now and do the MBR

the Apple software, the "Unused" section must be changed to type "OpenBSD" name
"OpenBSD" using the pdisk tool contained on this ramdisk. The disklabel can
then be edited normally.

Disk partition sizes and offsets are in sector (most likely 512 bytes) units.
You may set these size/offset pairs on cylinder boundaries
     (the number of sector per cylinder is given in )
     (the 'sectors/cylinder' entry, which is not shown here)
Also, you *must* make sure that the 'i' partition points at the MSDOS partition
that will be used for booting. The 'c' partition shall start at offset 0 and
include the entire disk. This is most likely correct when you see the default
label in the editor.

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.

A valid MBR for an OpenBSD bootable disk must contain at least:
d195 3
a197 4
a) One DOS (id '06') partition at least 1MB in size. This is where OpenFirmware
will look for the 'ofwboot' program used to boot OpenBSD. Consult your PowerPC
OpenFirmware manual -and- the INSTALL.$ARCH file for directions on setting up
this partition correctly.

b) One OpenBSD (id 'A6') partition.

Please take note of the offsets and sizes of the DOS partition, the OpenBSD
partition, and any other partitions you want to access from OpenBSD. You will
need this information to fill in the OpenBSD disklabel.

You must modify an existing partition to be of type "OpenBSD" and have the name
"OpenBSD". If the partition does not exist you must create it with the Apple
MacOS tools before attempting to install OpenBSD.

You *MUST* setup the OpenBSD disklabel to include the MSDOS-formatted boot
partition as the 'i' partition. If the 'i' partition is missing or not the
MSDOS-formatted boot partition, then the 'ofwboot' file required to boot
OpenBSD cannot be installed.

To boot OpenBSD, the 'ofwboot' program must be present in the first HFS
partition of $ROOTDISK. If it is not currently present you must boot MacOS and
use MacOS tools to copy it from the OpenBSD install media. Then reboot the
machine.
d294 12

d309 1
d312 2

Once the machine has rebooted use OpenFirmware to boot into OpenBSD, as
described in the INSTALL.$ARCH document. The command to boot OpenBSD will be
something like 'boot hd:,ofwboot /bsd'.

@About MirBSD
============

MirBSD is not a project, it is, by definition, the contents of _my_ /usr/src
and /usr/ports directories. I am Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser, nice to meet
you. I hope to be able to help you by making this public.

This is MirOS BSD, a community-developed successor of MirBSD®.

This directory should contain checksums of the install tarballs as well.


MirBSD Licence (in addition to OpenBSD)
---------------------------------------

Copyright (c) 1982-2003 Thorsten Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

Subject to these terms, everybody who obtained a copy of this work
is hereby permitted to deal in the work without restriction inclu-
ding without limitation the rights to use, distribute, sell, modi-
fy, publically perform, give away, merge or sublicense it provided
this notice is kept and the authors and contributors are given due
credit in derivates or accompanying documents.
This work is provided "as is" with no explicit or implicit warran-
ties whatsoever to the maximum extend permitted by applicable law;
in no event may an author or contributor be held liable for damage
that is, directly or indirectly, caused by the work, even if advi-
sed of the possibility of such damage.


To the maximum extent of my knowledge, MirBSD is free for non-com-
mercial use, and maybe free for commercial use. Redistribution of
several parts of the system may require additional arrangements,
such as supplying the source code with redistributions. Some parts
of the system are covered by different licenses, such as the GNU
GPL, LGPL, FDL, and the Sendmail license. You are responsible by
yourself to read and comply with these terms if you intend redis-
tribution. To the maximum extent of my knowledge, MirBSD is free
from code that is intended to do damage, though due to the implied
error-prone-ness of software, code can be mis-used, so usage of
MirBSD is at your own risk.


MirBSD supplements

other strings attached with MirBSD.

Some of the supplied software is covered by GNU licences. The source

@About MirBSD
============

MirBSD is not a project, it is, by definition, the contents of _my_
/usr/src and /usr/ports directories. I am Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser,
nice to meet you. I hope to be able to help you by making this project
available to the general public.

This is MirOS BSD, a community-developed successor of MirBSD®, developed
by a few individuals around the world (mostly Europe, but also Canada
and the rest of America). MirOS is open source software, although not
OSI certified open source software (which is a trademark of The Open
Source Initiative).

If this is a boot image for a MirOS development snapshot, just boot
from the CD and start hacking. Please be sure to report problems, and
consider to send unified diffs for stuff you fixed.

If this is a formal release, the directory where you are reading this
file from also contains checksums of the installation sets (*.ngz) and
kernels (bsd*). You can check them from within the installation, and
verify the checksums with a PGP-2.6.3ia or PGP-2.6.3in compatible tool.

intend redistribution. To the maximum extent of our knowledge, MirOS
is free from code that is intended to do damage, though due to the
implied error-prone-ness and complexity of software as well as the
sheer size of the MirOS operating environment and MirPorts framework,
code can be mis-used, so usage of MirOS/MirPorts is at your own risk.

@Actually, repair this brain-damage I invented when I
tried to enable building on R/O /usr/src yesterday
late night.
This is the exact version of the code that was used
to build the new snapshot.

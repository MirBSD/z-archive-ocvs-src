@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@dnl	$OpenBSD: hardware,v 1.63 2004/03/26 08:56:10 tom Exp $
MirBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
    * sun4: the VME series
	- 4/100: Original sparc with VME. Many hardware bugs.
	- 4/200: A fairly decent VME-only machine
	- 4/300: a 25MHz VME machine with many devices built onto the main
	  board. In other respects, it is quite similar to the SS1+.

    * sun4c:
    	- SS1: the original 20MHz sun4c. Hardware limitations prevent SBus
	  DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- SS1+: 25MHz version of the above. Hardware limitations prevent
	  SBus DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- IPC: SS1+ in a cube, with bwtwo graphics builtin
	- SLC: SS1+ built into a B&W monitor
	- SS2: 40MHz version of the SS1
	- IPX: SS2 in a cube, with cgsix graphics builtin
	- ELC: SS2-performance built into a B&W monitor

    * sun4m:
	- 600MP: The original Sun4m machine. This is an mbus machine with
	  SBus and VME busses.
	- LC: 50MHz MicroSPARC-1 based machines (aka Classic)
	- LX: LC with a few more devices
	- SS4: Reduced cost version of the SS5, available at 70MHz and
	  110MHz
	- SS5: MicroSPARC-2 based machines available in 60, 70, 85, and 110
	  MHz versions
	- SS5: TurboSPARC cpus in accelerated SS5 machines, running at
	  170MHz
	- SS10: Pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- SS20: Improved pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- Sun Voyager

    * As well as faithful clones of the above Sun systems, such as:
	- Aries Research Inc, Parrot II (SS2 clone)
	- Axil 243 and 245 (and possibly other models) (SS5 clones)
	- Axil 320 (SS20 clone)
	- Opus 5000 (SS1 clone)
	- Opus 5250 (SS1 clone)
	- SPARCbook 3, 3GS, 3GX, 3TX and 3XP by Tadpole (MicroSPARC-2)
	- CPU5V: VME card by Force Computer (sun4m)
	- TWS,SuperCOMPstation-20S (SS20 clone)
	- Tatung micro COMPstation 5 (SS5 clone)
	- Tatung micro COMPstation LX (LX clone)
	- RDI,PowerLite: sun4m models, available in 50, 85 and 110 MHz
	- RDI,BrideLite
	- DTKstation/Classic+
	- Transtec SS5/170

For sun4m machines, the following mbus CPU modules are supported:
	- SM30: 30 or 36 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM40: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM41: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with 1 MB of secondary cache
	- SM50: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM51: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 1 MB of secondary cache
	- SM51-2: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 2 MB of secondary cache
	- SM61: 60 MHz SuperSPARC with 1 MB of secondary cache
	- SM61-2: 60 MHz SuperSPARC with 2 MB of secondary cache
	- SM71: 75 MHz SuperSPARC with 1 MB of secondary cache
	- SM81: 85 MHz SuperSPARC with 1 MB of secondary cache
	- SM81-2: 85 MHz SuperSPARC with 2 MB of secondary cache
	- SM100: dual 40 MHz Cypress 7C601 with 64 KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 90 MHz, with 256 KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 125 MHz, with 256 KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 150 MHz, with 512 KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 166 MHz, with 512 KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 180 MHz, with 512 KB of primary cache

The minimal configuration requires 4MB of RAM and ~60MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 6MB of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4MB of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8MB of RAM.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
    * Sun keyboard and mouse
    	- Type 2, 3, 4, and 5 keyboards with several layouts

	- Force system configuration registers (scf)
	- Force flash memory (flash)
	- Tadpole microcontroller (power/system control) (tctrl)
	- Prestoserve NVRAM Sbus cards (limited support) (presto)

MirBSD/MACHINE OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun 4/400
		Lacking support for the I/O cache, and related
		Ethernet problems.
	- sun4d -- SPARCcenter 2000, SPARCserver 1000
		XDBus and multiprocessor support issues.
	- sun4u (UltraSPARCs)
		These machines are supported by the OpenBSD/sparc64 port.
	- clones that are significantly different from the Sun systems
		(e.g. K-Bus based Solbourne)

Hardware that we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
    * Serial Cards:
        - VME mti 16-port serial card
        - VME alm2 16-port serial card
        - VME mcp 4-port serial card (or is it 8-port)
    * Disk Controllers:
        - VME "sc" SCSI controller
        - VME IPI controller
    * Framebuffers:
        - VME cgfive, 8-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	  unaccelerated without GP/GP2
        - VME cgnine, 24-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	  unaccelerated without GP/GP2
        - VME GP/GP2 Graphics Processor (drives a cgfive or cgnine)
        - SBus cgeight, 24-bit color, unaccelerated
        - SBus GT, 24-bit color, 8-bit color, overlay planes,
	  double-buffered, 3-D acceleration (aka "Graphics Tower")
    * On-board Audio and ISDN
	This is present on some sun4m systems (LX, LC, SPARCstation 10/20)
    * Multiple Processors/Modules in sun4m systems
	MirBSD will not currently boot on some machines with multiple
	processors. You must remove the extra CPUs.
    * SBus SUNW,bpp (parallel port)
    * SBus FAS SCSI controllers
	The FAS-only card is not supported. The HME+FAS card only supports
	the HME part of the card.
    * SBus FDDI cards

The supplied GENERIC kernel is the best attempt at a configuration that
works on the widest range of machines (sun4, sun4c, and sun4m).

RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8M of RAM.

If you have problems with the OpenBSD OSREV kernel in this distribution,
please visit the OpenBSD web page (http://www.openbsd.org) and the mailing
lists to review the current status and check for updates and distribution
errata.

If you have Sparc hardware you can donate or make available at nominal
cost, please mention this on the lists, many things aren't being tested
or developed simply because developers usually have only a Sparcstation
at hand, not an array of systems.  Donation or mid/long term loan of
UltraSparc (sun4u) or HyperSparc (sun4m) systems would help ensure the
long-term viability of OpenBSD on Sparc based systems.

Your support in terms of documenting previously unknown problems with
OpenBSD/MACHINE, helping debug known problems, implementing missing pieces,
and testing OpenBSD on various architectures is actively encouraged.
The OpenBSD mailing lists, web-pages and sendbug utility are your best
tools for helping make OpenBSD/MACHINE a better release.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4MB of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4MB of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8MB of RAM.

@dnl	$OpenBSD: install,v 1.18 2003/01/04 00:18:08 miod Exp $
OpenBSDInstallPrelude

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that can
be booted from tape.

Alternatively, if your MACHINE is hooked up in a network you can find a server
to arrange for a diskless setup, which is a convenient way to install on a
machine whose disk does not currently hold a usable operating system.
This is difficult to get set up correctly the first time, but easy to
use afterwards.  (see ``Installing using a diskless setup'' below).


Booting from the Installation Media:

Prior to attempting an installation, you should make sure that everything
of value on the target system has been backed up.  While installing OpenBSD
does not necessarily wipe out all the partitions on the hard disk, errors
during the install process can have unforeseen consequences and you will
probably render the system unbootable if you start, but do not complete
the installation.  Having the installation media for the prior installation,
like a Motorola SystemV/MACHINE tape is good insurance if you want to be
able to "go back" for some reason.

After taking care of all that, bring your system down gracefully using
the shutdown(8) and/or halt(8) commands.  This will get you to the BUG
prompt.


Booting from SCSI tape:

After creating the boot tape, boot it by typing the appropriate command
at the PROM:

	167-bug> bo xx yy

Where `xx' is the SCSI controller number (00 for the built-in SCSI
controller), and `yy' is ten times the tape drive ID, except for the
MVME147, where `xx' should be the tape drive ID, and `yy' should be 00.

For example, booting from a tape drive using SCSI id 4:
	147-bug> bo 04 00
for a MVME147, and
	167-bug> bo 00 40
for any other MACHINE board.


Installing using a diskless setup:

First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at the
diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it (on SunOS systems, add_client(8) and
the Sun System/Networks administrators guide constitute a good start;
on Solaris systems, share(1M) is a good starting point as well).

You should then setup your workstation using the NIOT command at the BUG
prompt. The Load Address should be 0x3F0000, and the Execution Address
should be 0x3F0000 as well. You may now boot your workstation from the
server by entering the NBO command at the BUG prompt:
	
	167-bug> nbo 00 00 bsd.rd

If your BUG version does not understand the NIOT and NBO commands (most
MVME147 don't), you will have to boot via S-Records.


Booting from S-Records:

First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at the
diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it (on SunOS systems, add_client(8) and
the Sun System/Networks administrators guide constitute a good start;
on Solaris systems, share(1M) is a good starting point as well).

Second, make sure you use a terminal emulator able to read files from the
local machine and send their contents over the serial link. OpenBSD ships
with both cu(1) and tip(1), but others can be used.

After reseting your MACHINE board, enter "LO" at the BUG prompt. If you get
an error message, switch directories (enter "SD") and retry. The MACHINE
should be awaiting a S-Record program now.

From your terminal emulator, send the contents of the ``sboot'' file over
the line. Depending on the speed of the serial link, this will take some
time, but no more than a couple of minutes.

If you don't get a prompt back after a few minutes, send a break, reset
your MACHINE board, and retry.

When the transfer is finished, enter "GO" at the BUG prompt.  The S-Records
boot loader will start.  This is a very crude bootloader which will attempt
to fetch a secondary boot program via TFTP requests, like the NBO command.

This will cause the kernel provided by the diskless setup to be booted.
After the initial probe messages you'll asked to start the install
or upgrade procedure.



Installing using the tape or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a floppy
	or slow network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If
	some action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has
	stopped and nothing further has happened, either your boot media
	is bad, your diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have
	a hardware or configuration problem.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	While booting, you will probably see several warnings.  You
	may be warned that the kernel can't figure out what device
	it booted from.  Do not be alarmed, this is completely normal.
	This warning occurs because while OpenBSD/MACHINE can boot from
	the floppy drive, the kernel itself lacks a floppy driver for some
	MACHINE models.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  You should choose
	the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).

Net Boot or Diskless Setup Information:

The set up is similar to SunOS diskless setup, but not identical, because
the Sun setup assumes that the bootblocks load a kernel image, which then
uses NFS to access the exported root partition, while the OpenBSD bootblocks
use internal NFS routines to load the kernel image directly from the
exported root partition.

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since
there is a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and
configured correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8)
manpage, find someone who's been through it before and use the host
syslog and tcpdump(8) to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your MACHINE expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address followed by the machine's architecture, separated
by a period. For example, a MACHINE board which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for `8273900B.MACHINE'.
Normally, this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).

You can find the boot program in `/usr/mdec/netboot' in the OpenBSD/MACHINE
distribution.

After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the BUG, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.

Unpack `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' on the server in the root directory
for your target machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and
the install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/MACHINE.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

Now you must populate the `/dev' directory for your client. If the server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to `<root>/dev'
and run the MAKEDEV script: `sh MAKEDEV all' (this might require the edition
of MAKEDEV to change the PATH for it to work properly).

On SunOS 5.x systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be error
messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are inconsequential
for the purpose of installing OpenBSD. However, you may want to correct them
if you plan to the diskless setup regularly. In that case, you may re-run
MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD machine once it has booted.

controller), and `yy' is the encoding for the SCSI device ID, which varies

a44 27
Recent BUG can list the available disk and tape controllers, using the
"IOT;H" command:

    167-Bug>IOT;H
    I/O Controllers Available:
    CLUN  CNTRL-TYPE  CNTRL-Address  N-Devices
       0  VME167      $FFF47000      *
       6  VME328      $FFFF9000      *

In this example, the built-in controller, as well as an external MVME328
controller, are available.

The encoding for the drive ID is as follows:
- built-in controller and MVME327 SCSI controller:
    'yy' is ten times the device ID.
- MVME328 SCSI controller:
    'yy' is eight times the devic ID, written in hexadecimal
- MVME350 tape controller:
    'yy' is always zero, as this controller only supports one tape drive.

MVME147 boards are slightly different, as they only support booting from
the built-in SCSI controller (if present), using the following convention:
- 'xx' is the device ID.
- 'yy' is zero.

For example, booting from a tape drive using SCSI ID #4:
    147-Bug> BO 04 00
d46 2
a47 7
    167-Bug> BO 00 40
for any other MACHINE board using the built-in controller. However, a tape
drive connected to an MVME328 board using SCSI ID #5, will be booted as:
    167-Bug> BO 06 28

Note that OpenBSD/MACHINE can boot off any tape drive supported by the BUG,
even if its controller is not supported by OpenBSD.
d62 6
a67 88
OpenBSD/MACHINE can boot off any network card supported by the BUG, even
if the card itself is not supported by OpenBSD. The list of BUG-supported
network controllers is available with the "NIOT;A" command. For example:

    167-Bug> NIOT;A
    Network Controllers/Nodes Supported
    CLUN  DLUN  Name      Address
       0     0  VME167    $FFF46000
       2     0  VME376    $FFFF1200
       3     0  VME376    $FFFF1400
       4     0  VME376    $FFFF1600
       5     0  VME376    $FFFF5400
       6     0  VME376    $FFFF5600
       7     0  VME376    $FFFFA400
      10     0  VME374    $FF000000
      11     0  VME374    $FF100000
      12     0  VME374    $FF200000
      13     0  VME374    $FF300000
      14     0  VME374    $FF400000
      15     0  VME374    $FF500000

The "NIOT;H" lists only the available controllers in the machine. For
example, if no external network card is present, only the built-in
controller will be reported:

    167-Bug> NIOT;A
    Network Controllers/Nodes Available
    CLUN  DLUN  Name      Address
       0     0  VME167    $FFF46000

If the BUG does not support the NIOT command (most MVME147 don't), then
it has no support for netbooting, and you'll have to use S-Records,
described later in this document.

Before netbooting, enter "NIOT" and fill the parametrs. Be sure to provide
the correct values for Controller LUN and Device LUN (as listed in the
"NIOT;A" output); also the "Boot File Load Address" and "Boot File
Execution Address" need to be set to 006F0000. The "Boot File Name" must
match the name of the netboot file on the server (copying it as
"netboot.mvme68k" is usually a wise choice). Finally, "Argument File Name"
needs to be set to "bsd.rd" in order to boot the installation miniroot,
rather than the regular kernel.

Here are acceptable values for a 167 card using the built-in controller:

    167-Bug> NIOT
    Controller LUN =00? 
    Device LUN     =00? 
    Node Control Memory Address =01FF0000? 
    Client IP Address      =0.0.0.0? 
    Server IP Address      =0.0.0.0? 
    Subnet IP Address Mask =255.255.255.0? 
    Broadcast IP Address   =255.255.255.255? 
    Gateway IP Address     =0.0.0.0? 
    Boot File Name ("NULL" for None)     =? netboot.mvme68k
    Argument File Name ("NULL" for None) =? bsd.rd
    Boot File Load Address         =001F0000? 006F0000
    Boot File Execution Address    =001F0000? 006F0000
    Boot File Execution Delay      =00000000? 
    Boot File Length               =00000000? 
    Boot File Byte Offset          =00000000? 
    BOOTP/RARP Request Retry       =00? 
    TFTP/ARP Request Retry         =00? 
    Trace Character Buffer Address =00000000? 
    BOOTP/RARP Request Control: Always/When-Needed (A/W)=W? 
    BOOTP/RARP Reply Update Control: Yes/No (Y/N)       =Y? 

If you change the NIOT configuration, you will be asked whether you want to
make these changes permanent. Do not answer Y unless you plan to netboot
this board very often; be sure to have the ENV settings use a correct
address for the NIOT parameters block in this case. A valid setting is:

    Network Auto Boot Configuration Parameters Pointer (NVRAM) =
        00000000? FFFC0080

for example.

Once the NIOT parameters are set, it should be possible to boot the machine
from the server with the NBO command. However, in some cases, netbooting
will prevent the OpenBSD kernel from probing the built-in SCSI controller
(if any) properly, so it is recommended to do a disk probe first:

    167-Bug> IOI;C
    167-Bug> IOI

This can take up to a couple of minutes, depending how many SCSI controllers
are found in the machine. Once the BUG prompt is back, you can safely
netboot:
d69 1
a69 10
    167-Bug> NBO 00 00

or if you know the IP address for the MACHINE and the diskless server,
you can directly provide the boot loader's filename and the kernel name
on the commandline:

     167-Bug> NBO 00 00 192.168.0.68 192.168.0.1 netboot.mvme68k bsd.rd

where, in this example, 192.168.0.68 is the address of the MACHINE computer,
and 192.168.0.1 the address of the diskless server.

instructed to boot "over the net". If you are booting from S-Records, it
will look for a filename composed of the machine's IP address, followed by
the machine's architecture, separated by a period (for example, a MACHINE
board which has been assigned IP address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP

you can specify the filename which will be looked for.

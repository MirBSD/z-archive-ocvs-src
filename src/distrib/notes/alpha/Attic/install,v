dnl XXX document mopbooting from the SRM console.
dnl XXX check if recent SRM console still can netboot, and if so, if they
dnl XXX still use mop or a more recent protocol.
There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way
is to boot from the OpenBSD CD-ROM.  You can also use one of the OpenBSD
installation floppies, if your machine has a floppy drive.

Booting from Floppy Disk installation media:

	At the SRM console prompt, enter
		boot dva0
	You should see info about the primary and secondary boot
	and then the kernel should start to load.  It will take a
	while to load the kernel from the floppy, most likely more
	than a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen,
	or the spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has
	happened, or the machine spontaneously reboots, then either
	either you have a bad boot floppy (in which case you should
	try another) or your alpha is not currently supported by OpenBSD.

Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

	At the SRM console prompt, enter
		show device
	to find the device ID of your CD-ROM drive (the device ID is
	usually in the second column (``bootdev'') and should start
	with DKA for a SCSI CD-ROM drive).  If your drive shows up with
	a drive number with trailing zeros, you will want to ignore them
	(unless it is DKA0).  For example, if your CD-ROM drive is listed
	as DKA600, you want to use dka6 (device ID's are case
	insensitive).

	On all MACHINE computers but the TURBOchannel DEC 3000 series,
	insert the OpenBSD/MACHINE CD and enter
		boot -fi OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd DEVICE
	where DEVICE is the dka device name.

	On the DEC 3000 series, insert the OpenBSD/MACHINE CD and enter
		boot -fi ALPHA DEVICE
	where DEVICE is the dka device name.
	
	Note that, in both cases, the argument order is important.

	You should see info about the primary and secondary boot
	and then the kernel should start to load.  If the kernel
	fails to load or the spinning cursor has stopped and nothing
	further has happened, you either have a hardware problem or
	your MACHINE is not currently supported by OpenBSD; try booting
	from a floppy instead if possible.


Installing using the Floppy or CD-ROM procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a non-serial console, the default of "vt220"
	is correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt220).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD repository of CTM 3155 (roughly today at noon).
Mostly in order to go 3.3-current and ease further merges of
both OpenBSD and ELFdiffs after the MirBSD has been enabled
to build again.

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way is
to boot from the bootable CD-ROM mini image, then install from your favorite
source. You can also use one of the OpenBSD installation floppies, if your

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

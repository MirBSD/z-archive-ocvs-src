@not-so-easy merge
note: the release process is currently marked as broken, because
the install.sub file needs some major fixes.
they are so major I'll eventually rewrite the stuff now. let's see.

Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	DOS (FAT) partitions
	EXT2 partitions
	Tape
dnl	Remote NFS partition
	FTP
	HTTP

If you can't (or don't want to) boot off a CD-ROM, you can use a floppy
disk (1.44MB required).  Failing that, if your computer supports PXE, you
can prepare a server to start the install across the network, but you will
still need the install sets available on one of the above media types.

Creating a PXE network bootable setup using OpenBSD or other Un*x-like system:

	In order to start the install via PXE, you will need to set up a
	DHCP server and a TFTP server.  The details of how to do this
	vary considerably, depending on the network's host.  You should
	refer to the relevant man pages or administrator's guide for the
	host system.

	The DHCP server should return "pxeboot" to amd64 clients as the
	network boot program.  Both pxeboot and the bsd.rd install kernel
	should be copied to the TFTP server's root directory.

	If you are using an OpenBSD server, you can use the supplied
	dhcpd and tftpd.  A sample configuration for dhcpd is given in
	the pxeboot(8) man page.  You can get it from the man{:--:}OSrev.tgz
	distribution set, or see the copy on the OpenBSD web page.  You
	should also refer to dhcpd(8) and tftpd(8) for more information
	on configuring them.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

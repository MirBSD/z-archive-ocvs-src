INSTALLATION NOTES for MirBSD/MACHINE OSREV

Hey hey, this is the ninth release of MirOS BSD, and the project
still has not written some decent installation instructions, let
alone the new installer.
Looks like we could need some help. Do _you_ want to help?


What is MirBSD?
---------------

MirOS BSD is now developed by The MirOS Project: http://mirbsd.de/

MirBSD used to be a variant (patch kit) of OpenBSD, for which the developer
hasn't had time yet to update the documentation. You can find quite
some references to OpenBSD in the documentation, but it is becoming
updated slowly. (You can volunteer to help...)

For more information on MirBSD, read the documentation, such as the
mail the 'root' user has gotten after the system powered up for the
first time; the /usr/share/man/COPYRIGHT file and the stuff located
in /usr/share/doc. You can also browse the MirBSD web site online:
>>> http://mirbsd.de/
On an installed system, just typing 'lynx' and hitting the 'RETURN'
key will point you to that site using a popular web browser.


What is OpenBSD?
----------------

OpenBSD is a fully functional, multi-platform UN*X-like Operating
System based on Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite.
There are several operating systems in this family, but OpenBSD
differentiates itself by putting security and correctness first.  The
OpenBSD team strives to achieve what is called a 'secure by default'
status.  This means that an OpenBSD user should feel safe that their
newly installed machine will not be compromised.  This 'secure by
default' goal is achieved by taking a proactive stance on security.

Since security flaws are essentially mistakes in design or implement-
ation, the OpenBSD team puts as much importance on finding and fixing
existing design flaws and implementation bugs as it does writing new
code.  This means that an OpenBSD system will not only be more secure,
but it will be more stable.  The source code for all critical system
components has been checked for remote-access, local-access, denial-
of-service, data destruction, and information-gathering problems.

In addition to bug fixing, OpenBSD has integrated strong cryptography
into the base system.  A fully functional IPsec implementation is
provided as well as support for common protocols such as SSL and SSH.
Network filtering and monitoring tools such as packet filtering, NAT, and
bridging are also standard.  For high performance demands, support for
hardware cryptography has also been added to the base system.  Because
security is often seen as a tradeoff with usability, OpenBSD provides
as many security options as possible to allow the user to enjoy secure
computing without feeling burdened by it.

To integrate more smoothly in other environments, OpenBSD also
provides several binary emulation subsystems (which includes
Linux, NetBSD and FreeBSD compatibility for the i386 architecture),
aiming at making the emulation as accurate as possible so that it is
transparent to the user.

Because OpenBSD is from Canada, the export of Cryptography pieces
(such as OpenSSH, IPsec, and Kerberos) to the world is not restricted.

(NOTE: MirOS can not be re-exported from the US once it has entered
the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distribution from
an FTP server in the US if you are outside of Canada and the US.)

Sources of MirBSD:
------------------

MirBSD OSREV Release Contents:
---------------------------

Please note that MirBSD OSREV does not use the gzipped POSIX ustar format
for storing the compressed content of the installation sets, but rather
the SVR4 CPIO format with (packages) or without (dist sets) CRC, gzipped.

The MirBSD OSREV release is organized in the following way.  In the
.../v{:--:}OSrev directory, for each of the architectures having an MirBSD OSREV
binary distribution, there is a sub-directory.

includeit(contents)


MirBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
-------------------------------------------------

includeit(hardware)


Getting the MirBSD System onto Useful Media:
--------------------------------------------

includeit(xfer)


Preparing your System for MirBSD Installation:

includeit(prep)


Installing the MirBSD System:
-----------------------------

includeit(install)


Upgrading a previously-installed MirBSD System:
-----------------------------------------------

includeit(upgrade)


Getting source code for your MirBSD System:
-------------------------------------------

Now that your MirBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

A few methods are provided.  If you have an MirBSD CD-ROM, the source code
is provided.  Otherwise, you can get the pieces over the Internet using
ANONCVS, CTM, or FTP.  For more information, see

	http://mirbsd.de/
	http://www.OpenBSD.org/anoncvs.html
	http://www.OpenBSD.org/ctm.html
	http://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html


Using online MirBSD documentation:
----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1),
	hostname.if(5),
	passwd(5) and
	afterboot(8).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.

There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@@OpenBSD.ORG>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.  There are also two OpenBSD Usenet newsgroups,
comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.announce for important announcements and
comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.misc for general OpenBSD discussion.

To report bugs, use the 'sendbug' command shipped with OpenBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports {:-include-:} lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	bugs@@OpenBSD.ORG

Use of 'sendbug' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the OpenBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.

For any patches, suggestions etc. please do look at the current

You must use MirPorts from MirOS #7bis with MirOS #7ter, but
MirOS #7-stable (including MirOS #7quater) requires you to
use MirPorts-current.
A sample ports34.tgz has been included, but to stay secure,

The upgrade set's size is about one third (1/3) of the size of
the base34.tgz package, however, it will take less space on your

whose new versions will be written to /snapshot/etc).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

The OSREV release features more user programs and device drivers,
extensive firewalling and network bandwidth management capabilities,
as well as numerous security mechanisms (stricter control over memory
execute and write permissions, compiler built-in stack protection,
privilege separation or early revocation of privileges in more and
more executables, etc).

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

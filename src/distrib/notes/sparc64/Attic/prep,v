If your UltraSPARC machine is somewhat old, it might need a firmware update
before it can be used under OpenBSD. You are advised to try to install
OpenBSD first; if it can't boot or fails mysteriously, you might need to
update your firmware. To do so, check the ``Updating your firmware''
section later in this document.

Your OpenBOOT ROM may need some setup.  You cannot use the security modes
of the OpenBOOT ROM.  Make sure that the ROM security modes are disabled:

    ok setenv security-mode none


Please note that while OpenBSD and Solaris have a reasonable degree of
compatibility between disk labels and filesystems there are some problems
to watch out for during initial installation or when trying to maintain
both OpenBSD and Solaris environments on the same system.

    If the OpenBSD fsck(8) utility is used on a Solaris filesystem, it will
    set OpenBSD "clean flags" and BSD4.4 summary fields in the superblock.
    Solaris does *not* like this and you will have to do a "fsck -b 32" under
    Solaris to access an alternate superblock to repair the filesystem.  You
    should always specify Solaris filesystem with a "pass number" of 0 in
    their /etc/fstab entry to prevent this, and preferably mount them "RO".

    If Solaris fsck is used on an OpenBSD filesystem in the default OpenBSD
    (4.4BSD) format, it will first complain about the superblock and then
    about missing . and .. entries.  Do *not* try to "correct" these
    problems, as attempting to do so will completely trash the filesystem.

    You should avoid using soft updates (option softdep in /etc/fstab)
    on your shared filesystems.  Although untested, it is likely that
    Solaris would be confused by a filesystem with soft update flags
    enabled.

The OpenBSD "Sun Compatible" disklabel have been extended to support 16
partitions, which may be compatible with Solaris, but the Solaris
format(1M) utility only sees the first 8 partitions and may "lose"
information about the extended partitions.

Use Solaris format(1M) only with *extreme* caution on drives that contain
OpenBSD partitions.


OpenBSD and Sun bootblocks are similar in concept, though implemented
differently.  The OpenBSD bootblocks are architecture independent and also
understand the extended disklabels with 16 partitions.  You can use Solaris
bootblocks, but remember that OpenBSD bootblocks must be installed with
OpenBSD installboot and Solaris bootblocks with Solaris installboot.

Most of the new Ultras shipped by Sun with a preinstalled Solaris have an
initial specific factory setup of the boot ROM, in order to start up
Solaris WebStart at the first boot; the boot-device variable is set to
disk:f.  Make sure you reset the boot device to its default value:

    ok set-default boot-device

will work for most systems. This can be adapted if you've multiple
systems installed and know what you're doing.


Updating your firmware:
-----------------------

If OpenBSD does not boot or install properly on your machine, it might need
a firmware update.

Updating your firmware is a dangerous operation which may damage your
hardware. Be sure to follow carefully these instructions, and if in doubt,
please don't do this.

You will need to have a working operating system installed on your machine,
in order to perform the update.  If this is not the case, you might be able
to boot the flash updater software via network, but this has not been tested
and is not supported by Sun.

The firmware update is delivered as a specific patch, depending on your
machine:

Get the patch installation notes from SunSolve, as
    ftp://sunsolve.sun.com/pub/patches/104169.readme
(replace 104169 with the correct patch number).
Check the Patch-ID# line in this readme file to get the patch filename, for
example 104169-08. The patch filename will then be either
    ftp://sunsolve.sun.com/pub/patches/104169-08.tar.Z
or
    ftp://sunsolve.sun.com/pub/patches/104169-08.zip

Follow the patch installation notes very carefully. You will need to open
your machine in order to apply this patch.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

Find your favorite disk partitioning utility.  Some
of the ones that have been tried and seem to work are:
	APS Powertools 2.7.3
	SCSI Directory Lite
	Disk Manager Mac from OnTrack
	HD SC Setup from Apple
	I/O Formatter from Diversified (?)
	Silverlining from LaCie

You can get "HD SC Setup" from
	ftp://ftphqx.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/
	    Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/Utilities/
	    Apple_HD_SC_Setup_7.3.5.sea.bin
(this address has been split into several lines for readability).
This utility ignores non-Apple hard disks unless you patch it with the
application found at <http://www.euronet.nl/users/ernstoud/hdpatch.html>.

** First, be sure you have a reliable backup of any data
** which you may want to keep.  All information on the hard
** drive you will be repartitioning will be lost.

That done, use your favorite partitioning utility to make
at least one A/UX "Root & Usr" partition and an A/UX "Swap"
partition.  The "Root & Usr" partition should be _at least_
250MB in size if you wish to install all the sets.  This partition
will be the root partition of your OpenBSD system.

Generally, you should allocate twice as much swap space as you have real
memory (so, if you have 16MB of RAM, specify 32MB of swap space).
Systems that will be heavily used or that are low on real
memory should have more swap space allocated.  Systems that
will be only lightly used can get away with less.

If you like, you can also create a smaller root partition
and a larger /usr.  If you plan to use this machine as a
server, you may also want a separate /var.  Create these
partitions as the BSD "usr" or "User slice X" type.

It is also possible to use the Mkfs utility to "convert" partitions from
MacOS partitions to BSD partitions.  Mkfs will be discussed in more detail
later, but it is also very possible to simply prepare your hard drive by
partitioning it with MacOS partitions of the correct size.  If you do this,
simply select the "Convert" button when choosing partitions to build a
filesystem on in Mkfs (see below).

Before moving on, you should assure that your machine is running the correct
software on the MacOS side.  In the Memory control panel, you should turn
Virtual Memory off whenever you are planning to use the BSD/Mac68k Booter.
You should also assure that your machine is using 32-bit addressing.  If
there is no "Addressing:" option in your Memory control panel and your
machine is supported, your probably will need Mode32.  Mode32 is a control
panel and extension combination which enable 32-bit addressing on older Macs
which do not use it by default.  This program is available from any Info-Mac
mirror.  Finally, we recommend strongly that, at least for the purposes of
setting the system up, you run with the machine's monitor in 1-bit ("Black
and White" in the monitor's control panel) mode.

All of that done and accounted for, you are now set to install OpenBSD on
your hard drive.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

@dnl	$OpenBSD: install,v 1.21 2002/10/30 21:37:40 miod Exp $
OpenBSDInstallPrelude

The installation can be broken down into four basic steps:
	* Running Mkfs to build a filesystem or filesystems.
	* Running Install Utility to load the files onto your filesystems.
	* Running the booter to boot the system.
	* Final system configuration.


Preparing the filesystems:

Double-click on the Mkfs application icon to start it up.  It will ask
you for the SCSI ID of the drive that you are installing upon.  Once
this is selected, it will present a list of the partitions on that disk.
Select the partition on which you wish to build a filesystem and click
on the "Format" button.  You will now be asked for a bunch of parameters
for the hard drive and the filesystem.  Usually, you can just take the
defaults.  Note that although this dialog only has the "OK" button, you are
not committed, yet.  Once you get the values you want, press the "OK"
button. A dialog will be presented at this point with two options: "Format"
and "Cancel." If you choose "Cancel," nothing will be written to your drive.
If you choose "Format," the program will proceed to make a filesystem.

Mkfs is not a well-behaved MacOS application.  It will not allow
any other tasks to run while it does (cooperative multitasking at its
best).  When it's finished, the program will put up a dialog to ask if
you have scanned the output for any error messages.  Usually there won't
have been any errors, but do scan the output to make sure.  Simply click
on the "I Read It" button and the program will quit.

Repeat as necessary for any extra partitions that you wish to make
filesystems on.  Note that you do _not_ need a filesystem on your swap
partition.


Installing the distribution sets:

Double-click on the Install Utility icon to start it up.  The installer
will present the same SCSI ID menu that mkfs did.  Select the same SCSI
ID that you did for mkfs--i.e., the one you are installing onto.

If you are installing onto a single root partition, proceed to the
"Installing the base files" section, below.

	If you have not created filesystems for the root, usr, and
	any other partitions, go back to "Preparing the filesystem(s),"
	above.

	When you started the installer, it mounted your root partition.
	Just before it printed, "Mounting partition 'A' as /," it printed
	lines like:
		sd1 at scsi ID 5.
	This means that the device for scsi ID 5 is sd1.  The partitions
	are signified by a trailing letter.  For instance, sd1a would be
	the root partition of the second scsi disk in the chain, and sd0g
	would be the first usr partition on the first scsi disk.  It is
	important to emphasize that device numbers after the 'sd' do not
	correspond to SCSI IDs of disks but rather to logical disks.  The
	lowest SCSI ID will always be sd0 proceeded by increasing ID
	numbers.

	You will need to know the proper device to mount the remaining
	partition(s) by hand:

		* Select "Build Devices" from the "File" menu.  This builds
		  the necessary tree of device files on your filesystem in
		  /dev.

		* Select "Mini Shell" from the "File" menu.

		* Mount the filesystems you wish with the command:
			mount device path
		  For example, if you wish to mount the second partition from
		  the first scsi disk, sd0, on /usr, you would type:
			mount /dev/sd0b /usr

		* Type "quit" to exit the minishell after you have mounted
		  all the filesystems.


Installation of base files:

	Select the "Install" menu item from the "File" menu and install
	base{:--:}OSrev.tgz, bsd.tgz, comp{:--:}OSrev.tgz, and any other
	packages you wish to install at this time (see the contents section
	for information about what's in each package).  The installer will
	print out the filename of each file as it is installed and will
	take quite some time to install everything.

	As is the case with Mkfs, this is not a particularly well-behaved
	MacOS application and the machine will be completely tied up
	while the installation takes place.

	At some point after installing the base package, select the "Build
	Devices" option from the "File" menu.  This will create a bunch of
	device nodes for you in /dev and your initial /etc/fstab.  The
	installer program also has an option to give you a mini-shell.


Booting the system:

Double-click on the BSD/Mac68k Booter icon to start the application.  Check
that the options in the Booting dialog look sane--especially the SCSI ID.
If not, correct them to your preference.  You will have to change the kernel
name to "/bsd".  When you are satisfied with your choices, try booting
OpenBSD.

If you wish to save your preferences, choose the "Save Preferences"
option in the "File" menu, then quit the application and restart.  Due
to a long-standing bug, the preferences will not be saved unless you
quit.  Note that by setting the BSD/Mac68k Booter to boot automatically
after starting, and by placing an alias to the booter in the "Startup Items"
folder, one can make the Mac68k autoload OpenBSD upon startup.

Note that on a Mac68k, the generation of the DSA and RSA keys can take quite
some time -- on a slower system, it may take an hour or more.
Be patient.


Final Configuration:

Unlike other OpenBSD platforms, OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does not configure the
network or set a root password as part of the installation process. The user
will have to do this after the first OpenBSD boot.  Upon first boot, root
will have no password, just hit RETURN when prompted. You will want to set
the root password using the passwd(1) command.

To set up basic networking, you will need to create or edit the following
files, all of which are in the /etc directory:
	myname		the computers name (without domain).
	mygate		the IP address of the default gateway.
	hostname.if	Configuration of the host adapter (actual name will
			be something like hostname.sn0 or hostname.ae0, see
			your dmesg for your adapter name).
	resolv.conf	Name server configuration.
	hosts		names and IP addresses of this machine and others on
			the network.
	dhclient.conf	dhcp client information.

Once these files are configured, your system will be very much like any
other OpenBSD system.  'mygate' and 'myname' are just single-line  text
files, for info on the others, see hostname.if(5), resolv.conf(5), hosts(5)
and dhclient.conf(5) in the OpenBSD man pages.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@remove the openbsd-style installation documentation
Benny will provide some new, better, later.
@
text
@PLEASE READ THIS PARAGRAPH if you have installed MirBSD or OpenBSD
before. Some of the documentation which used to come with the
installation system has been removed because it's said to be out
of date. The current versions are likely to be found at
	http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiw.htm
(ATA/ATAPI: How It Works).

NOTE: If you wish to install MirBSD on your whole disk, i.e. you do
not want DOS or any other operating system to reside on your hard
disk, you can skip this section and go on to the section that
describes installation, below.  If you're upgrading your system from a
previous release of MirBSD, you should have proceeded directly to the
section about upgrading; you need none of the information presented
here.

First and foremost, before beginning the installation process, MAKE
SURE YOU HAVE A RELIABLE BACKUP of any data on your hard disk that you
wish to keep.  Repartitioning your hard disk is an excellent way to
destroy important data.

Second, if you are using a disk controller which supports disk geometry
translation, be sure to use the same parameters for MirBSD as for DOS
or the other operating systems installed on your disk, in fdisk. Also,
use the same parameters as the BIOS uses for installboot.  If you do not,
it will be much harder to make MirBSD properly coexist with them.
Utilities exist which will print out the disk geometry which DOS sees;
some versions of DOS "fdisk" also do this.  If you have an "EIDE" hard
disk, DOS and MirBSD probably won't see the same geometry, and you must
be careful to find out the DOS geometry and tell MirBSD about it during
the installation. Be sure you aren't using geometry translation that you
don't know about, but that the DOS "fdisk" program does!

The MirBSD partitions need not be within the first 1024 cylinders any more,
unless your BIOS does not support the LBA access function (AH=42h).
If your BIOS does not support multiple-sector reads (this is true for example
for Soekris boxen), use the "machine oldbios" command in /boot.

Fourth, use the other operating system's "fdisk" program or partition
editor to create at least one of the partitions to be used for that
operating system.  If that operating system is already set up to use the
entire disk, you will have to back it up, remove and recreate a smaller
partition for it, and then restore the data from that partition.  You do
not have to create an MirBSD partition at this time, the MirBSD install-
ation will give you an opportunity to create the partition needed for
MirBSD.

Finally, do whatever is necessary to restore order to the partition
you took space away from.  If it was a DOS partition, you probably
will need to use "format" to create a new file system on it, and then
restore your important files from your backups.  Other operating
systems will have different needs; most will need to reformat the
partition, and if it was their "main" partition, will probably need
to be reinstalled.

Once you've backed all your data up, there is a tool called fips 2.0
that can shrink your FAT-based DOS/Windows partition to make room for
MirBSD.  It is included in the MACHINE tools area of this distribution as
a convenience.  It is strongly advised that you read its documentation
and understand the consequences of your actions before using it.  In some
cases, defragmenting your disk and running fips may be much faster than
reinstalling your DOS partition from the backup.

Your hard disk is now prepared to have MirBSD installed on it, and
you should proceed with the installation instructions.

@the first part of making a release (non-X)
* sync sets (for now)
* mention set sizes in INSTALL.i386
* install all files, but not more than wanted
* fix build time warnings
  (the mktemp in lpd is said to be safe)
* update docs a bit
* the eqn -> neqn move
* improved man page generation
* anoncvsbin removes tmp before making new symlink
* sendmail generated files are now in sendmail, and
  SKIPDIRS is checked before (asked for by Waldemar Brodkorb)

the installation.

Third (but related to the second point above), if you are using a hard
disk with more sectors than DOS or your controller's BIOS supports without
some kind of software translation utility or other kludge, you MUST
BE SURE that all partitions which you want to boot from must start and end
below cylinder 1024 by the BIOS's idea of the disk, and that all DOS
partitions MUST EXIST ENTIRELY BELOW cylinder 1024, unless you are using
the MirBSD /usr/mdec/mbr bootmanager or /usr/mdec/mbr_simple bootloader to
chain to the PBR of specified operating systems which know about how to use
the LBA access mode to BIOS hard discs.  Be sure you aren't using geometry
translation that you don't know about, but that the DOS "fdisk" program
does!

The OpenBSD root partition must also reside completely within the BIOS
supported part of the hard disk -- this would typically be 504M, 2G or 8G,
depending upon the age of the machine and its BIOS.  Due to a limit of the
OpenBSD boot loader, the root partition must be within the first 8G even if
the BIOS supports more.  Note that only the root partition has this issue,
once OpenBSD is loaded, the entire disk is available for use.

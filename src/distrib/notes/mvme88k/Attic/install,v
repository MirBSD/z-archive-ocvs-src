@dnl	$OpenBSD: install,v 1.8 2003/01/04 00:18:08 miod Exp $
Installing OpenBSD is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand it shouldn't be too much trouble.

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that can
be booted from tape. Alternatively, if your mvme88k is hooked up in a
network you can find a server and arrange for a diskless setup which is a
convenient way to install on a machine whose disk does not currently hold
a usable operating system (see the section `Installing using a diskless
setup' below).


Installing using the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel.

The ramdisk kernel is a kernel that containes an OpenBSD filesystem holding
all utilities necessary to install OpenBSD on a local disk. It is distributed
as a binary file with the name bsd.rd.

After the initial probe messages you'll asked to start the install
or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section `Running the installation
scripts' below.


Installing using a diskless setup.

First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at the
diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it (on SunOS systems, add_client(8) is a
good start).

Second, you must configure the netboot parameters in the mvme88k Bug
using the NIOT command.  The Load Address should be 0xAF0000.  The
Execution Address should be 0xAF0008.

Your mvme88k expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address followed by the machine's architecture, separated
by a period. For example, a sun4c machine which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for a file that has
been named in the nvram.  Normally, this file is a second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).
You can find the boot program in `/usr/mdec/netboot' in the OpenBSD/mvme88k
distribution.

After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the PROM, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.


As noted above in the section `Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation',
you have several options when choosing a location to store the installation
filesets. However, the easiest way is to put the *.tgz files you want
to install into the root directory for your client on the server.

Next, unpack `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' on the server in the root
directory for your machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and the
install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/sun4.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

Now you must populate the `/dev' directory for your client. If the server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to `<root>/dev'
and run the MAKEDEV script: `sh MAKEDEV all' (this might require the edition
of MAKEDEV to change the PATH for it to work properly).

On SunOS 5.x systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be error
messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are inconsequential
for the purpose of installing OpenBSD. However, you may want to correct them
if you plan to the diskless setup regularly. In that case, you may re-run
MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD machine once it has booted.

Boot your workstation from the server by entering the appropriate `boot'
command at the monitor prompt. Depending on the PROM version in your machine,
this command takes one of the following forms:

	187-bug> nbo 00 00 bsd -s

This will boot the OpenBSD kernel in single-user mode.

If you use a diskless setup with a separately NFS-mounted /usr filesystem,
mount /usr by hand now:

OpenBSD# mount /usr

At this point, it's worth checking the disk label and partition sizes on
the disk you want to install OpenBSD onto. OpenBSD understands SunOS-style
disklabels, so if your disk was previously used by SunOS there will be
a usable label on it. Use `disklabel -e <disk>' (where <disk> is the
device name assigned by the OpenBSD kernel, e.g. `sd0') to view and
modify the partition sizes. See the section `Preparing your System for
OpenBSD Installation' above for suggestions about disk partition sizes.
Make sure all your partitions start and end on cylinder boundaries.

NOTE: if you are installing on a SCSI disk that does *not* have a SunOS
or OpenBSD label on it, you may still be able to use disklabel(8) but you'll
have to create all partitions from scratch. If your disk is listed in
`/etc/disktab', you may use the entry (which in most cases only defines
a `c' partition to describe the whole disk) to put an initial label on
the disk.  DO NOT USE `disklabel -r ...' TO INITIALIZE YOUR DISK LABEL;
THIS WILL LEAD TO UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS. This deficiency will be fixed
in a next release.

Here follows an example of what you'll see while in the disklabel editor.
Do not touch any of the parameters except for the `label: ' entry and
the actual partition size information at the bottom (the lines starting
with `a:', `b:', ...).

The size and offset fields are given in sector units. Be sure to make
these numbers multiples of the of the number of sectors per cylinder:
the kernel might be picky about these things, but aside from this you'll
have the least chance of wasting disk space.
Partitions on which you intend to have a mountable filesystem, should
be given fstype `4.2BSD'. Remember, the `c' partition should describe
the whole disk.
The `(Cyl. x - y)' info that appears after the hash (`#') character is
treated as a comment and need not be filled in when altering partitions.

Special note: the line containing `8 partitions:' is best left alone,
even if you {:-define-:} less then eight partitions. If this line displays
a different number and the program complains about it (after you leave
the editor), then try setting it to `8 partitions:'.

<END SAMPLE DISKLABEL SCREEN>


If you are upgrading a OpenBSD installation, start the upgrade script:

OpenBSD# sh upgrade.sh

else, start the installation script:

OpenBSD# sh install.sh


These scripts will do most of the work of transferring the system from the
tar files onto your disk. You will frequently be asked for confirmation
before the script proceeds with each phase of the installation process.
Occasionally, you'll have to provide a piece of information such as the
name of the disk you want to install on or IP addresses and domain names
you want to assign. If your system has more than one disk, you may want
to look at the output of the dmesg(8) command to see how your disks
have been identified by the kernel.

The installation script goes through the following phases:

	- determination of the disk to install OpenBSD on
	- checking of the partition information on the disk
	- creating and mounting the OpenBSD filesystems
	- setup of IP configuration
	- extraction of the distribution tar files
	- installation of boot programs


Now try a reboot.  (If needed, swap your scsi id's first).  Initially
I'd suggest you "bo bsd -bs", then try multiuser after that.
if you boot single-user the OpenBSD incantation to make the root
filesystem writable is

    OpenBSD# mount -u /dev/sd0a /

Congratulations, you have successfully installed OpenBSD OSREV.  When you
reboot into OpenBSD, you should log in as "root" at the login prompt.
You should create yourself an account and protect it and the "root" account
with good passwords.

Some of the files in the OpenBSD OSREV distribution might need to be
tailored for your site.  In particular, the /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file
will almost definitely need to be adjusted, and other files in /etc will
probably need to be modified.  If you are unfamiliar with UN*X-like
system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book that
discusses it.

OpenBSDInstallPrelude

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way in
terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that can be
booted from tape.

Alternatively, if your MACHINE is hooked up in a network, it is possible to
setup another machine as a server for diskless setup, which is a convenient
way to install on a machine whose disk does not currently hold a usable
operating system.
This is difficult to get set up correctly the first time, but easy to use
afterwards (see the section `Installing using a diskless setup' below).


Booting from the Installation Media:

Prior to attempting an installation, everything of value on the target
system should be backed up.  While installing OpenBSD does not necessarily
wipe out all the partitions on the hard disk, errors during the install
process can have unforeseen consequences and will probably leave the system
unbootable if the installation process is not completed. Availability of the
installation media for the prior installation, such as a Motorola
SystemV/MACHINE tape is always a good insurance, should it be necessary to
"go back" for some reason.

After taking care of all that, the system should be brought down gracefully
using the shutdown(8) and/or halt(8) commands, which will eventually go bakc
to the ``BUG>'' prompt (it may be necessary to send a break if the system is
completely halted).


Booting from SCSI tape:

dnl XXX 188 does not have built-in devices - will need quite a whack once
dnl 188 support is back.
Bootable tapes can be booted with the following command at the prompt:

	187-Bug> bo xx yy

Where `xx' is the SCSI controller number (00 for the built-in SCSI
controller), and `yy' is ten times the tape drive ID.

For example, booting from a tape drive using SCSI id 4 on the built-in
controller:
	187-Bug> bo 00 40


Installing using a diskless setup:

First, a diskless client configuration should be setup on a server. If the
boot server is an OpenBSD system, the diskless(8) manual page will provide
detailed information on the process.

If the server runs another operating system, the setup instructions will
likely be available as part of the documentation that came with it (on SunOS
systems, add_client(8) and the Sun System/Networks administrators guide
constitute a good start; on Solaris systems, share(1M) is a good starting
point as well).

Second, the MACHINE workstation should then be setup using the NIOT command
at the BUG prompt. The ``Load Address'' value should be 0xAF0000, and the
``Execution Address'' value should be 0xAF0000 as well.

Then, it should be possible to boot the machine from the server by entering
the NBO command at the BUG prompt:
	
	187-Bug> nbo 00 00 bsd.rd



Installing using the tape or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a slow
	network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If some action
	doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has stopped and
	nothing further has happened, either your boot media is bad, your
	diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have a hardware or
	configuration problem.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  You should choose
	the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).

Net Boot or Diskless Setup Information:

The set up is similar to SunOS diskless setup, but not identical, because
the Sun setup assumes that the bootblocks load a kernel image, which then
uses NFS to access the exported root partition, while the OpenBSD bootblocks
use internal NFS routines to load the kernel image directly from the
exported root partition.

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since there is
a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and configured
correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8) manpage, find
someone who's been through it before and use the host syslog and tcpdump(8)
to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your MACHINE expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap program
via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when instructed
to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of the
machine's IP address, followed by the machine's architecture, separated by a
period. For example, a MACHINE board which has been assigned IP address
130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for `8273900B.MACHINE'. Normally,
this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage boot program,
which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon can find it
(remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).

Recent BUG can list the available disk and tape controllers, using the

       6  VME328      $FFFF9000      *

In this example, the built-in controller, as well as an external MVME328
controller, are available.

The encoding for the drive ID is as follows:
- built-in controller and MVME327 SCSI controller:
    'yy' is ten times the device ID.
- MVME328 SCSI controller:
    'yy' is eight times the devic ID, written in hexadecimal
- MVME350 tape controller:
    'yy' is always zero, as this controller only supports one tape drive.

For example, booting from a tape drive using SCSI ID #5 will be done with:
    187-Bug> BO 00 50
using the built-in controller, but with:
    187-Bug> BO 06 28

The "NIOT;H" lists only the available controllers in the machine. For
example, if no external network card is present, only the built-in
controller will be reported:

    187-Bug> NIOT;A
    Network Controllers/Nodes Available
    CLUN  DLUN  Name      Address
       0     0  VME187    $FFF46000

If the BUG does not support the NIOT command (most MVME187 don't), then
it has no support for netbooting.

Before netbooting, enter "NIOT" and fill the parametrs. Be sure to provide
the correct values for Controller LUN and Device LUN (as listed in the
"NIOT;A" output); also the "Boot File Load Address" and "Boot File
Execution Address" need to be set to 00AF0000. The "Boot File Name" must
match the name of the netboot file on the server (copying it as
"netboot.mvme88k" is usually a wise choice). Finally, "Argument File Name"
needs to be set to "bsd.rd" in order to boot the installation miniroot,
rather than the regular kernel.

Here are acceptable values for a 187 card using the built-in controller:

    187-Bug> NIOT
    Controller LUN =00? 
    Device LUN     =00? 
    Node Control Memory Address =01FF0000? 
    Client IP Address      =0.0.0.0? 
    Server IP Address      =0.0.0.0? 
    Subnet IP Address Mask =255.255.255.0? 
    Broadcast IP Address   =255.255.255.255? 
    Gateway IP Address     =0.0.0.0? 
    Boot File Name ("NULL" for None)     =? netboot.mvme88k
    Argument File Name ("NULL" for None) =? bsd.rd
    Boot File Load Address         =001F0000? 00AF0000
    Boot File Execution Address    =001F0000? 00AF0000
    Boot File Execution Delay      =00000000? 
    Boot File Length               =00000000? 
    Boot File Byte Offset          =00000000? 
    BOOTP/RARP Request Retry       =00? 
    TFTP/ARP Request Retry         =00? 
    Trace Character Buffer Address =00000000? 
    BOOTP/RARP Request Control: Always/When-Needed (A/W)=W? 
    BOOTP/RARP Reply Update Control: Yes/No (Y/N)       =Y? 

If you change the NIOT configuration, you will be asked whether you want to
make these changes permanent. Do not answer Y unless you plan to netboot
this board very often; be sure to have the ENV settings use a correct
address for the NIOT parameters block in this case. A valid setting is:

    Network Auto Boot Configuration Parameters Pointer (NVRAM) =
        00000000? FFFC0080

for example.

Once the NIOT parameters are set, it should be possible to boot the machine
from the server with the NBO command. However, in some cases, netbooting
will prevent the OpenBSD kernel from probing the built-in SCSI controller
(if any) properly, so it is recommended to do a disk probe first:

    187-Bug> IOI;C
    187-Bug> IOI

This can take up to a couple of minutes, depending how many SCSI controllers
are found in the machine. Once the BUG prompt is back, you can safely
netboot:
d68 1
a68 13
    187-Bug> NBO 00 00

or if you know the IP address for the MACHINE and the diskless server,
you can directly provide the boot loader's filename and the kernel name
on the commandline:

     187-Bug> NBO 00 00 192.168.0.68 192.168.0.1 netboot.mvme88k bsd.rd

where, in this example, 192.168.0.68 is the address of the MACHINE computer,
and 192.168.0.1 the address of the diskless server.

If the BUG version does not understand the NIOT and NBO commands (most
MVME187 don't), there is currently no way to netboot.
d127 16

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since
there is a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and
configured correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8)
manpage, find someone who's been through it before and use the host
syslog and tcpdump(8) to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your MACHINE expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for the filename specified
on the NBO commandline, or via the NIOT parameters.

Normally, this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).
d146 8
a153 8
After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the BUG, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.

Boot device restrictions:

The BUG firmware will not necessarily be able to boot from any device in
the system.

The following limitations apply:
- bootable SCSI tapes must have device ID 4 or 5.
- bootable SCSI disks must have device ID 0, 1, 2 or 3.
- only the first two MVME328 cards in a system (CLUN 6 and 7) can be
  used as the boot controller.

OpenBSD/MACHINE can boot off any network card supported by the BUG, even
if the card itself is not supported by OpenBSD. Two network boot loaders
are provided: one for Sun-compatible diskless setup (bootparams and NFS
root), and a simpler version limited to TFTP support.

The Sun-compatible network bootloader currently only supports the MVME187
on-board interface, and will not be able to boot from any other Ethernet
controller. The tftp bootloader does not have this limitation and will boot
from any BUG-supported Ethernet controller.

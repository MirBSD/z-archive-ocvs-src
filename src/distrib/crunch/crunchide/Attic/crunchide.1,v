.Sh NAME
.Nm crunchide
.Nd hides symbol names from ld, for crunching programs together
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm crunchide
.Op Fl f Ar keep-list-file
.Op Fl k Ar keep-symbol
.Op Ar object-file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Nm Crunchide
hides the global symbols of
.Ar object-file
such that they are ignored by subsequent runs of the linker,
.Xr ld 1 .
Some symbols may be left visible via the
.Fl k Ar keep-symbol
and
.Fl f Ar keep-list-file
options.  The
.Ar keep-list-file
must contain a list of symbols to keep visible, one symbol per line.
Note that the C compiler prepends an underscore in front of
symbols, so to keep the C function ``foo'' visible, the option
\&``-k _foo'' must be used.

.Pp
.Nm Crunchide
is designed as a companion program for
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
which automates the process of creating crunched binaries from
multiple component programs.
.Sh NOTES
The ELF version of
.Nm crunchide
mangles the symboltable beyond recognition.
It is therefore not advisable to try to run
.Xr nm 1
on a crunched object file. This is due to the nature of the ELF symboltable
and how some arches uses the symbol attributes for their GOT build.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
.Xr ld 1

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

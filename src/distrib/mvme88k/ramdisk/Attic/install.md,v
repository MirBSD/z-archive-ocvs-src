Here is an example of what the partition information will look like once
you have entered the disklabel editor. Disk partition sizes and offsets
are in sector (most likely 512 bytes) units. Make sure these size/offset
pairs are on cylinder boundaries (the number of sector per cylinder is
given in the 'sectors/cylinder' entry, which is not shown here).

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.
It's probably also wisest not to touch the '16 partitions:' line, even
in case you have defined less than sixteen partitions.

[Example]
16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:    50176        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0 - 111)
  b:    64512    50176      swap                        # (Cyl.  112 - 255)
  c:   640192        0   unknown                        # (Cyl.    0 - 1428)
  d:   525504   114688    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  256 - 1428)
[End of example]

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

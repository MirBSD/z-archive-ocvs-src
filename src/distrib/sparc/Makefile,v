@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

yes, this does mean this qnza thing sort of builds through,

@Build both Ramdisk and Miniroot.

-
Turns out that the "vnd" problem was a problem with hardware;
it happened with a SuperSPARC 50 MHz CPU, but not with the
SuperSPARC II 75 MHz CPU I have now (though I needed a mainboard
upgrade, the old openfirmware seems to not like the new CPU and
suspects it's a Viking module (wtf?)...)

XXX ramdisk and miniroot need fixup. elf2aout I'm working on
XXX right now, but the ramdisk does't do NFS which should be
XXX done in any case, and things added for i386 (netcat, find
XXX come to mind) _could_ be possibly added to sparc as well.

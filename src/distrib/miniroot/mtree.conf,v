@calendar: typo (from obsd)
the rest:
 - tell sshd on bsd.rd to not use login.conf or bsd auth
 - tell passwd on bsd.rd to use old-style V6 UNIX(R) DES
   crypt(3) hashes (yes this _is_ insecure)
 - don't put libexec/auth on bsd.rd any more
 => this makes sshd work again

@not-so-easy merge
note: the release process is currently marked as broken, because
the install.sub file needs some major fixes.
they are so major I'll eventually rewrite the stuff now. let's see.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

@Build both Ramdisk and Miniroot.

-
Turns out that the "vnd" problem was a problem with hardware;
it happened with a SuperSPARC 50 MHz CPU, but not with the
SuperSPARC II 75 MHz CPU I have now (though I needed a mainboard
upgrade, the old openfirmware seems to not like the new CPU and
suspects it's a Viking module (wtf?)...)

XXX ramdisk and miniroot need fixup. elf2aout I'm working on
XXX right now, but the ramdisk does't do NFS which should be
XXX done in any case, and things added for i386 (netcat, find
XXX come to mind) _could_ be possibly added to sparc as well.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

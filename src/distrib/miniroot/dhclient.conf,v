@Build both Ramdisk and Miniroot.

-
Turns out that the "vnd" problem was a problem with hardware;
it happened with a SuperSPARC 50 MHz CPU, but not with the
SuperSPARC II 75 MHz CPU I have now (though I needed a mainboard
upgrade, the old openfirmware seems to not like the new CPU and
suspects it's a Viking module (wtf?)...)

XXX ramdisk and miniroot need fixup. elf2aout I'm working on
XXX right now, but the ramdisk does't do NFS which should be
XXX done in any case, and things added for i386 (netcat, find
XXX come to mind) _could_ be possibly added to sparc as well.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

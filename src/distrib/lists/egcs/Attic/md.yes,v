@libgcc.so obviously belongs into the base set (for the snapshot I'm
just uploading, it's in a noegcs7.tgz set), but how to do this?

for now, it's MD i386, but what with i386-nogcc3 builds? (I could say
they aren't supported, but... - well, we'll go this way until someone
comes up with a good idea)

That's pretty much all of it. Now, there'll be testing, and
after that, watch http://symlink.lu/ or http:///..org/  ;-)

@the first part of making a release (non-X)
* sync sets (for now)
* mention set sizes in INSTALL.i386
* install all files, but not more than wanted
* fix build time warnings
  (the mktemp in lpd is said to be safe)
* update docs a bit
* the eqn -> neqn move
* improved man page generation
* anoncvsbin removes tmp before making new symlink
* sendmail generated files are now in sendmail, and
  SKIPDIRS is checked before (asked for by Waldemar Brodkorb)
* more SKIPDIR checks, mostly for GNU stuff

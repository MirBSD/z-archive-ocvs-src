@* move distrib/lists/<set> to distrib/lists/base/<set>
  so the new structure is distrib/lists/<list>/<set>/mi
  where <list> is the same as in /usr/obj/D/<list>
  and distrib/lists/<list>/ignfiles exist
* add new set htman8.ngz containing the online manpages
* copy old contrib/samples/man2htm.sh, slightly adapted
  for the release process, here
* generate that set during make b-r

remove some sparc and xc-old/xc-mit remnants

XXX comp is second-largest now (after xfont), need ideas, come to IRC

agreed: <benz|lernen> joa, warum nicht

.Sh NAME
.Nm edquota
.Nd edit user quotas
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm edquota
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl p Ar proto-username
.Ar username | uid Op Ar ...
.Nm edquota
.Fl g
.Op Fl p Ar proto-groupname
.Ar groupname | gid Op Ar ...
.Nm edquota

.Fl g
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm edquota
is a quota editor.
By default, or if the
.Fl u
flag is specified,
one or more users may be specified on the command line.
If a numeric ID is given instead of a name, that UID/GID
will be used even if there is not a corresponding ID in
the
.Pa /etc/passwd
or
.Pa /etc/group
files.
For each user a temporary file is created
with an
.Tn ASCII
representation of the current
disk quotas for that user.
The list of filesystems with user quotas is determined from
.Pa /etc/fstab .
An editor is invoked on the
.Tn ASCII
file.
The editor invoked is
.Xr vi 1
unless the environment variable
.Ev EDITOR
specifies otherwise.
.Pp
The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.
Setting a quota to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.
Setting a hard limit to one indicates that no allocations should
be permitted.
Setting a soft limit to one with a hard limit of zero
indicates that allocations should be permitted on
only a temporary basis (see
.Fl t
below).
The current usage information in the file is for informational purposes;
only the hard and soft limits can be changed.
.Pp
On leaving the editor,
.Nm edquota
reads the temporary file and modifies the binary
quota files to reflect the changes made.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
flag is specified,
.Nm edquota
will duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user
specified for each user specified.
This is the normal mechanism used to
initialize quotas for groups of users.
.Pp
If the
.Fl g
flag is specified,
.Nm edquota
is invoked to edit the quotas of
one or more groups specified on the command line.
The
.Fl p
flag can be specified in conjunction with
the
.Fl g
flag to specify a prototypical group
to be duplicated among the listed set of groups.
.Pp
Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits
for a grace period that may be specified per filesystem.
Once the grace period has expired,
the soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.
The default grace period for a filesystem is specified in
.Pa /usr/include/ufs/ufs/quota.h .
The
.Fl t
flag can be used to change the grace period.
By default, or when invoked with the
.Fl u
flag, the grace period is set for all the filesystems with user
quotas specified in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
When invoked with the
.Fl g
flag the grace period is
set for all the filesystems with group quotas specified in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
The grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default
grace period should be imposed.
Setting a grace period to one second indicates that no
grace period should be granted.
.Pp
Only the superuser may edit quotas.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm quotaon
announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one or more
filesystems.
.Nm quotaoff
announces to the system that the specified
filesystems should have any disk quotas
turned off.
The filesystems specified must have entries in
.Pa /etc/fstab
and be mounted.
.Nm quotaon
expects each filesystem to have quota files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated file system.
These defaults may be overridden in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
By default both user and group quotas are enabled.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the
.Fl a
flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
.Nm quotaon Ns / Ns Nm quotaoff
will enable/disable all the filesystems indicated in
.Pa /etc/fstab
to be read-write with disk quotas.
By default only the types of quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are enabled.
.It Fl g
Only group quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
should be enabled/disabled.
.It Fl u
Only user quotas listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
should be enabled/disabled.
.It Fl v
Causes
.Nm quotaon
and
.Nm quotaoff
to print a message for each filesystem where quotas are turned on or off.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
is equivalent to the default.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width quota.group -compact
.It Pa quota.user

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

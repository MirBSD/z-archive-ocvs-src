log
@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

.Sh NAME
.Nm mopd
.Nd MOP loader daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mopd
.Op Fl adf
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
services MOP Load requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface
or all interfaces if
.Fl a
is given.
In a load request received by
.Nm
a filename can be given.
This is the normal case for, e.g., terminal servers.
If a filename isn't given
.Nm
must know what image to load.
.Pp
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
checks if the requested file exists in
.Pa /tftpboot/mop .
The filename is normally all uppercase and with an extension of
.Pa .SYS .
If the filename isn't given, the Ethernet address of the target is used as
filename (e.g.,
.Pa 08002b09f4de.SYS ) ,
and it might be a soft link to another file.
.Pp
.Nm
supports two kinds of files.
The file is first checked to see if it is in
.Xr a.out 5
format.
If not, a few of Digital's formats are checked.
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.
Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Fl a
is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stdout.
The process will run in the foreground.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.El
.Sh BUGS
.Xr a.out 5
isn't supported yet on non-BSD implementations (otherOS).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:

# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

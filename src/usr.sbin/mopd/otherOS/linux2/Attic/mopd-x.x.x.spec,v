@# $OpenBSD: mopd-x.x.x.spec,v 1.1 1999/03/27 14:31:23 maja Exp $
Summary: MOP (Maintenance Operations Protocol) loader daemon
Name: mopd
Version: 2.5.4
Release: 2
Copyright: BSD
Group: Networking
Source: ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/NetBSD/mopd/mopd-2.5.4.tar.gz
BuildRoot: /var/tmp/mopd-2.5.4
Packager: Mats O Jansson <moj@@stacken.kth.se>

%description
Mopd services MOP Load requests on the Ethernet connected to interface or
all interfaces if a `-a' is given.  In a load request received by mopd a
filename can be given. This is the normal case for e.g. terminal servers.
If a filename isn't given mopd must know what image to load.

Upon receiving a request, mopd checks if the requested file exists in
/tftpboot/mop, the filename is normaly uppercase and with an extension of
.SYS. If the filename isn't given, the ethernet address of the target is
used as filename, e.g.  08002b09f4de.SYS and it might be a soft link to
another file.

Mopd supports two kinds of files. The first type that is check is if the
file is in a.out(5) format. If not, a couple of Digital's formats are
checked.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

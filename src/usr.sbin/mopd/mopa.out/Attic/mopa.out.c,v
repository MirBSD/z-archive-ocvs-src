@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

/* mopa.out - Convert a Unix format kernel into something that
 * can be transferred via MOP.
 *
 * This code was written while referring to the NetBSD/vax boot
 * loader. Therefore anything that can be booted by the Vax
 * should be convertable with this program.
 *
 * If necessary, the a.out header is stripped, and the program
 * segments are padded out. The BSS segment is zero filled.
 * A header is prepended that looks like an IHD header. In 
 * particular the Unix mahine ID is placed where mopd expects
 * the image type to be (offset is IHD_W_ALIAS). If the machine
 * ID could be mistaken for a DEC image type, then the conversion 
 * is aborted. The original a.out header is copied into the front
 * of the header so that once we have detected the Unix machine
 * ID we can haul the load address and the xfer address out.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import OpenBSD source with the "new" command line as well,
in order to be able to provide a MirBSD release which bases
upon a fairly current OpenBSD base source code tree deemed

.Sh NAME
.Nm rarpd
.Nd reverse ARP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rarpd
.Op Fl adfl
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface .
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which
must be present in both the
.Xr ethers 5
and
.Xr hosts 5
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.
.\" .Pp
.\" Additionally, a request is honored only if the server
.\" (i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
.\" can "boot" the target; that is, if the directory
.\" .Pa /tftpboot/ Ns Em ipaddr
.\" exists, where
.\" .Rm ipaddr
.\" is the target IP address.
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in the background.
Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Fl a
is omitted, an
.Ar interface
must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stderr.
This option implies the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.It Fl l
Log all requests to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/rarpd.pid -compact

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

Only honour a requests if if the server
(i.e., the host that rarpd is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, if a file or directory called
.Pa /tftpboot/ Ns Em ipaddr
exists, where
.Pa ipaddr
is the target IP address expressed in uppercase hexidecimal
(only the first 8 characters of filenames are checked).

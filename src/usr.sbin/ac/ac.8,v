.Sh NAME
.Nm ac
.Nd connect time accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ac
.Op Fl dp
.\".Op Fl c Ar console
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl w Ar wtmp
.Op Ar users ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
exists, a record of individual login and logout
times are written to it by
.Xr login 1
and
.Xr init 8 ,
respectively.
.Nm
examines these records and writes the accumulated connect time
for all logins to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.
.\" .It Fl c Ar console
.\" Use
.\" .Ar console
.\" as the name of the device that local X sessions (ut_host of ":0.0")
.\" originate from.  If any login has been recorded on
.\" .Ar console
.\" then these X sessions are ignored unless COMPAT_SUNOS was defined at
.\" compile time.
.It Fl p
Print individual users' totals.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Only do accounting logins on certain ttys.
The
.Ar tty
specification can start with
.Ql \&!
to indicate not this
.Ar tty
and end with
.Ql *
to indicate all similarly named ttys.
Multiple
.Fl t
flags may be specified.
.It Fl w Ar wtmp
Read connect time data from
.Ar wtmp
instead of the default file,
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.It Ar users ...
Display totals for the given individuals only.
.El
.Pp
If no arguments are given,
.Nm
displays the total connect time for all
accounts with login sessions recorded in
.Pa wtmp .
.Pp
The default
.Pa wtmp
file will increase without bound unless it is truncated.
It is normally truncated by the daily scripts run
by
.Xr cron 8 ,
which rename and rotate the
.Pa wtmp
files, keeping a week's worth of data on
hand.
No login or connect time accounting is performed if
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
does not exist.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset
$ ac -p -t "ttyd*" > modems
$ ac -p -t "!ttyd*" > other
.Ed
.Pp
allows times recorded in
.Pa modems
to be charged out at a different rate than
.Pa other .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if a fatal error occurred.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp.[0-7] -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
connect time accounting file
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp.[0-7]
rotated files
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr utmp 5 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr sa 8
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v6 .
This version of
.Nm
was written for
.Nx 0.9a
from the specification provided by various systems' manual pages.
.\" .Sh NOTES
.\" If COMPAT_SUNOS is defined
.\" .Nm ac
.\" ignores the fact that entries with ut_host of ":0.0" are not real
.\" login sessions.  Normally such entries are ignored except in the case
.\" of a user being logged in when the
.\" .Pa wtmp
.\" file was rotated, in which case a login with ut_host of ":0.0" may
.\" appear without any preceding console logins.
.\" If no one is logged in on the console, the user is deemed to have
.\" logged in on at the earliest time stamp found in
.\" .Pa wtmp .
.\" Use of
.\" .Pa console
.\" allows
.\" .Nm ac
.\" to identify and correcty process a logout for the user.  The default
.\" value for
.\" .Pa console
.\" is usually correct at compile time.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rpc.bootparamd
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl r Ar router
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server process that provides information to diskless clients
necessary for booting.
It consults the file
.Pa /etc/bootparams .
It should normally be started from
.Pa /etc/rc .
.Pp
This version will allow the use of aliases on the hostname in the
.Pa /etc/bootparams
file.
The hostname returned in response to the booting client's whoami request
will be the name that appears in the config file, not the canonical name.
In this way you can keep the answer short enough
so that machines that cannot handle long hostnames won't fail during boot.
.Pp
While parsing, if a line containing just
.Dq \&+
is found, and the YP subsystem is active, the YP map
.Pa bootparams
will be searched immediately.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Display the debugging information.
The daemon does not fork in this case.
.It Fl s
Log the debugging information with syslog.
.It Fl r
Set the default router (a hostname or IP address).
This defaults to the machine running the server.
.It Fl f
Specify the file to read boot parameters from.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc/bootparams .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/bootparams -compact
.It Pa /etc/bootparams

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bootparams 5 ,

.Sh AUTHORS
Originally written by Klas Heggemann <klas@@nada.kth.se>
.Sh BUGS
You may find the syslog loggings too verbose.
.Pp
It's not clear if the non-canonical hack mentioned above is a good idea.
.Sh WARNING
If
.Nm rpc.bootparamd
is run on a system which is also running YP, your YP
domainname will be made public information.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

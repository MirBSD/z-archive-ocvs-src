.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a routing daemon which supports RIP over IPv6.
.Pp
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl a
Enables aging of the statically defined routes.
With this option, any
statically defined routes will be removed unless corresponding updates
arrive as if the routes are received at the startup of
.Nm route6d .
.\"
.It Fl R Ar routelog
This option makes
.Nm
log route changes (add/delete) to the file
.Ar routelog .
.\"
.It Fl A Ar prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]
This option is used for aggregating routes.
.Ar prefix/preflen
specifies the prefix and the prefix length of the
aggregated route.
When advertising routes,
.Nm
filters specific routes covered by the aggregate
and advertises the aggregated route
.Ar prefix/preflen
to the interfaces specified in the comma-separated interface list
.Ar if1[,if2...] .
.Nm
creates a static route to
.Ar prefix/preflen ,
with the
.Dv RTF_REJECT
flag set, into the kernel routing table.
.\"
.It Fl d
Enables output of debugging messages.
This option also instructs
.Nm
to run in foreground mode
.Pq i.e., it does not become a daemon process .
.\"
.It Fl D
Enables extensive output of debugging messages.
This option also instructs
.Nm
to run in foreground mode
.Pq i.e., it does not become a daemon process .
.\"
.It Fl h
Disables split horizon processing.
.\"
.It Fl l
By default,
.Nm
will not exchange site local routes for safety reasons.
This is because the semantics of site local address space are rather vague,
as the specification is still being worked on,
and there is no good way to define the site local boundary.
With
.Fl l ,
.Nm
will exchange site local routes as well.
It must not be used on site boundary routers,
since
.Fl l
assumes that all interfaces are in the same site.
.\"
.It Fl L Ar prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]
Filter incoming routes from interfaces
.Ar if1,[if2...] .
.Nm
will accept incoming routes that are in
.Ar prefix/preflen .
If multiple
.Fl L
options are specified, all routes that match any of the options are accepted.
.Li ::/0
is treated specially as default route, not
.Do
any route that has longer prefix length than, or equal to 0
.Dc .
If you would like to accept any route, specify no
.Fl L
option.
For example, with
.Do
.Fl L
.Li 3ffe::/16,if1
.Fl L
.Li ::/0,if1
.Dc
.Nm
will accept the default route and routes in the 6bone test address range,
but no others.
.\"
.It Fl n
Do not update the kernel routing table.
.\"
.It Fl N Ar if1[,if2...]
Do not listen to, or advertise, route from/to interfaces specified by
.Ar if1,[if2...] .
.\"
.It Fl O Ar prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]
Restrict route advertisement toward interfaces specified by
.Ar if1,[if2...] .
With this option
.Nm
will only advertise routes that match
.Ar prefix/preflen .
.\"
.It Fl q
Makes
.Nm
use listen-only mode.
No advertisement is sent.
.\"
.It Fl s
Makes
.Nm
advertise the statically defined routes which exist in the kernel routing
table when
.Nm
is invoked.
Announcements obey the regular split horizon rule.
.\"
.It Fl S
This option is the same as
.Fl s ,
except that the split horizon rule does apply.
.\"
.It Fl T Ar if1[,if2...]
Advertise only the default route toward
.Ar if1,[if2...] .
.\"
.It Fl t Ar tag
Attach the route tag
.Ar tag
to originated route entries.
.Ar tag
can be decimal, octal prefixed by
.Li 0 ,
or hexadecimal prefixed by
.Li 0x .
.\"
.El
.Pp
Upon receipt of signal
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
.Nm
will dump the current internal state into
.Pa /var/run/route6d_dump .
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/route6d_dump -compact
.It Pa /var/run/route6d_dump
contains the internal state dumps created if
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGUSR1
signal
.El

.\"
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
uses the advanced IPv6 API,
defined in RFC2292,
for communicating with peers using link-local addresses.
.Pp
Internally
.Nm
embeds interface identifiers into bits 32 to 63 of link-local addresses
.Po
.Li fe80::xx
and
.Li ff02::xx
.Pc
so they will be visible in the internal state dump file
.Pq Pa /var/run/route6d_dump .
.Pp
Routing table manipulation differs from IPv6 implementation to implementation.
Currently
.Nm
obeys the WIDE Hydrangea/KAME IPv6 kernel,
and will not be able to run on other platforms.
.Pp
Currently,
.Nm
does not reduce the rate of the triggered updates when consecutive updates
arrive.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to

.Sh NAME
.Nm ntpd.conf
.Nd Network Time Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the format of the
.Xr ntpd 8
configuration file.
It has the following format:
.Pp
Empty lines and lines beginning with the
.Sq #
character are ignored.
.Pp
The possible keywords are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic listen on Ar address
Specify a local IP address or a hostname the
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon should listen on.
It can appear multiple times:
.Xr ntpd 8
will listen on each given address.
If
.Sq *
is given as an address,
.Xr ntpd 8
will listen on all local addresses.
.Xr ntpd 8
does not listen on any address by default.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on *
listen on 127.0.0.1
listen on ::1
.Ed
.It Ic server Ar address
Specify the IP address or the hostname of an NTP
server to synchronize to.
If the hostname resolves to multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses,
.Xr ntpd 8
uses the first address.
If it does not get a reply,
.Xr ntpd 8
retries with the next address and continues to do so until a working address
is found.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server 10.0.0.2
server ntp.example.org
.Ed
.It Ic servers Ar address
As with
.Cm server ,
specify the IP address or hostname of an NTP server to synchronize to.
Should the hostname resolve to multiple IP addresses,
.Xr ntpd 8
will try to synchronize to all of them.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
servers pool.ntp.org
.Ed
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/ntpd.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/ntpd.conf

Keywords may be specified multiple times within the configuration file.
They are as follows:
d39 1
a39 1
If it appears multiple times,
d58 1
a58 4
If it appears multiple times,
.Xr ntpd 8
will try to synchronize to all of the servers specified.
If a hostname resolves to multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses,
a69 4
.Pp
To provide redundancy, it is good practice to configure multiple servers.
In general, best accuracy is obtained by using servers that have a low
network latency.
a73 3
If it appears multiple times,
.Xr ntpd 8
will try to synchronize to all of the servers specified.

.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Ar host
\&...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends multiple RPC packets to
.Ar host
and records how many of them were correctly received and how long it took.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar count
Send
.Ar count
packets.
.It Fl d Ar delay
Pause
.Ar delay
microseconds between sending each packet.
.It Fl l Ar length
Set the length of the packet that holds the RPC call message to
.Ar length
bytes.
Not all values of
.Ar length
are possible because RPC data is encoded using XDR.
.Nm
rounds up to the nearest possible value.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is intended for use in network testing, measurement, and management.
This command
.Bf -emphasis
can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@This program is an automounter.

This automounter is a value-added, replacement for the SunOS 4
automount(8) program.  Though based on that program in spirit, it
contains no proprietary UN*X source code.

The version you have here is release 5.3Alpha.

This program is NOT in the Public Domain - it is covered by
the usual Berkeley software distribution license - but feel free
to take it and change it.

It is believed to work correctly on Sun-3's (SunOS 3.5, 4.0, 4.1),
Sun-4's (SunOS 4.0, 4.1), HP-9000/300 (HP-UX, MORE/bsd & BSD 4.3 Reno),
IBM RTs (AOS 4.3), IBM RISC System/6000 (AIX 3.1), VAXen (Ultrix 4.0,
MORE/bsd & BSD 4.3 Reno) and a wide variety of other systems.  If
your machine is not supported please feel free to try a port, but be
sure to send me a record of the changes you had to make.


This is the file text/README.

See the file text/INSTALL for installation instructions.

The documentation is in doc/amdref.texinfo.  This is in GNU TeXinfo format
and you will need a TeX system before you can print it out.

Please forward *all* bug reports to Jan-Simon Pendry <jsp@@doc.ic.ac.uk>
quoting the details of the release and your configuration, which can be
obtained by running the command "amd -v".  Also send any additional
information which may be relevant such as command line options and the maps
being used.  Thanks.

The manual page (amd/amd.8) only lists the command line options.  See the
texinfo document doc/amdref.texinfo for a more detailed discussion.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

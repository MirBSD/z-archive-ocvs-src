.Sh NAME
.Nm amq
.Nd automounter query tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm amq
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl h Ar hostname
.\".Op Fl M Ar mountmap_entry
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Op Ar directory
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm amq
provides a simple way of determining the current state of the
.Xr amd 8
program.
Communication is by
.Tn RPC .
Three modes of operation are supported by the current protocol.
By default a list of mount points and auto-mounted filesystems
is output.
An alternative host can be specified using the
.Fl h
option.
.Pp
If directory names are given, as output by default,
then per-filesystem information is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Request automounter to flush the internal caches.
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Query alternate host
.Ar hostname .
By default the local host is used.
In an
.Tn HP-UX
cluster, the root server is queried by default, since
that is the system on which the automounter is normally run.
.It Fl m
Request the automounter to provide a list of mounted filesystems,
including the number of references to each filesystem and any error
which occurred while mounting.
.It Fl s
Request the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.
.It Fl u
Request the automounter to unmount the named filesystems
instead of providing information about them.
Unmounts are requested, not forced.
They merely cause the mounted filesystem to timeout,
which will be picked up by
.Nm amd Ns \'s
main scheduler thus causing the normal timeout action to be taken.
.It Fl v
Request the automounter to provide version information.
This is a subset of the information provided by
.Xr amd Ns \'s Fl v
option.
.\".It Fl M
.\"Request automounter to add the given map entry to the root map and then
.\"trigger a mount request for it.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

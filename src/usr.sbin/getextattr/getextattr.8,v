.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getextattr
.Nd retrieve a named extended attribute
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ls
.Ar attrnamespace
.Ar attrname
.Ar filename ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a user tool to retrieve a named extended attribute on a file or
directory.
The
.Ar attrnamespace
argument should be the namespace of the attribute to retrieve: legal
values are "user" and "system".
The
.Ar attrname
argument should be the name of the attribute, and
.Ar filename
a list of files and directories from which to retrieve attribute data.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l
Print attributes in the first column and file names in the second.
Can be used only in conjunction with the
.Fl s
option.
.It Fl s
Attempt to display the attribute data as a string, although the
results may not look pretty if the data is binary data.
The
.Xr strvisx 3
function is used to generate the string, so control sequences should
be safely escaped.
Otherwise, the attribute data will be represented as a series of two-digit
hex numbers.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
In order for
.Nm
to succeed, the attribute service must be available on the file system,
and the attribute must be defined for the file queried.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# getextattr system md5 /bsd
/bsd:
  61 61 33 62 39 39 66 65    31 35 35 32 31 62 65 32
  62 36 38 36 62 31 66 39    63 64 33 39 35 36 36 31
# getextattr -s system md5 /bsd
/bsd: "aa3b99fe15521be2b686b1f9cd395661"
.Ed
.Pp
Retrieve the
.Dq md5
extended attribute for the file
.Pa /bsd .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr extattr 2 ,
.Xr extattr 3 ,
.Xr extattrctl 8 ,
.Xr setextattr 8 ,
.Xr extattr 9
.Sh HISTORY
Extended attribute support was developed as part of the TrustedBSD Project.
It was developed to support security extensions requiring additional labels
to be associated with each file or directory.
.Sh AUTHORS
Robert N M Watson
.Sh BUGS
The output format for this utility is ugly, and worse yet, not very useful.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Dt RDATE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rdate
.Nd set the system's date from a remote host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rdate
.Op Fl 46acnprsv
.Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays and sets the local date and time from the
host name or address given as the argument.
The time source may be an RFC 868 TCP protocol server,
which is usually implemented as a built-in service of
.Xr inetd 8 ,
or an RFC 1361 protocol SNTP/NTP server.
By default,
.Nm
uses the RFC 868 TCP protocol.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl a
Use the
.Xr adjtime 2
call to gradually skew the local time to the
remote time rather than just hopping.
.It Fl c
Correct leap seconds.
Usually required when synchronizing to an NTP server.
See below for an example.
.Pp
When synchronizing using the RFC 868 protocol, use this option only if the
server does not correctly account for leap seconds (i.e. if his
.Pa /etc/localtime
link is set to a POSIX, not a RIGHT, time zone).
You can determine if you need this parameter if you sync against an NTP
server (with this parameter) or (recommended) check with a local radio
controlled watch or phone service.
.It Fl n
Use SNTP (RFC 1361) instead of the RFC 868 time protocol.
.It Fl p
Do not set, just print the remote time.
.It Fl r
Show the remainder from the last
.Xr adjtime 2
call.
.It Fl s
Do not print the time.
If set, any previous
.Fl v
options will be ignored.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
Always show the adjustment.
Put this on a command line to reset all previous
.Fl s
options.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/wtmp -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
record of date resets and time changes
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To get the legal time in Germany, set the
.Pa /etc/localtime
symlink to
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo/right/Europe/Berlin
and issue the following command:
.Pp
.D1 Li "# rdate -ncv ptbtime1.ptb.de"
.Pp
The command of course assumes you have a working internet connection
and DNS set up to connect to the server at
.Sy Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
in Braunschweig, Germany, which makes legal time for this country.
.Pp
To gradually adjust time once an hour after the first
.Qq step
adjustment, put the following line into root's crontab:
.Pp
.D1 Li "58  *  *  *  *  rdate -ncav ptbtime1.ptb.de | logger -t NTP"
.Pp
Note that a line similar to the line above is already active
by default in root's crontab of
.Mx .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr adjtime 2 ,
.Xr crontab 1 ,
.Xr gettimeofday 2 ,
.Xr symlink 7 ,
.Xr inetd 8
@


1.9
log
@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

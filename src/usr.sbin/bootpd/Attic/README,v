@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

This is an enhanced version of the CMU BOOTP server which was derived
from the original BOOTP server created by Bill Croft at Stanford.
This version merges all the enhancements and bug-fixes from the
NetBSD, Columbia, and other versions.

Please direct questions, comments, and bug reports to the list:
	<bootp@@andrew.cmu.edu>

You can subscribe to this mailing list by sending mail to:
	bootp-request@@andrew.cmu.edu
(The body of the message should contain: "Add <your-address>")

[ From the NetBSD README file: ]

BOOTPD is a useful adjunct to the nfs diskless boot EPROM code.

The alternatives for initiating a boot of a kernel across a network
are to use RARP protocol, or BOOTP protocol. BOOTP is more flexible;
it allows additional items of information to be returned to the
booting client; it also supports booting across gateways.

[ From the CMU README file: ]

Notes:
1) BOOTP was originally designed and implemented by Bill Croft at Stanford.
   Much of the credit for the ideas and the code goes to him.  We've added
   code to support the vendor specific area of the packet as specified in
   RFC1048.  We've also improved the host lookup algorithm and added some
   extra logging.

2) The server now uses syslog to do logging.  Specifically it uses the 4.3bsd
   version.  I've #ifdef'd all of these calls.  If you are running 4.2 you
   should compile without the -DSYSLOG switch.

3) You must update your /etc/services file to contain the following two lines:
	bootps		67/udp		bootp		# BOOTP Server
	bootpc		68/udp				# BOOTP Client

4) Edit the bootptab.  It has some explanitory comments, and there
   is a manual entry describing its format (bootptab.5)
   If you have any questions, just let us know.

Construction:
    [ See the file Installation which is more up-to-date. -gwr ]

    Make sure all of the files exist first.  If anything is missing,
    please contact either Walt Wimer or Drew Perkins by E-mail or phone.
    Addresses and phone numbers are listed below.

    Type 'make'.  The options at present are: -DSYSLOG which enables logging
    code, -DDEBUG which enables table dumping via signals, and -DVEND_CMU
    which enables the CMU extensions for CMU PC/IP.

    Edit the bootptab.  The man page and the comments in the file should
    explain how to go about doing so.  If you have any problems, let me know.

    Type 'make install'.  This should put all of the files in the right place.

    Edit your /etc/rc.local or /etc/inetd.conf file to start up bootpd upon
    reboot.  The following is a sample /etc/inetd.conf entry:
	# BOOTP server
	bootps dgram udp wait root /usr/etc/bootpd bootpd -i

Care and feeding:
    If you change the interface cards on your host or add new hosts you will
    need to update /etc/bootptab.  Just edit it as before.  Once you write
    it back out, bootpd will notice that there is a new copy and will
    reread it the next time it gets a request.

    If your bootp clients don't get a response then several things might be
    wrong.  Most often, the entry for that host is not in the database.
    Check the hardware address and then check the entry and make sure
    everything is right.  Other problems include the server machine crashing,
    bad cables, and the like.  If your network is very congested you should
    try making your bootp clients send additional requests before giving up.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bootptest
.Nd send BOOTP queries and print responses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bootptest
.Op Fl f Ar bootfile
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl m Ar magic_number
.Ar server-name
.Op Ar template-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends BOOTP requests to the host specified as
.Ar server-name
at one-second intervals until either a response is received,
or until ten requests have gone unanswered.
After a response is received,
.Nm
will wait one more second listening for additional responses.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar bootfile
Fill in the boot file field of the request with
.Ar bootfile .
.It Fl h
Use the hardware (Ethernet) address to identify the client.
By default, the IP address is copied into the request
indicating that this client already knows its IP address.
.It Fl m Ar magic_number
Initialize the first word of the vendor options field with
.Ar magic_number .
.El
.Pp
A
.Ar template-file
may be specified, in which case
.Nm
uses the (binary) contents of this file to initialize the
.Fa options
area of the request packet.
.Sh CREDITS
The bootptest program is a combination of original and derived works.
The main program module (bootptest.c) is original work by
Gordon W. Ross <gwr@@mc.com>.
The packet printing module (print-bootp.c) is a slightly modified
version of a file from the BSD tcpdump program.
.Pp
This program includes software developed by the University of
California, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and its contributors.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

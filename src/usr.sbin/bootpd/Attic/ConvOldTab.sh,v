@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

#   convert_bootptab	Jeroen.Scheerder@@let.ruu.nl 02/25/94
#	This script can be used to convert bootptab files in old format
#	to new (termcap-like) bootptab files
#
# The old format - real entries are commented out by '###'
#
# Old-style bootp files consist of two sections.
# The first section has two entries:
# First, a line that specifies the home directory
# (where boot file paths are relative to)

###/tftpboot

# The next non-empty non-comment line specifies the default bootfile

###no-file

# End of first section - indicated by '%%' at the start of the line

###%%

# The remainder of this file contains one line per client
# interface with the information shown by the table headings
# below. The host name is also tried as a suffix for the
# bootfile when searching the home directory (that is,
# bootfile.host)
#
# Note that htype is always 1, indicating the hardware type Ethernet.
# Conversion therefore always yields ':ha=ether:'.
#
# host	htype	haddr	iaddr	bootfile
#

###somehost	1	00:0b:ad:01:de:ad	128.128.128.128	dummy

# That's all for the description of the old format.
# For the new-and-improved format, see bootptab(5).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

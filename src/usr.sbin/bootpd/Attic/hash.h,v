@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

 * Generalized hash table ADT
 *

 * various data and keys.
 *
 * This package attempts to follow some of the coding conventions suggested
 * by Bob Sidebotham and the AFS Clean Code Committee.
 */


/*
 * The user must supply the following:
 *
 *	1.  A comparison function which is declared as:
 *
 *		int compare(data1, data2)
 *		hash_datum *data1, *data2;
 *
 *	    This function must compare the desired fields of data1 and
 *	    data2 and return TRUE (1) if the data should be considered
 *	    equivalent (i.e. have the same key value) or FALSE (0)
 *	    otherwise.  This function is called through a pointer passed to
 *	    the various hashtable functions (thus pointers to different
 *	    functions may be passed to effect different tests on different
 *	    hash tables).
 *
 *	    Internally, all the functions of this package always call the
 *	    compare function with the "key" parameter as the first parameter,
 *	    and a full data element as the second parameter.  Thus, the key
 *	    and element arguments to functions such as hash_Lookup() may
 *	    actually be of different types and the programmer may provide a
 *	    compare function which compares the two different object types
 *	    as desired.
 *
 *	    Example:
 *
 *		int compare(key, element)
 *		char *key;
 *		struct some_complex_structure *element;
 *		{
 *		    return !strcmp(key, element->name);
 *		}
 *
 *		key = "John C. Doe"
 *		element = &some_complex_structure
 *		hash_Lookup(table, hashcode, compare, key);
 *
 *	2.  A hash function yielding an unsigned integer value to be used
 *	    as the hashcode (index into the hashtable).  Thus, the user
 *	    may hash on whatever data is desired and may use several
 *	    different hash functions for various different hash tables.
 *	    The actual hash table index will be the passed hashcode modulo
 *	    the hash table size.
 *
 *	    A generalized hash function, hash_HashFunction(), is included
 *	    with this package to make things a little easier.  It is not
 *	    guaranteed to use the best hash algorithm in existence. . . .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

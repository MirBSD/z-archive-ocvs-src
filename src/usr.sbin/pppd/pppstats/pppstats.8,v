.Dt PPPSTATS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pppstats
.Nd report statistics for the specified PPP interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pppstats
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl z
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl c Ar count
.Op Fl w Ar secs
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pppstats
utility reports PPP-related statistics at regular intervals for the
specified PPP
.Ar interface .
If the
.Ar interface
is unspecified, it will default to ppp0.
The display is split horizontally
into input and output sections containing columns of statistics
describing the properties and volume of packets received and
transmitted by the interface.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display absolute values rather than deltas.  If this option is
specified with the
.Fl c
and/or
.Fl w
options, the second and subsequent reports (as well as the first) will
show statistics for the time since the link was initiated.
.It Fl c Ar count
Repeat the display
.Ar count
times. The first display is for the time since the link was initiated
(that is, since the corresponding
.Xr pppd 8
was started), and each
subsequent report is for the time period since the last display
(unless the
.Fl a
option is specified).
If this option is not specified, the default repeat
.Ar count
is 1 if the
.Fl w
option is not specified, otherwise infinity.
.It Fl d
Display values in terms of data rate (KB/s) rather than in bytes.
.It Fl r
Display additional statistics summarizing the compression ratio
achieved by the packet compression algorithm in use.
.It Fl v
Display additional statistics demonstrating the efficiency of VJ header
compression and provide more explicit information on the operation
of the algorithm.
.It Fl w Ar wait
Pause
.Ar wait
seconds between each display.
.It Fl z
Instead of the standard display, show statistics indicating the
performance of the packet compression algorithm in use.
.El
.Pp
The following fields are printed on the input side when the
.Fl z
option is not used:
.Bl -tag -width search
.It Li IN
The total number of bytes received by this interface.
.It Li PACK
The total number of packets received by this interface.
.It Li VJCOMP
The number of compressed TCP packets received by this interface.
.It Li VJUNC
The number of uncompressed TCP packets received by this interface.
Not reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Li VJERR
The number of corrupted or bogus TCP packets received by this interface.
Not reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Li VJTOSS
The number of VJ header-compressed TCP packets dropped on reception by
this interface because of preceding errors.  Only reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
.It Li NON-VJ
The total number of non-VJ packets received by this interface. Only
reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
.It Li RATIO
The compression ratio achieved for received packets by the
packet compression scheme in use, defined as the uncompressed size
divided by the compressed size.
Only reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Li UBYTE
The total number of bytes received, after decompression of compressed
packets.  Only reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.El
.Pp
The following fields are printed on the output side:
.Bl -tag -width search
.It Li OUT
The total number of bytes transmitted from this interface.
.It Li PACK
The total number of packets transmitted from this interface.
.It Li VJCOMP
The number of TCP packets transmitted from this interface with
VJ-compressed TCP headers.
.It Li VJUNC
The number of TCP packets transmitted from this interface with
VJ-uncompressed TCP headers.
Not reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Li NON-VJ
The total number of non-VJ packets transmitted from this interface.
Not reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Li VJSRCH
The number of searches for the cached header entry for a VJ header
compressed TCP packet.  Only reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
.It Li VJMISS
The number of failed searches for the cached header entry for a
VJ header compressed TCP packet.  Only reported when the
.Fl v
option is specified.
.It Li RATIO
The compression ratio achieved for transmitted packets by the
packet compression scheme in use, defined as the size
before compression divided by the compressed size.
Only reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Li UBYTE
The total number of bytes to be transmitted, before packet compression
is applied.  Only reported when the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.El
.Pp
When the
.Fl z
option is specified,
.B pppstats
instead displays the following fields, relating to the packet
compression algorithm currently in use.  If packet compression is not
in use, these fields will all display zeroes.  The fields displayed on
the input side are:
.Bl -tag -width search
.It Li COMPRESSED BYTE
The number of bytes of compressed packets received.
.It Li COMPRESSED PACK
The number of compressed packets received.
.It Li INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE
The number of bytes of incompressible packets (that is, those which
were transmitted in uncompressed form) received.
.It Li INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK
The number of incompressible packets received.
.It Li COMP RATIO
The recent compression ratio for incoming packets, defined as the
uncompressed size divided by the compressed size (including both
compressible and incompressible packets).
.El
.Pp
The fields displayed on the output side are:
.Bl -tag -width search
.It Li COMPRESSED BYTE
The number of bytes of compressed packets transmitted.
.It Li COMPRESSED PACK
The number of compressed packets transmitted.
.It Li INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE
The number of bytes of incompressible packets transmitted (that is,
those which were transmitted in uncompressed form).
.It Li INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK
The number of incompressible packets transmitted.
.It Li COMP RATIO
The recent compression ratio for outgoing packets.

.Dt REVNETGROUP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm revnetgroup
.Nd "generate reverse netgroup data"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm revnetgroup
.Fl u
.Fl h
.Op Fl f Ar netgroup_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
processes the contents of a file in
.Xr netgroup 5
format into what is called
.Pa reverse netgroup
form.
That is, where the original file shows
netgroup memberships in terms of which members reside in a particular
group, the reverse netgroup format specifies what groups are associated
with a particular member.
This information is used to generate the
.Pa netgroup.byuser
and
.Pa netgroup.byhosts
YP maps.
These reverse netgroup maps are used to help speed up
netgroup lookups, particularly for the
.Fn innetgr
library function.
.Pp
For example, the standard
.Pa /etc/netgroup
file may list a netgroup and a list of its members.
Here, the netgroup is considered the
.Pa key
and the member names are the
.Pa data .
By contrast, the reverse
.Pa netgroup.byusers
database lists each unique
member as the key and the netgroups to which the members belong become
the data.
Separate databases are created to hold information pertaining
to users and hosts; this allows netgroup username lookups
and netgroup hostname lookups to be performed using independent keyspaces.
.Pp
By constructing these reverse netgroup databases (and the corresponding
YP maps) in advance, the
.Xr getnetgrent 3
library functions are spared from having to work out the dependencies
themselves on the fly.
This is important on networks with large numbers
of users and hosts, since it can take a considerable amount of time
to process very large netgroup databases.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command prints its results on the standard output.
It is usually called only by
.Pa /var/yp/\<domain\>/Makefile
when rebuilding the YP netgroup maps.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u
Generate netgroup.byuser output; only username information in the
original netgroup file is processed.
.It Fl h
Generate netgroup.byhost output; only hostname information in the
original netgroup file is processed. (Note at least one of the
.Fl u
or
.Fl h
flags must be specified.)
.It Op Fl f Ar netgroup_file
The
.Nm
command uses
.Pa /etc/netgroup
as its default input file.
The
.Fl f
flag allows the user to specify an alternate input file.
Specifying
.Dq -
as the input file causes
.Nm
to read from the standard input.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Pa /var/yp/\<domain\>Makefile
The Makefile that calls
.Xr makedbm 8
and
.Nm
to build the YP databases.
.It Pa /etc/netgroup
The default netgroup database file.
This file is most often found only on the YP master server.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ypxfr
.Nd get a YP map from YP server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ypxfr
.Op Fl cf
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl s Ar domain
.Op Fl C Ar tid prog ipadd port
.Ar mapname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ypxfr
is the utility in YP that transfers maps to the local host.
.Pp
Since the YP master transfers a map when it has changed, an YP slave should
check for missed maps regularly.
This can be done via an entry in
.Xr crontab 5 .
The scripts
.Ar ypxfr_1perhour , ypxfr_2perday
and
.Ar ypxfr_1perday
could be used for that.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Don't send a "Clear current map" to local ypserv process.
Useful if ypserv isn't running localy to avoid timeout message.
.It Fl f
Force map transfer, even if version of master is older than local copy.
.It Fl d Ar domain
Don't use default domain, use the specified domain.
.It Fl h Ar host
Get map from host instead of the maps master host.
.It Fl s Ar domain
Specify a source domain other than the target domain.
.It Fl C Ar tid prog ipadd port
This option is only used by ypserv.
This is to open communication with a yppush on another host.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

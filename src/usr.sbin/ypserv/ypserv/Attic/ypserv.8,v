.Sh NAME
.Nm ypserv
.Nd YP server daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ypserv
.Op Fl 1
.Op Fl a Ar aclfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl x
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a fundamental part of the network information system called YP.
This server provides information from YP maps to the YP clients
on the network.
.Pp
A YP map is stored on the server as a
.Xr db 3
database.
A number of YP maps are grouped together in a domain.
.Nm
determines the domains it serves by looking for a directory with
the domain name in
.Pa /var/yp .
.Pp
YP hasn't been known for high security through the years.
In recent years
security has improved by restricting access to the server.
In SunOS 4.1
has a new file occurred named
.Pa /var/yp/securenet .
It contains networks the server can assume is secure.
For information about the file format, see
.Xr securenet 5 .
.Pp
Before the author of this server had seen
.Xr securenet 5
another format,
.Xr ypserv.acl 5 ,
was implemented.
This file format makes it possible to allow and deny hosts and networks
access to the server.
This file can have any name since it's given by the argument to
.Fl a
(use full path).
.Pp
The file used can be reread by sending a
.Dv SIGHUP
to
.Nm ypserv .
The process PID
can be found in the file
.Pa /var/run/ypserv.pid .
.Pp
If a host isn't secure all queries to the server will result in a YP_NODOM
result.
.Pp
If the file
.Pa /var/yp/ypserv.log
exists then messages will be written to the file.
.Pp
If a directory named the same as the system domainname exists in
.Pa /var/yp
(i.e., the domainname is
.Dq foo
and the directory
.Pa /var/yp/foo
exists), then
.Nm
will be automatically started at boot time.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 1
Allow
.Nm
to answer old YP version 1 requests.
.It Fl a Ar aclfile
Don't use
.Pa /var/yp/securenet .
Use another file with a different file format.
For further information see
.Xr ypserv.acl 5 .
.It Fl d
Use Internet Domain Name System.
If a query to map
.Dq hosts.byname
or
.Dq hosts.byaddr
fails, make a DNS query and return the result if successful.
Alternately, if these maps were built on the YP master using
.Nm makedbm
.Fl b
then DNS queries will be done without needing to specify
.Fl d .
.It Fl x
Terminate the server after processing
.Ar aclfile
or
.Pa /var/yp/securenet .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm apm
.Nd Advanced Power Management control program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zzz
.Op Fl Sz
.Op Fl f Ar sockname
.Br
.Nm apm
.Op Fl ablmsSvz
.Op Fl f Ar sockname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
communicates with the Advanced Power Management daemon,
.Xr apmd 8 ,
making requests of it for current power status or to place the system
into a suspend or stand-by state.
With no flags,
.Nm
displays the current power management state in verbose form.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display the external charger (A/C status).
0 means disconnected, 1
means connected, 2 means backup power source, and 255 means unknown.
.It Fl b
Display the battery status.
0 means high, 1 means low, 2 means
critical, 3 means charging, 4 means absent, and 255 means unknown.
.It Fl f Ar sockname
Set the name of the socket via which to contact
.Xr apmd 8
to
.Pa sockname .
.It Fl l
Display the estimated battery lifetime (in percent).
.It Fl m
Display the estimated battery lifetime (in minutes).
.It Fl S
Put the system into stand-by (light sleep) mode.
.It Fl s
Display if power management is enabled.
.It Fl v
Request more verbose description of the displayed states.
.It Fl z
Put the system into suspend (deep sleep) mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm zzz
variant on this command is an alternative for suspending the system.
With no arguments,
.Nm zzz
places the system into suspend mode.
The command line flags serve the same purpose as for the
.Nm
variant of this command.
.Pp
This command does not wait for positive confirmation that the requested
mode has been entered; to do so would mean the command does not return
until the system resumes from its sleep state.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/apmdev -compact
.It Pa /var/run/apmdev
default Unix domain socket for communicating with
.Xr apmd 8
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl f
flag may be used to specify an alternate socket name.
The protection modes on this socket govern which users may access the
APM functions.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apm 4 ,
.Xr apmd 8
.Sh REFERENCES
Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS Interface Specification (revision
1.2), Intel Corporation and Microsoft Corporation
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx 1.3 ,
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 1.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

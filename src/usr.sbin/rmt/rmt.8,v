.Sh NAME
.Nm rmt
.Nd remote magtape protocol module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rmt
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program used by the remote dump and restore programs
in manipulating a magnetic tape drive through an interprocess
communication connection.
.Nm
is normally started up with an
.Xr rcmd 3
or
.Xr rcmdsh 3
call.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program accepts requests specific to the manipulation of
magnetic tapes, performs the commands, then responds with
a status indication.
All responses are in
.Tn ASCII
and in
one of two forms.
Successful commands have responses of:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Sm off
.Sy A Ar number No \en
.Sm on
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar number
is an
.Tn ASCII
representation of a decimal number.
Unsuccessful commands are responded to with:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Sm off
.Xo Sy E Ar error-number
.No \en Ar error-message
.No \en
.Xc
.Sm on
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar error-number
is one of the possible error
numbers described in
.Xr intro 2
and
.Ar error-message
is the corresponding error string as printed
from a call to
.Xr perror 3 .
The protocol is comprised of the
following commands, which are sent as indicated - no spaces are supplied
between the command and its arguments, or between its arguments, and
.Ql \en
indicates that a newline should be supplied:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.Sm off
.It Xo Sy \&O Ar device
.No \en Ar mode No \en
.Xc
Open the specified
.Ar device
using the indicated
.Ar mode .
.Ar device
is a full pathname and
.Ar mode
is an
.Tn ASCII
representation of a decimal
number suitable for passing to
.Xr open 2 .
If a device had already been opened, it is
closed before a new open is performed.
.It Xo Sy C Ar device No \en
.Xc
Close the currently open device.
The
.Ar device
specified is ignored.
.It Xo Sy L
.Ar offset No \en
.Ar whence No \en
.Xc
.Sm on
Perform an
.Xr lseek 2
operation using the specified parameters.
The response value is that returned from the
.Xr lseek
call.
.Sm off
.It Sy W Ar count No \en
.Sm on
Write data onto the open device.
.Nm
reads
.Ar count
bytes from the connection, aborting if
a premature end-of-file is encountered.
The response value is that returned from
the
.Xr write 2
call.
.Sm off
.It Sy R Ar count No \en
.Sm on
Read
.Ar count
bytes of data from the open device.
If
.Ar count
exceeds the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it is
truncated to the data buffer size.
.Nm
then performs the requested
.Xr read 2
and responds with
.Sm off
.Sy A Ar count-read No \en
.Sm on
if the read was
successful; otherwise an error in the
standard format is returned.
If the read was successful, the data read is then sent.
.Sm off
.It Xo Sy I Ar operation
.No \en Ar count No \en
.Xc
.Sm on
Perform an
.Dv MTIOCOP
.Xr ioctl 2
command using the specified parameters.
The parameters are interpreted as the
.Tn ASCII
representations of the decimal values
to place in the
.Ar mt_op
and
.Ar mt_count
fields of the structure used in the
.Fn ioctl
call.
The return value is the
.Ar count
parameter when the operation is successful.
.It Sy S
Return the status of the open device, as
obtained with a
.Dv MTIOCGET
.Xr ioctl
call.
If the operation was successful, an
.Dq ack
is sent with the size of the status buffer, then the status buffer is
sent (in binary).
.El
.Sm on
.Pp
Any other command causes
.Nm
to exit.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
All responses are of the form described above.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rcmd 3 ,
.Xr rcmdsh 3 ,
.Xr mtio 4 ,
.Xr rdump 8 ,
.Xr rrestore 8
.Sh BUGS
People tempted to use this for a remote file access protocol
are discouraged.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm trpt
.Nd transliterate protocol trace
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm trpt
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl j
.Op Fl p Ar hex-address
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interrogates the buffer of
.Tn TCP
trace records created
when a socket is marked for
.Dq debugging
(see
.Xr setsockopt 2 ) ,
and prints a readable description of these records.
When no options are supplied,
.Nm
prints all the trace records found in the system
grouped according to
.Tn TCP
connection protocol control
block
.Pq Tn PCB .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
In addition to the normal output,
print the values of the source and destination
addresses for each packet recorded.
.It Fl f
Follow the trace as it occurs, waiting a short time for additional records
each time the end of the log is reached.
.It Fl j
Just give a list of the protocol control block
addresses for which there are trace records.
.It Fl p
Show only trace records associated with the protocol
control block at the given address
.Ar hex-address .
.It Fl s
In addition to the normal output,
print a detailed description of the packet
sequencing information.
.It Fl t
In addition to the normal output,
print the values for all timers at each
point in the trace.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from
.Pa core
instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from
.Pa system
instead of the running kernel.
.El
.Pp
The recommended use of
.Nm
is as follows.
Isolate the problem and enable debugging on the
socket(s) involved in the connection.
Find the address of the protocol control blocks
associated with the sockets using the
.Fl A
option to
.Xr netstat 1 .
Then run
.Nm
with the
.Fl p
option, supplying the associated
protocol control block addresses.
The
.Fl f
option can be used to follow the trace log once the trace is located.
If there are
many sockets using the debugging option, the
.Fl j
option may be useful in checking to see if
any trace records are present for the socket in
question.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr setsockopt 2
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy no namelist
When the system image doesn't
contain the proper symbols to find the trace buffer;
others which should be self explanatory.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Should also print the data for each input or output,
but this is not saved in the trace record.
.Pp
The output format is inscrutable and should be described
here.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

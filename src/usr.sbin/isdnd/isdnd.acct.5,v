.Sh NAME
.Nm isdnd.acct
.Nd isdn4bsd ISDN management daemon accounting file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa isdnd.acct
contains accounting information which is written if the variable
.Em useacctfile
in the
.Xr isdnd 8
configuration file
.Xr isdnd.rc 5
is set to
.Em on
and charging information transmission has been subscribed for the
ISDN connection (AOCD or AOCE).
.Pp
If the variable
.Em acctall
is set to
.Em on ,
accounting information is written even if the local site was not charged
or no charging information is available or is not subscribed.
.Pp
The general format of an accounting line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl FROM - UNTIL NAME UNITS (SECONDS) (INBYTES/OUTBYTES)
.Pp
.Em FROM
is the time the connection was established in the format
.Dl Day.Month.Year Hour:Minutes:seconds
.Pp
.Em UNTIL
is the time the connection was closed.
The format is the same as
described for
.Em FROM
above.
.Pp
.Em NAME
is the symbolic name got from the
.Em name
entry of the
.Xr isdnd.rc 5
config file for this connection.
.Pp
.Em UNITS
is the amount of charging units billed for the connection.
.Pp
.Em SECONDS
is the number of seconds the connection lasted.
.Pp
.Em INBYTES
and
.Em OUTBYTES
is the (optional) number of bytes that were transferred.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/isdnd.acct -compact
.It Pa /var/log/isdnd.acct
The default accounting information file for the
.Nm isdnd
ISDN daemon.

@pull in the remaining ISDN man pages and the daemon from NetBSD,
replacing the postcard-ware ones

I still think it's okay to send Hellmuth a postcard, though.

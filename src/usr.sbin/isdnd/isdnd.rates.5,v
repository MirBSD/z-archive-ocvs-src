.Sh NAME
.Nm isdnd.rates
.Nd isdn4bsd ISDN management daemon rates description file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa isdnd.rates
contains descriptions how long charging units last at a given time of day,
day of week and the distance to the destination.
If this file is available, this information may be used by the
.Xr isdnd 8
ISDN connection management daemon to calculate the short hold time for a
connection.
.Pp
The format of a rate entry line is as follows:
.Pp
The first field, the
.Pq Fa rate-code
defines a collection of rates (for each day of the week) which can be
referenced in the
.Xr isdnd 8
configuration file
.Xr isdnd.rc 5 .
This field must start with the identifier
.Dq ra
followed by a digit in the range of zero to four.
.Pp
The second field, the
.Pq Fa day-number
selects the day of week for which this entry defines the rates, where 0 stands
for Sunday, 1 for Monday and so on until the digit 6 which stands for Saturday.
.Pp
The rest of the line consists of one or more space separated fields which have
the following syntax:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
start_hour.start_minutes-end_hour.end_minutes:charge_unit_length
.Ed
.Pp
Start_hour and start_minutes define the begin of a time section and end_hour
and end_minutes define the end.
Charge_unit_length define the length of a
charging unit in the previously defined time section.
No spaces or tabs are allowed inside this field.
The hour and minutes specifications MUST have
exactly 2 digits, in case just one digit is needed, a leading 0 must be used.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -filled -offset indent
14.00-18.00:90
.Ed
.Pp
defines, that between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM the length of one charging unit
lasts 90 seconds.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/isdn/isdnd.rates -compact
.It Pa /etc/isdn/isdnd.rates
The default rates specification file for the
.Nm isdnd
ISDN daemon.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The line:
.Bd -literal
ra0 0 00.00-05.00:240 05.00-21.00:150 21.00-24.00:240
.Ed
.Pp
defines the unit lengths for a Sunday.

.Xr isdnd 8
daemon to which
.Nm
belongs was designed and written by

@pull in the remaining ISDN man pages and the daemon from NetBSD,
replacing the postcard-ware ones

I still think it's okay to send Hellmuth a postcard, though.

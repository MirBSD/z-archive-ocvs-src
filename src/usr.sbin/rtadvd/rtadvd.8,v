.Sh NAME
.Nm rtadvd
.Nd router advertisement daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dDfMRs
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Ar interface ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends router advertisement packets to the specified
.Ar interfaces .
.Pp
The program will daemonize itself on invocation.
It will then send router advertisement packets periodically, as well
as in response to router solicitation messages sent by end hosts.
.Pp
Router advertisements can be configured on a per-interface basis, as
described in
.Xr rtadvd.conf 5 .
.Pp
If there is no configuration file entry for an interface,
or if the configuration file does not exist altogether,
.Nm
sets all the parameters to their default values.
In particular,
.Nm
reads all the interface routes from the routing table and advertises
them as on-link prefixes.
.Pp
.Nm
also watches the routing table.
By default, if an interface direct route is
added/deleted on an advertising interface and no static prefixes are
specified by the configuration file,
.Nm
adds/deletes the corresponding prefix to/from its advertising list,
respectively.
The
.Fl s
option may be used to disable this behavior.
Moreover, if the status of an advertising interface changes,
.Nm
will start or stop sending router advertisements according
to the latest status.
.Pp
Basically, hosts MUST NOT send Router Advertisement messages at any
time (RFC 2461, Section 6.2.3).
However, it would sometimes be useful to allow hosts to advertise some
parameters such as prefix information and link MTU.
Thus,
.Nm
can be invoked if router lifetime is explicitly set zero on every
advertising interface.
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl c
Specify an alternate location,
.Ar configfile ,
for the configuration file.
By default,
.Pa /etc/rtadvd.conf
is used.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
.It Fl f
Foreground mode (useful when debugging).
Log messages will be dumped to stderr when this option is specified.
.It Fl M
Specify an interface to join the all-routers site-local multicast group.
By default,
.Nm
tries to join the first advertising interface appearing on the command
line.
This option has meaning only with the
.Fl R
option, which enables routing renumbering protocol support.
.\".It Fl m
.\"Enables mobile IPv6 support.
.\"This changes the content of router advertisement option, as well as
.\"permitted configuration directives.
.It Fl R
Accept router renumbering requests.
If you enable it, certain IPsec setup is suggested for security reasons.
.\"On KAME-based systems,
.\".Xr rrenumd 8
.\"generates router renumbering request packets.
This option is currently disabled, and is ignored by
.Nm
with a warning message.
.It Fl s
Do not add or delete prefixes dynamically.
Only statically configured prefixes, if any, will be advertised.
.El
.Pp
Upon receipt of signal
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
.Nm
will dump the current internal state into
.Pa /var/run/rtadvd.dump .
.Pp
Use
.Dv SIGTERM
to kill
.Nm
gracefully.
In this case,
.Nm
will transmit router advertisement with router lifetime 0
to all the interfaces
.Pq in accordance with RFC2461 6.2.5 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
program exits 0 on success, and >0 on failures.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /etc/rtadvd.conf
The default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/rtadvd.pid
contains the pid of the currently running
.Nm rtadvd .
.It Pa /var/run/rtadvd.dump
The file in which
.Nm
dumps its internal state.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rtadvd.conf 5 ,
.Xr rtsol 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in the WIDE Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Sh BUGS
There used to be some text that recommended users not to let
.Nm
advertise Router Advertisement messages on an upstream link to avoid
undesirable
.Xr icmp6 4
redirect messages.
However, based on the later discussion in the IETF IPng working group,
all routers should rather advertise the messages regardless of
the network topology, in order to ensure reachability.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

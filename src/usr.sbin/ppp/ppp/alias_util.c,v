/*
    Alias_util.c contains general utilities used by other functions
    in the packet aliasing module.  At the moment, there are functions
    for computing IP header and TCP packet checksums.

    The checksum routines are based upon example code in a Unix networking
    text written by Stevens (sorry, I can't remember the title -- but
    at least this is a good author).

    Initial Version:  August, 1996  (cjm)

    Version 1.7:  January 9, 1997
         Added differential checksum update function.
*/

/*
Note: the checksum routines assume that the actual checksum word has
been zeroed out.  If the checksum word is filled with the proper value,
then these routines will give a result of zero (useful for testing
purposes);

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@it's convenient to be able to vnconfig read-only files and devices,
but it's even more convenient to be able to unconfigure them afterwards :)

.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig
.Nd "configure vnode disks for file swapping or pseudo file systems"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vnconfig
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl vkr
.Ar rawdev
.Ar regular_file
.Nm vnconfig Fl u
.Op Fl vr
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate (or disassociate) the special file
.Ar rawdev
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
Both traditional devices,
.Pa vnd ,
and the cache-coherent devices,
.Pa svnd ,
are configured through
.Nm vnconfig .
.Pp
If you read the regular file while using
.Pa svnd ,
you need to mount the
.Pa svnd
with the mount option
.Ar sync
to ensure consistency in the buffer cache.
For normal operation this is not necessary.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar rawdev
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
This is the default operation.
.It Fl k
Associate an encryption key with the device.
All data will be encrypted before it is written to the disk.
Encryption only works with
.Pa svnd .
.It Fl r
If the kernel supports it, don't write to the underlying file.
This is supported since
.Mx 7 .
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
If the device was configured read-only, you must use the
.Fl r
option while unconfiguring, or you will get an error.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rvnd?? -compact
.It Pa /dev/{,r}{,s}vnd*
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure the vnode disk
.Pa svnd0
(all of its partitions become usable):
.Pp
.Dl # vnconfig svnd0 /tmp/diskimage
.Pp
Unconfigure the same device:
.Pp
.Dl # vnconfig -u svnd0
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vnd 4 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr swapon 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh BUGS
This command should really be named
.Nm vndconfig .

@(hopefully) implement read-only-ability for vnd devices.
while here, protect vndioctl.h against multiple includes.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.TH fs1toppm 1 "21 February 1994"
.SH NAME
fs1toppm - convert the output from the Ricoh FS1 scanner to PPM format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fs1toppm
.I <width in pixels> <height in pixels>
.I <FS1 file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fs1toppm
reads the width and height in pixels of the scanner image
data as a decimal integer from the command line and the scanner image
data from the file specified on the command line.
It writes the data out in a format compatible with Portable Pix Map
(PPM) "rawbits".
.PP
This program was written because the color data format used by
the Ricoh FS1 scanner and Portable Pix Map (PPM) are incompatible.
In PPM the red, green and blue samples are interleaved at the pixel level;
the Ricoh FS1 interleaves them at the row level.
.PP
The
.I grabscan
script uses
.I fs1toppm
internally.
.SH EXAMPLES
fs1toppm 100 200 picture.fs1 >picture.ppm
.SH SEE ALSO
ppm(5)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

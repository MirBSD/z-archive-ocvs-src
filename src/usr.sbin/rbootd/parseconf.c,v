**  ParseAddr -- Parse a string containing an RMP address.
**
**	This routine is fairly liberal at parsing an RMP address.  The
**	address must contain 6 octets consisting of between 0 and 2 hex
**	chars (upper/lower case) separated by colons.  If two colons are
**	together (e.g. "::", the octet between them is recorded as being
**	zero.  Hence, the following addrs are all valid and parse to the
**	same thing:
**
**		08:00:09:00:66:ad	8::9:0:66:AD	8::9::66:aD
**
**	For clarity, an RMP address is really an Ethernet address, but
**	since the HP boot code uses IEEE 802.3, it's really an IEEE
**	802.3 address.  Of course, all of these are identical.
**
**	Parameters:
**		str - string representation of an RMP address.
**
**	Returns:
**		pointer to a static array of RMP_ADDRLEN bytes.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		None.
**
**	Warnings:
**		- The return value points to a static buffer; it must
**		  be copied if it's to be saved.

1.2
log
@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

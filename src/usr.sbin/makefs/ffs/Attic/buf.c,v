@makefs(8) leaves, too
would be nice to have, but no fix for problem in sight
(weird: same problem existed on some sparcstation 20 with a 50 MHz
 CPU using vnd(4) during the release process, but not on the ss20
 with 75 MHz CPU I have now)

@fix... now we get the same error as when we used
the *vnd devices on a sparcstation 50 MHz (my new
70 MHz one is fine) -> maybe this helps tracking
down the newfs(8) error as well?

again: this does not work correctly. why?

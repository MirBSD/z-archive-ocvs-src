.TH dhcp-options 5
.SH NAME
dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.B options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.   When configuring
.B dhcpd(8)
or
.B dhclient(8) ,
options must often be declared.   The syntax for declaring options,
and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are
documented here.
.SH REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
.PP
DHCP \fIoption\fR statements always start with the \fIoption\fR
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.  The
option names and data formats are described below.   It is not
necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.PP
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.PP
The
.B ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
.PP
The
.B int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.   The 
.B uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.   The 
.B int16
and
.B uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.   The 
.B int8
and
.B uint8
data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.PP
The
.B string
data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a domain-name
option, the syntax would be
.nf
.sp 1
	option domain-name "isc.org";
.fi
.PP
The
.B flag
data type specifies a boolean value.   Booleans can be either true or
false (or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.PP
The
.B data-string
data type specifies either an NVT ASCII string
enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.   For example:
.nf
.sp 1
	option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
or
	option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.fi
.PP
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.   Options which
are not listed by name may be defined by the name option-\fInnn\fR,
where \fInnn\fR is the decimal number of the option code.   These
options may be followed either by a string, enclosed in quotes, or by
a series of octets, expressed as two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated
by colons.   For example:
.PP
.nf
	option option-133 "my-option-133-text";
	option option-129 1:54:c9:2b:47;
.fi
.PP
Because dhcpd does not know the format of these undefined option codes,
no checking is done to ensure the correctness of the entered data.
.PP
The standard options are:
.PP
.B option subnet-mask \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The subnet mask option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC
950.  If no subnet mask option is provided anywhere in scope, as a
last resort dhcpd will use the subnet mask from the subnet declaration
for the network on which an address is being assigned.  However,
.I any
subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the address being
assigned will override the subnet mask specified in the subnet
declaration.
.RE

The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs.  The first address
is the destination address, and the second address is the router for
the destination.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

d45 2
a46 3
services that are available on the network.
When configuring
.Xr dhcpd 8
d48 12
a59 14
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
options must often be declared.
The syntax for declaring options, and the names and formats of the options
that can be declared, are documented here.
.Sh REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
DHCP
.Ic option
statements always start with the
.Ic option
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.
The option names and data formats are described below.
It is not necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options \-
only those options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.Pp
d61 1
a61 13
.Pp
The
.Ar ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP address
(e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g., haagen.isc.org).
A domain name must resolve to a single IP address.
.Pp
The
.Ar int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.
The
.Ar uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.
d63 12
a74 1
.Ar int16
d76 3
a78 4
.Ar uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.
The
.Ar int8
d80 1
a80 1
.Ar uint8
d83 1
a83 12
.Pp
The
.Ar string
data type specifies an
.Tn NVT
.Pq Network Virtual Terminal
.Tn ASCII
string, which must be enclosed in double quotes \- for example,
to specify a domain-name option, the syntax would be
.Pp
.Dl option domain-name \&"isc.org\&";
.Pp
d85 22
a106 14
.Ar flag
data type specifies a boolean value.
Booleans can be either true or false
(or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.Pp
The
.Ar data-string
data type specifies either an
.Tn NVT ASCII
string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl option dhcp-client-identifier \&"CLIENT-FOO\&";
d108 3
a110 2
.Dl option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.Pp
d112 4
a115 7
from the IETF draft document on DHCP options, RFC 2132.
Options which are not listed by name may be defined by the name
.Pf option\- Ns Ar nnn ,
where
.Ar nnn
is the decimal number of the option code.
These options may be followed either by a string, enclosed in quotes, or by
d117 8
a124 11
by colons.
For example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option option-133 "my-option-133-text";
option option-129 1:54:c9:2b:47;
.Ed
.Pp
Because
.Xr dhcpd 8
does not know the format of these undefined option codes,

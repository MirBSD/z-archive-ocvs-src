@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

 * Routing Table Entry, one per subnet from which a multicast could originate.
 * (Note: all addresses, subnet numbers and masks are kept in NETWORK order.)
 *
 * The Routing Table is stored as a doubly-linked list of these structures,
 * ordered by decreasing value of rt_originmask and, secondarily, by
 * decreasing value of rt_origin within each rt_originmask value.
 * This data structure is efficient for generating route reports, whether
 * full or partial, for processing received full reports, for clearing the
 * CHANGED flags, and for periodically advancing the timers in all routes.
 * It is not so efficient for updating a small number of routes in response
 * to a partial report.  In a stable topology, the latter are rare; if they
 * turn out to be costing a lot, we can add an auxiliary hash table for
 * faster access to arbitrary route entries.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

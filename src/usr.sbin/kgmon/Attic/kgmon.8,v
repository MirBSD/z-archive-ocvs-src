.Sh NAME
.Nm kgmon
.Nd generate a dump of the operating system's profile buffers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kgmon
.Op Fl bhpr
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm kgmon
is a tool used when profiling the operating system.
When no arguments are supplied,
.Nm kgmon
indicates the state of operating system profiling as
.Dq running ,
.Dq off ,
or
.Dq not configured
(see
.Xr config 8 ) .
If the
.Fl p
flag is specified,
.Nm kgmon
extracts profile data from the operating system and produces a
.Pa gmon.out
file suitable for later analysis by
.Xr gprof 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Resume the collection of profile data.
.It Fl h
Stop the collection of profile data.
.It Fl p
Dump the contents of the profile buffers into a
.Pa gmon.out
file.
.It Fl r
Reset all the profile buffers.
If the
.Fl p
flag is also specified, the
.Pa gmon.out
file is generated before the buffers are reset.
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
default
.Pa /bsd .
.El
.Pp
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl h
is specified, the state of profiling collection remains unchanged.
For example, if the
.Fl p
flag is specified and profile data is being collected,
profiling will be momentarily suspended,
the operating system profile buffers will be dumped,
and profiling will be immediately resumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmemx -compact
.It Pa /bsd
default system
.It Pa /dev/kmem
default memory
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gprof 1 ,
.Xr config 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Users with only read permission on
.Pa /dev/kmem
cannot change the state
of profiling collection.
They can get a
.Pa gmon.out
file with the warning that the data may be
inconsistent if profiling is in progress.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

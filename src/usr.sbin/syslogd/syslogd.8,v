.Sh NAME
.Nm syslogd
.Nd log systems messages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm syslogd
.Bk -words
.Op Fl dnu
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Op Fl m Ar mark_interval
.Op Fl a Ar path
.Op Fl p Ar log_socket
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads and logs messages to the system console, log files, other
machines and/or users as specified by its configuration file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging to the standard output,
and do not disassociate from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Specify the pathname of an alternate configuration file;
the default is
.Pa /etc/syslog.conf .
.It Fl m Ar mark_interval
Select the number of minutes between
.Dq mark
messages; the default is 20 minutes.
.It Fl n
Print source addresses numerically rather than symbolically.
This saves an address-to-name lookup for each incoming message,
which can be useful when combined with the
.Fl u
option on a loghost with no DNS cache.  Messages from the local
host will still be logged with the symbolic local host name.
.It Fl u
Select the historical
.Dq insecure
mode, in which syslogd will
accept input from the UDP port.
Some software wants this, but you can be subjected to a variety of
attacks over the network, including attackers remotely filling logs.
.It Fl p Ar log_socket
Specify the pathname of an alternate log socket to be used instead;
the default is
.Pa /dev/log .
.It Fl a Pa path
Specify a location where
.Nm
should place an additional log socket.
Up to about 20 additional logging sockets can be specified.
The primary use for this is to place additional log sockets in
.Pa /dev/log
of various chroot filespaces.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
reads its configuration file when it starts up and whenever it
receives a hangup signal.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.Xr syslog.conf 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
opens an Internet domain socket as specified
in
.Pa /etc/services .
Normally
.Nm
will only use this socket to send messages outwards, but in
.Dq insecure
mode it will also read messages from this socket.
.Nm
also opens and reads messages from the
.Tn UNIX
domain socket
.Pa /dev/log ,
and from the special device
.Pa /dev/klog
(to read kernel messages).
.Pp
.Nm
opens the above described socket whether or not it is
running in secure mode.
If
.Nm
is running in secure mode, all incoming data on this socket is discarded.
The socket is required for sending forwarded messages.
.Pp
.Nm
creates the file
.Pa /var/run/syslog.pid ,
and stores its process ID there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.Nm syslogd .
.Pp
The message sent to
.Nm
should consist of a single line.
The message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding
decimal number in angle braces, for example,
.Dq Aq 5 .
This priority code should map into the priorities defined in the
include file
.Aq Pa sys/syslog.h .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/syslog.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/syslog.conf
configuration file
.It Pa /var/run/syslog.pid
process ID of current
.Nm syslogd
.It Pa /dev/log
name of the
.Tn UNIX
domain datagram log socket
.It Pa /dev/klog
kernel log device
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr logger 1 ,
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr services 5 ,
.Xr syslog.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

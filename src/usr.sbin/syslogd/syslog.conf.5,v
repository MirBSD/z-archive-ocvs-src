.Sh NAME
.Nm syslog.conf
.Nd
.Xr syslogd 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm syslog.conf
file is the configuration file for the
.Xr syslogd 8
program.
It consists of blocks of lines separated by
.Em program
specifications, with each line containing two fields: the
.Em selector
field which specifies the types of messages and priorities to which the
line applies, and an
.Em action
field which specifies the action to be taken if a message
.Xr syslogd
receives matches the selection criteria.
The
.Em selector
field is separated from the
.Em action
field by one or more tab characters.
.Pp
The
.Em selectors
function
is encoded as a
.Em facility ,
a period
.Pq Ql \&. ,
and a
.Em level ,
with no intervening whitespace.
Both the
.Em facility
and the
.Em level
are case insensitive.
.Pp
The
.Em facility
describes the part of the system generating the message, and is one of
the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail,
mark, news, syslog, user, uucp and local0 through local7.
These keywords (with the exception of mark) correspond to the
similar
.Dq Dv LOG_
values specified to the
.Xr openlog 3
and
.Xr syslog 3
library routines.
.Pp
The
.Em level
describes the severity of the message, and is a keyword from the
following ordered list (highest to lowest): emerg, alert, crit, err,
warning, notice, info and debug.
These keywords correspond to the
similar
.Pq Dv LOG_
values specified to the
.Xr syslog
library routine.
.Pp
Each block of lines is separated from the previous block by a tag.
The tag is a line beginning with
.Em !prog
and each block will be associated with calls to syslog from that specific
program.
.Pp
See
.Xr syslog 3
for further descriptions of both the
.Em facility
and
.Em level
keywords and their significance.
It's preferred that selections be made on
.Em facility
rather than
.Em program ,
since the latter can easily vary in a networked environment.
In some cases, though, an appropriate
.Em facility
simply doesn't exist.
.Pp
If a received message matches the specified
.Em facility
and is of the specified
.Em level
.Pq Em or a higher level ,
and the first word in the message after the date matches the
.Em program ,
the action specified in the
.Em action
field will be taken.
.Pp
Multiple
.Em selectors
may be specified for a single
.Em action
by separating them with semicolon
.Pq Ql \&;
characters.
It is important to note, however, that each
.Em selector
can modify the ones preceding it.
.Pp
Multiple
.Em facilities
may be specified for a single
.Em level
by separating them with comma
.Pq Ql \&,
characters.
.Pp
An asterisk
.Pq Ql *
can be used to specify all
.Em facilities ,
all
.Em levels
or all
.Em programs .
.Pp
The special
.Em facility
.Dq mark
receives a message at priority
.Dq info
every 20 minutes (see
.Xr syslogd 8 ) .
This is not enabled by a
.Em facility
field containing an asterisk.
.Pp
The special
.Em level
.Dq none
disables a particular
.Em facility .
.Pp
The
.Em action
field of each line specifies the action to be taken when the
.Em selector
field selects a message.
There are four forms:
.Bl -bullet
.It
A pathname (beginning with a leading slash).
Selected messages are appended to the file.
.It
A hostname (preceded by an at
.Pq Ql @@
sign).
Selected messages are forwarded to the
.Xr syslogd
program on the named host.
.It
A comma separated list of users.
Selected messages are written to those users
if they are logged in.
.It
An asterisk.
Selected messages are written to all logged-in users.
.El
.Pp
Blank lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a hash
.Pq Ql #
character are ignored.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A configuration file might appear as follows:
.Bd -literal
# Log all kernel messages, authentication messages of
# level notice or higher and anything of level err or
# higher to the console.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv.none	/dev/console

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none		/var/log/messages

# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*						/var/log/secure

# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*							/var/log/maillog

# Everybody gets emergency messages, plus log them on another
# machine.
*.emerg							*
*.emerg							@@arpa.berkeley.edu

# Root and Eric get alert and higher messages.
*.alert							root,eric

# Save mail and news errors of level err and higher in a
# special file.
uucp,news.crit						/var/log/spoolerr

# Save ftpd transactions along with mail and news
!ftpd
*.*                                                     /var/log/spoolerr
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/syslog.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/syslog.conf
The
.Xr syslogd 8
configuration file.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not intuitive.
For example
.Dq mail.crit,*.err
will select
.Dq mail
facility messages at the level of
.Dq err
or higher, not at the level of
.Dq crit
or higher.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

Selected messages are written to an in-memory buffer that may be read using

                            Apache 1.3.28 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.28 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.28
   as compared to 1.3.27.

   This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
   particular note is that 1.3.28 addresses and fixes 3 potential
   security issues:

    o CAN-2003-0460 (cve.mitre.org): Fix the rotatelogs support program on
      Win32 and OS/2 to ignore special control characters received over the
      pipe.  Previously such characters could cause it to quit logging and
      exit.  We would like to thank the Hitachi Incident Response team for
      their responsible disclosure of this issue.

    o VU#379828 : The server could crash when going into an infinite loop
      due to too many subsequent internal redirects and nested subrequests. 
   
    o Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child processes, such
      as CGI scripts.

   We consider Apache 1.3.28 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.28 is available for download from
   
       http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
                - or -
       http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/

   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.

   Binary distributions are available from

       http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/

   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at

       http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available. Win32
   binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
   technology.  While development continues to make this installation method
   more robust, questions should be directed to the
   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see
   
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While  the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its 
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to 
   Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms.

                     Apache 1.3.28 Major changes

  Security vulnerabilities

     * CAN-2003-0460 (cve.mitre.org): Fix the rotatelogs support program on
       Win32 and OS/2 to ignore special control characters received over the
       pipe.  Previously such characters could cause it to quit logging and
       exit.  We would like to thank the Hitachi Incident Response team for
       their responsible disclosure of this issue.

     * VU#379828 : The server could crash when going into an infinite loop
       due to too many subsequent internal redirects and nested subrequests. 
   
     * Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child processes, such
       as CGI scripts.

  New features

   The main new features in 1.3.28 (compared to 1.3.27) are:

     * Added new ap_register_cleanup_ex() API function which allows
       for a "magic" cleanup function to be run at register time
       rather than at cleanup time. 

     * Improvements to mod_usertrack that allows for a regular (verbose)
       as well as "compact" version of the tracking cookie (the new
       'CookieFormat' directive), and the ability to prepend a string
       to the cookie via the 'CookiePrefix' directive.

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Introduce Win32 .pdb diagnostic symbols into the Apache 1.3 build
       (as created in Apache 2.0.45 and later.)  which akes debugging and
       analysis of crash dumps and Dr. Watson logs trivial.

     * AIX: Change the default accept mechanism from pthread back to
       fcntl.

  Bugs fixed

   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.27 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.28:

     * Make sure the accept mutex is released before calling child exit
       hooks and cleanups.

     * Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs.  The escaping routines
       now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
       appended if supported by the particular scheme.

     * Prevent obscenely large values of precision in ap_vformatter
       from clobbering a buffer.

     * Update timeout algorithm in free_proc_chain. If a subprocess
       did not exit immediately, the thread would sleep for 3 seconds
       before checking the subprocess exit status again. In a very
       common case when the subprocess was an HTTP server CGI script,
       the CGI script actually exited a fraction of a second into the 3
       second sleep, which effectively limited the server to serving one 
       CGI request every 3 seconds across a persistent connection.

d5 18
a22 21
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.27 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.27
   as compared to 1.3.26.

   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
   A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 1.3.27 addresses and fixes 3 security
   vulnerabilities.

   CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org): A vulnerability exists in all versions of
   Apache prior to 1.3.27 on platforms using System V shared memory based
   scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an attacker who can execute under
   the Apache UID to exploit the Apache shared memory scoreboard format and
   send a signal to any process as root or cause a local denial of service
   attack.  We thank iDefense for their responsible notification and 
   disclosure of this issue.

   CAN-2002-0840 (cve.mitre.org): Apache is susceptible to a cross site
   scripting vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted
   on a domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.  We thank Matthew Murphy for
   the responsible notification and disclosure of this issue.
d24 2
a25 5
   CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org): There were some possible overflows in ab.c
   which could be exploited by a malicious server. Note that this
   vulnerability is not in Apache itself, but rather one of the support
   programs bundled with Apache. We thank David Wagner for the responsible
   notification and disclosure of this issue.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding ownership permissions of System V shared memory based
       scoreboards.  The fix resulted in the new ShmemUIDisUser directive.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0840 (cvs.mitre.org)
       regarding a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the default error
       page when using wildcard DNS.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding some possible overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by
       a malicious server.

a107 6
   The main new features in 1.3.27 (compared to 1.3.26) are:

     * The new ErrorHeader directive has been added.

     * Configuration file globbing can now use simple pattern
       matching.
d109 8
a116 17
     * The protocol version (eg: HTTP/1.1) in the request line parsing
       is now case insensitive.

     * ap_snprintf() can now distinguish between an output which was
       truncated, and an output which exactly filled the buffer.

     * Add ProtocolReqCheck directive, which determines if Apache will
       check for a valid protocol string in the request (eg: HTTP/1.1)
       and return HTTP_BAD_REQUEST if not valid. Versions of Apache
       prior to 1.3.26 would silently ignore bad protocol strings, but
       1.3.26 included a more strict check. This makes it runtime
       configurable.

     * Added support for Berkeley-DB/4.x to mod_auth_db.

     * httpd -V will now also print out the compile time defined
       HARD_SERVER_LIMIT value.
d120 3
a122 3
     * Support Caldera OpenUNIX 8.
     
     * Use SysV semaphores by default on OpenBSD.
d124 2
a125 2
     * Implemented file locking in mod_rewrite for the NetWare
       CLib platform.
d129 5
a133 2
   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.26 (or earlier) and have
   been fixed in Apache 1.3.27:
d135 14
a148 15
     * mod_proxy fixes:
        - The cache in mod_proxy was incorrectly updating the Content-Length
          value from 304 responses when doing validation.
        - Fix a problem in proxy where headers from other modules were
          added to the response headers when this was already done in the
          core already.

     * In 1.3.26, a null or all blank Content-Length field would be
       triggered as an error; previous versions would silently ignore
       this and assume 0.  1.3.27 restores this previous behavior.

     * Win32: Fix one byte buffer overflow in ap_get_win32_interpreter
       when a CGI script's #! line does not contain a \r or \n (i.e.
       a line feed character) in the first 1023 bytes. The overflow
       is always a '\0' (string termination) character.

   particular note is that 1.3.31 addresses and fixes 4 potential
   security issues:
d16 3
a18 20
     o CAN-2003-0987 (cve.mitre.org)
       In mod_digest, verify whether the nonce returned in the client 
       response is one we issued ourselves.  This problem does not affect
       mod_auth_digest.

     o CAN-2003-0020 (cve.mitre.org)
       Escape arbitrary data before writing into the errorlog.

     o CAN-2004-0174 (cve.mitre.org)
       Fix starvation issue on listening sockets where a short-lived
       connection on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a
       child to hold the accept mutex and block out new connections until
       another connection arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket.
       This only affects some platforms, such as Solaris, AIX and
       IRIX. Linux is unaffected.

     o CAN-2003-0993 (cve.mitre.org) 
       Fix parsing of Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a
       netmask; issue is only known to affect big-endian 64-bit
       platforms

     * Linux 2.4+: If Apache is started as root and you code
       CoreDumpDirectory, core dumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.

   New features that relate to all platforms:

     * Add mod_whatkilledus and mod_backtrace (experimental) for
       reporting diagnostic information after a child process crash.

     * Add fatal exception hook for running diagnostic code after a
       crash.  

     * Forensic logging module added (mod_log_forensic)
     
     * '%X' is now accepted as an alias for '%c' in the
       LogFormat directive. This allows you to configure logging
       to still log the connection status even with mod_ssl

a94 9
   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.29 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.31:

     * Fix memory corruption problem with ap_custom_response() function.
       The core per-dir config would later point to request pool data
       that would be reused for different purposes on different requests.

     * mod_usertrack no longer inspects the Cookie2 header for
       the cookie name. It also no longer overwrites other cookies.
d96 9
a104 2
     * Fix bug causing core dump when using CookieTracking without
       specifying a CookieName directly.
d106 2
a107 2
     * UseCanonicalName off was ignoring the client provided
       port information.

                            Apache 1.3.28 Released
d5 21
a25 18
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.28 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.28
   as compared to 1.3.27.

   This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
   particular note is that 1.3.28 addresses and fixes 3 potential
   security issues:

    o CAN-2003-0460 (cve.mitre.org): Fix the rotatelogs support program on
      Win32 and OS/2 to ignore special control characters received over the
      pipe.  Previously such characters could cause it to quit logging and
      exit.  We would like to thank the Hitachi Incident Response team for
      their responsible disclosure of this issue.

    o VU#379828 : The server could crash when going into an infinite loop
      due to too many subsequent internal redirects and nested subrequests.

    o Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child processes, such

  New features
d131 1
a131 1
   The main new features in 1.3.28 (compared to 1.3.27) are:
d133 2
a134 8
     * Added new ap_register_cleanup_ex() API function which allows
       for a "magic" cleanup function to be run at register time
       rather than at cleanup time. 

     * Improvements to mod_usertrack that allows for a regular (verbose)
       as well as "compact" version of the tracking cookie (the new
       'CookieFormat' directive), and the ability to prepend a string
       to the cookie via the 'CookiePrefix' directive.
d138 3
a140 3
     * Introduce Win32 .pdb diagnostic symbols into the Apache 1.3 build
       (as created in Apache 2.0.45 and later.)  which akes debugging and
       analysis of crash dumps and Dr. Watson logs trivial.
d142 2
a143 2
     * AIX: Change the default accept mechanism from pthread back to
       fcntl.
d147 2
a148 5
   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.27 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.28:

     * Make sure the accept mutex is released before calling child exit
       hooks and cleanups.
d150 15
a164 14
     * Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs.  The escaping routines
       now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
       appended if supported by the particular scheme.

     * Prevent obscenely large values of precision in ap_vformatter
       from clobbering a buffer.

     * Update timeout algorithm in free_proc_chain. If a subprocess
       did not exit immediately, the thread would sleep for 3 seconds
       before checking the subprocess exit status again. In a very
       common case when the subprocess was an HTTP server CGI script,
       the CGI script actually exited a fraction of a second into the 3
       second sleep, which effectively limited the server to serving one 
       CGI request every 3 seconds across a persistent connection.

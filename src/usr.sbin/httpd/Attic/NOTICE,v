# NOTICE file for MirOS httpd

This is MirOS httpd, a combined webserver derived from both the ASF's
Apache(TM)/1.3.x series and OpenBSD's src/usr.sbin/httpd, together with
the KAME IPv6 patches and a whole lot of fixes and own inventions.
(m)httpd is being developed as a side project of The MirOS Project, and
not distributed independently. Because httpd is an integral part of
MirOS, it does not have a version number of its own and only reports
"httpd/3.30A" - this will probably not change. (Other parts of OpenBSD
or MirOS, such as bgpd, do not have version numbers of their own either.)

MirOS httpd is a "Derived Work" of the Apache(TM) webserver, and not a
"Contribution", according to the definitions in the preamble of the
Apache(TM) License, 2.0. As such, the MirOS project does not grant patent
licences, and our own changes are subject to the MirOS licence template.
(m)httpd also includes modifications constituting an original work of
authorship by the OpenBSD Project and KAME Project, which are subject to
the Apache(TM) License, 1.1. The ASF, OpenBSD and KAME code are subject
to the respective licences; the MirOS project does not grant any direct
licence to the end user, instead, the original licences are passed on.

Please note that MirOS httpd does not come with a trademark licence for
the ASF's trademarks, and the MirOS Project does not indemnify you against
the ASF for using MirOS httpd.
The Apache(TM) Webserver 1.3.33 documentation is included unmodified,
except for HTML fixes and description of some changes. If the ASF does
not wish for us to redistribute these, please contact us directly.

@More mhttpd, a description and licence, and an advertising clause of mine.
(I promise I'll revoke that advertising clause when it looks like
 it's finally time that all people understood we have to phase them out.)

Also, rename the generated LICENSE.<xxx> file to LICENSE.httpd, and
paginate - instead of concatenate - it from the httpd and mod_ssl
sources and the NOTICE file.

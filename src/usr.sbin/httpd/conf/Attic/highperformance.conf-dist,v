@# Ha, you're reading this config file looking for the easy way out!
# "how do I make my apache server go really really fast??"
# Well you could start by reading the /manual/misc/perf-tuning.html
# page.  But, we'll give you a head start.
#
# This config file is small, it is probably not what you'd expect on a
# full featured internet webserver with multiple users.  But it's
# probably a good starting point for any folks interested in testing
# performance.
#
# To run this config you'll need to use something like:
#     httpd -f @@@@ServerRoot@@@@/conf/highperformance.conf

Port 80
ServerRoot @@@@ServerRoot@@@@
DocumentRoot @@@@ServerRoot@@@@/htdocs
MaxClients 150
StartServers 5
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10
# Assume no memory leaks at all
MaxRequestsPerChild 0

# this is a True Config File
# see http://www.apache.org/info/three-config-files.html
ResourceConfig /dev/null
AccessConfig /dev/null

# it's always nice to know the server has started
ErrorLog logs/error_log

# Some benchmarks require logging, which is a good requirement.  Uncomment
# this if you need logging.
#TransferLog logs/access_log

# Disable symlink protection and htaccess files, they chew far too much.
<Directory />
    AllowOverride none
    Options FollowSymLinks
    # If this was a real internet server you'd probably want to
    # uncomment these:
    #order deny,allow
    #deny from all
</Directory>

# If this was a real internet server you'd probably want to uncomment this:
#<Directory "@@@@ServerRoot@@@@/htdocs">
#    order allow,deny
#    allow from all
#</Directory>

# OK that's enough hints.  Read the documentation if you want more.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

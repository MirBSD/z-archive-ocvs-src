 This is the ssl.key/ directory of Apache/mod_ssl
 where PEM-encoded RSA Private Keys for SSL are stored.

 Per default the following files are provided:

 o server.key:
   This is the server private key for Apache/mod_ssl, configured with the
   SSLCertificateKeyFile directive. Per default this is a dummy file, but may
   be overwritten by the `make certificate' target under built-time.

 o snakeoil.key:
   This is the private key of the _DEMONSTRATION ONLY_ `Snake Oil' Server.  It
   corresponds to the dummy server certificate ../ssl.crt/snakeoil.crt.  NEVER
   USE THIS PRIVATE KEY YOURSELF FOR REAL LIFE! INSTEAD USE A REAL SERVER KEY!

 o snakeoil-ca.key:
   This is the private key of the _DEMONSTRATION ONLY_ `Snake Oil' Certificate
   Authority. It is used to sign the ../ssl.crt/server.crt on `make
   certificate' because self-signed server certificates are not accepted by
   all browsers. NEVER USE THIS PRIVATE KEY YOURSELF FOR REAL LIFE! INSTEAD
   EITHER USE A PUBLICALLY KNOWN CA OR CREATE YOUR OWN CA!

 You can view the ingredients of a particular private key file in plain text
 by running the command (a pass phrase may be queried):

   $ openssl rsa -noout -text -in <name>.key

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

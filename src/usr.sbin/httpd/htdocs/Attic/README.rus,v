@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

@Apache test page, russian translation by Pavel Polischouk <pavelp@@iil.intel.com>
Different russian encodings provided:

 Name		   iconv's codepage

+index.html.dos  - CP-866 aka ibm866; used by DOS and OS/2. 
*index.html.iso  - ISO-8859-5
*index.html.koi  - KOI8-R; used by UNIX flavours and Mac.
 index.html.ucs2 - UCS-2 aka UNICODE aka UNICODEBIG aka UTF-16
 index.html.ucs4 - UCS-4
*index.html.utf8 - UTF-8
*index.html.win  - CP-1251 aka windows-1251 aka MS-CYRILLIC; used by Windows

* - supported by Netscape 4.72. 
+ - Netscape is supposed to support this encoding, but fails to 
read this page on Linux. Should be OK on systems like DOS and OS/2 where this
encoding is the default.
Does anyone need the UCS-2 and UCS-4?@

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

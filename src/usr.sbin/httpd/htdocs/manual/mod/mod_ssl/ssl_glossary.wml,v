<quotation width=300 author="Richard Nixon">
``I know you believe you understand what you think I said, but I am not sure you
realize that what you heard is not what I meant.''
</quotation>

<dl>

<dt><div id="term">Authentication</div>
<dd>The positive identification of a network entity such as a server, a
    client, or a user. In SSL context the server and client
    <em>Certificate</em> verification process.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Access Control</div>
<dd>The restriction of access to network realms. In Apache context
    usually the restriction of access to certain <em>URLs</em>.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Algorithm</div>
<dd>An unambiguous formula or set of rules for solving a problem in a finite
    number of steps. Algorithms for encryption are usually called <em>Ciphers</em>. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Certificate</div>
<dd>A data record used for authenticating network entities such 
    as a server or a client. A certificate contains X.509 information pieces
    about its owner (called the subject) and the signing <em>Certificate
    Authority</em> (called the issuer), plus the owner's public key and the
    signature made by the CA. Network entities verify these signatures using
    CA certificates. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Certification Authority (CA)</div>
<dd>A trusted third party whose purpose is to sign certificates for network
    entities it has authenticated using secure means. Other network entities
    can check the signature to verify that a CA has authenticated the bearer
    of a certificate. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</div>
<dd>An unsigned certificate for submission to a <em>Certification Authority</em>,
    which signs it with the <em>Private Key</em> of their CA <em>Certificate</em>. Once
    the CSR is signed, it becomes a real certificate. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Cipher</div>
<dd>An algorithm or system for data encryption. Examples are DES, IDEA, RC4, etc.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Ciphertext</div>
<dd>The result after a <em>Plaintext</em> passed a <em>Cipher</em>.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Configuration Directive</div>
<dd>A configuration command that controls one or more aspects of a program's
    behavior. In Apache context these are all the command names in the first
    column of the configuration files.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">CONNECT</div>
<dd>A HTTP command for proxying raw data channels over HTTP. It can be used to
    encapsulate other protocols, such as the SSL protocol. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Digital Signature</div>
<dd>An encrypted text block that validates a certificate or other file. A
    <em>Certification Authority</em> creates a signature by generating a
    hash of the <em>Public Key</em> embedded in a <em>Certificate</em>, then
    encrypting the hash with its own <em>Private Key</em>.  Only the CA's
    public key can decrypt the signature, verifying that the CA has
    authenticated the network entity that owns the <em>Certificate</em>. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Export-Crippled</div>
<dd>Diminished in cryptographic strength (and security) in order to comply
    with the United States' Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
    Export-crippled cryptographic software is limited to a small key size,
    resulting in <em>Ciphertext</em> which usually can be decrypted by brute
    force. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Fully-Qualified Domain-Name (FQDN)</div>
<dd>The unique name of a network entity, consisting of a hostname and a domain
    name that can resolve to an IP address. For example, <code>www</code> is a
    hostname, <code>whatever.com</code> is a domain name, and
    <code>www.whatever.com</code> is a fully-qualified domain name. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</div>
<dd>The HyperText Transport Protocol is the standard transmission protocol used
    on the World Wide Web. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">HTTPS</div>
<dd>The HyperText Transport Protocol (Secure), the standard encrypted
    communication mechanism on the World Wide Web. This is actually just HTTP
    over SSL.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Message Digest</div>
<dd>A hash of a message, which can be used to verify that the contents of
    the message have not been altered in transit. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">OpenSSL</div>
<dd>The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS; 
    see <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Pass Phrase</div>
<dd>The word or phrase that protects private key files.
    It prevents unauthorized users from encrypting them.  Usually it's just
    the secret encryption/decryption key used for <em>Ciphers</em>.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Plaintext</div>
<dd>The unencrypted text.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Private Key</div>
<dd>The secret key in a <em>Public Key Cryptography</em> system, used to
    decrypt incoming messages and sign outgoing ones. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Public Key</div>
<dd>The publically available key in a <em>Public Key Cryptography</em> system, used to
    encrypt messages bound for its owner and to decrypt signatures made by its
    owner. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Public Key Cryptography</div>
<dd>The study and application of asymmetric encryption systems, which use one
    key for encryption and another for decryption. A corresponding pair of
    such keys constitutes a key pair. Also called Asymmetric Crypography.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</div>
<dd>A protocol created by Netscape Communications Corporation for
    general communication authentication and encryption over TCP/IP networks.
    The most popular usage is <em>HTTPS</em>, i.e. the HyperText Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP) over SSL.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Session</div>
<dd>The context information of an SSL communication.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">SSLeay</div>
<dd>The original SSL/TLS implementation library developed by 
    Eric A. Young &lt;eay@@aus.rsa.com&gt;;
    see <a href="http://www.ssleay.org/">http://www.ssleay.org/</a>
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Symmetric Cryptography</div>
<dd>The study and application of <em>Ciphers</em> that use a single secret key
    for both encryption and decryption operations. 
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</div>
<dd>The successor protocol to SSL, created by the Internet Engineering Task
    Force (IETF) for general communication authentication and encryption over
    TCP/IP networks. TLS version 1 and is nearly identical with SSL version 3.
<p>
<dt><div id="term">Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</div>
<dd>The formal identifier to locate various resources on the World Wide Web.
    The most popular URL scheme is <code>http</code>. SSL uses the
    scheme <code>https</code>
<p>
<dt><div id="term">X.509</div>
<dd>An authentication certificate scheme recommended by the International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) which is used for SSL/TLS authentication.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

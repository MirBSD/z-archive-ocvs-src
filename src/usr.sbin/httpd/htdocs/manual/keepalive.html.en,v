    <h1 align="CENTER">Apache Keep-Alive Support</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>What is Keep-Alive?</h2>
    The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP, as defined by the
    <code>HTTP/1.1</code> draft, allows persistent connections.
    These long-lived HTTP sessions allow multiple requests to be
    send over the same TCP connection, and in some cases have been
    shown to result in an almost 50% speedup in latency times for
    HTML documents with lots of images.

    <h2>Enabling Keep-Alive Support</h2>
    Apache 1.1 comes with Keep-Alive support on by default, however
    there are some directives you can use to modify Apache's
    behavior:

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Apache 1.2 uses a different syntax
    for the <a href="mod/core.html#keepalive">KeepAlive</a>
    directive.</p>

    <h3>KeepAlive</h3>
    <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Syntax"
    rel="Help"><strong>Syntax:</strong></a> KeepAlive
    <em>max-requests</em><br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Default"
    rel="Help"><strong>Default:</strong></a> <code>KeepAlive
    5</code><br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Context"
    rel="Help"><strong>Context:</strong></a> server config<br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Status"
    rel="Help"><strong>Status:</strong></a> Core

    <p>This directive enables Keep-Alive support. Set
    <em>max-requests</em> to the maximum number of requests you
    want Apache to entertain per connection. A limit is imposed to
    prevent a client from hogging your server resources. Set this
    to <code>0</code> to disable support.</p>

    <h3>KeepAliveTimeout</h3>
    <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Syntax"
    rel="Help"><strong>Syntax:</strong></a> KeepAliveTimeout
    <em>seconds</em><br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Default"
    rel="Help"><strong>Default:</strong></a> <code>KeepAliveTimeout
    15</code><br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Context"
    rel="Help"><strong>Context:</strong></a> server config<br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Status"
    rel="Help"><strong>Status:</strong></a> Core

    <p>The number of seconds Apache will wait for a subsequent
    request before closing the connection. Once a request has been
    received, the timeout value specified by the <a
    href="mod/core.html#timeout"><code>Timeout</code></a> directive
    applies.</p>

    <h2>When Keep-Alive Is Used</h2>
    In order for Keep-Alive support to be used, first the browser
    must support it. Many current browsers, including Netscape
    Navigator 2.0, and Spyglass Mosaic-based browsers (including
    Microsoft Internet Explorer) do. Note, however, that some
    Windows 95-based browsers misbehave with Keep-Alive-supporting
    servers; they may occasionally hang on a connect. This has been
    observed with several Windows browsers, and occurs when
    connecting to any Keep-Alive server, not just Apache. Netscape
    3.0b5 and later versions are known to work around this problem.


    <p>However, Keep-Alive support only is active with files where
    the length is known beforehand. This means that most CGI
    scripts, server-side included files and directory listings will
    not use the Keep-Alive protocol. While this should be
    completely transparent to the end user, it is something the
    web-master may want to keep in mind.</p>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

</pre>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>COMPILING THE SUEXEC
    WRAPPER</strong><br />
     You now need to compile the suEXEC wrapper. At the shell
    command prompt, after compiling Apache,
    type:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>make
    suexec[ENTER]</code></strong>. This should create the
    <strong><em>suexec</em></strong> wrapper executable.</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>COMPILING APACHE FOR USE WITH
    SUEXEC</strong><br />
     By default, Apache is compiled to look for the suEXEC wrapper
    in the following location.</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><em>From src/include/httpd.h</em></p>
<pre>
     /* The path to the suExec wrapper, can be overridden in Configuration */
     #ifndef SUEXEC_BIN
     #define SUEXEC_BIN  HTTPD_ROOT "/sbin/suexec"
     #endif
</pre>

    <p align="LEFT">If your installation requires location of the
    wrapper program in a different directory, either add
    <code>-DSUEXEC_BIN=\"<em>&lt;/your/path/to/suexec&gt;</em>\"</code>
    to your CFLAGS (or edit src/include/httpd.h) and recompile your
    Apache server. See <a href="install.html">Compiling and
    Installing Apache</a> (and the <samp>INSTALL</samp> file in the
    source distribution) for more info on this process.</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong>COPYING THE SUEXEC BINARY TO ITS PROPER
    LOCATION</strong><br />
     Copy the <strong><em>suexec</em></strong> executable created
    in the exercise above to the defined location for
    <strong>SUEXEC_BIN</strong>.</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong><code>cp suexec
    /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec [ENTER]</code></strong></p>

    <p align="LEFT">In order for the wrapper to set the user ID, it
    must be installed as owner <strong><em>root</em></strong> and
    must have the setuserid execution bit set for file modes. If
    you are not running a <strong><em>root</em></strong> user
    shell, do so now and execute the following commands.</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><strong><code>chown root
    /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec [ENTER]</code></strong><br />
     <strong><code>chmod 4711 /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec
    [ENTER]</code></strong></p>

    <h3><a id="enable" name="enable">Enabling &amp; Disabling
    suEXEC</a></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">After properly installing the
    <strong>suexec</strong> wrapper executable, you must kill and
    restart the Apache server. A simple <strong><code>kill -1 `cat
    httpd.pid`</code></strong> will not be enough. Upon startup of
    the web-server, if Apache finds a properly configured
    <strong>suexec</strong> wrapper, it will print the following
    message to the console (Apache 1.2):</p>
<pre>
    Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper.
</pre>
    If you use Apache 1.3 the following message is printed to the
    error log:
<pre>
    [notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: <em>/path/to/suexec</em>)
</pre>

    <p align="LEFT">If you don't see this message at server
    startup, the server is most likely not finding the wrapper
    program where it expects it, or the executable is not installed
    <strong><em>setuid root</em></strong>. Check your installation
    and try again.</p>

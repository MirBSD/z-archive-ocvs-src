    <h2><a id="redirect" name="redirect">How to redirect an entire
    server or directory to a single URL</a></h2>

    <p>There are two chief ways to redirect all requests for an
    entire server to a single location: one which requires the use
    of <code>mod_rewrite</code>, and another which uses a CGI
    script.</p>

    <p>First: if all you need to do is migrate a server from one
    name to another, simply use the <code>Redirect</code>
    directive, as supplied by <code>mod_alias</code>:</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
  Redirect / http://www.apache.org/
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Since <code>Redirect</code> will forward along the complete
    path, however, it may not be appropriate - for example, when
    the directory structure has changed after the move, and you
    simply want to direct people to the home page.</p>

    <p>The best option is to use the standard Apache module
    <code>mod_rewrite</code>. If that module is compiled in, the
    following lines</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule /.* http://www.apache.org/ [R]
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    will send an HTTP 302 Redirect back to the client, and no
    matter what they gave in the original URL, they'll be sent to
    "http://www.apache.org/".

    <p>The second option is to set up a <code>ScriptAlias</code>
    pointing to a <strong>CGI script</strong> which outputs a 301
    or 302 status and the location of the other server.</p>

    <p>By using a <strong>CGI script</strong> you can intercept
    various requests and treat them specially, <em>e.g.</em>, you
    might want to intercept <strong>POST</strong> requests, so that
    the client isn't redirected to a script on the other server
    which expects POST information (a redirect will lose the POST
    information.) You might also want to use a CGI script if you
    don't want to compile mod_rewrite into your server.</p>

    <p>Here's how to redirect all requests to a script... In the
    server configuration file,</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
ScriptAlias / /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/redirect_script/
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    and here's a simple perl script to redirect requests:

    <blockquote>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

print "Status: 302 Moved Temporarily\r\n" .
      "Location: http://www.some.where.else.com/\r\n" .
      "\r\n";

</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h2><a id="logreset" name="logreset">How to reset your log
    files</a></h2>

    <p>Sooner or later, you'll want to reset your log files
    (access_log and error_log) because they are too big, or full of
    old information you don't need.</p>

    <p><code>access.log</code> typically grows by 1Mb for each
    10,000 requests.</p>

    <p>Most people's first attempt at replacing the logfile is to
    just move the logfile or remove the logfile. This doesn't
    work.</p>

    <p>Apache will continue writing to the logfile at the same
    offset as before the logfile moved. This results in a new
    logfile being created which is just as big as the old one, but
    it now contains thousands (or millions) of null characters.</p>

    <p>The correct procedure is to move the logfile, then signal
    Apache to tell it to reopen the logfiles.</p>

    <p>Apache is signaled using the <strong>SIGHUP</strong> (-1)
    signal. <em>e.g.</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>mv access_log access_log.old<br />
       kill -1 `cat httpd.pid`</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Note: <code>httpd.pid</code> is a file containing the
    <strong>p</strong>rocess <strong>id</strong> of the Apache
    httpd daemon, Apache saves this in the same directory as the
    log files.</p>

    <p>Many people use this method to replace (and backup) their
    logfiles on a nightly or weekly basis.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2><a id="stoprob" name="stoprob">How to stop or restrict
    robots</a></h2>

    <p>Ever wondered why so many clients are interested in a file
    called <code>robots.txt</code> which you don't have, and never
    did have?</p>

    <p>These clients are called <strong>robots</strong> (also known
    as crawlers, spiders and other cute names) - special automated
    clients which wander around the web looking for interesting
    resources.</p>

    <p>Most robots are used to generate some kind of <em>web
    index</em> which is then used by a <em>search engine</em> to
    help locate information.</p>

    <p><code>robots.txt</code> provides a means to request that
    robots limit their activities at the site, or more often than
    not, to leave the site alone.</p>

    <p>When the first robots were developed, they had a bad
    reputation for sending hundreds/thousands of requests to each
    site, often resulting in the site being overloaded. Things have
    improved dramatically since then, thanks to <a
    href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/guidelines.html">
    Guidelines for Robot Writers</a>, but even so, some robots may
    exhibit unfriendly behavior which the webmaster isn't willing
    to tolerate, and will want to stop.</p>

    <p>Another reason some webmasters want to block access to
    robots, is to stop them indexing dynamic information. Many
    search engines will use the data collected from your pages for
    months to come - not much use if you're serving stock quotes,
    news, weather reports or anything else that will be stale by
    the time people find it in a search engine.</p>

    <p>If you decide to exclude robots completely, or just limit
    the areas in which they can roam, create a
    <code>robots.txt</code> file; refer to the <a
    href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html">
    robot information pages</a> provided by Martijn Koster for the
    syntax.</p>

    <h2><a id="proxyssl" name="proxyssl">How to proxy SSL requests
    <em>through</em> your non-SSL Apache server</a><br />
     <small>(<em>submitted by David Sedlock</em>)</small></h2>

    <p>SSL uses port 443 for requests for secure pages. If your
    browser just sits there for a long time when you attempt to
    access a secure page over your Apache proxy, then the proxy may
    not be configured to handle SSL. You need to instruct Apache to
    listen on port 443 in addition to any of the ports on which it
    is already listening:</p>
<pre>
    Listen 80
    Listen 443
</pre>

    <p>Then set the security proxy in your browser to 443. That
    might be it!</p>

    <p>If your proxy is sending requests to another proxy, then you
    may have to set the directive ProxyRemote differently. Here are
    my settings:</p>
<pre>
    ProxyRemote http://nicklas:80/ http://proxy.mayn.franken.de:8080
    ProxyRemote http://nicklas:443/ http://proxy.mayn.franken.de:443
</pre>

    <p>Requests on port 80 of my proxy <samp>nicklas</samp> are
    forwarded to <samp>proxy.mayn.franken.de:8080</samp>, while
    requests on port 443 are forwarded to
    <samp>proxy.mayn.franken.de:443</samp>. If the remote proxy is
    not set up to handle port 443, then the last directive can be
    left out. SSL requests will only go over the first proxy.</p>

    <p>Note that your Apache does NOT have to be set up to serve
    secure pages with SSL. Proxying SSL is a different thing from
    using it.</p>

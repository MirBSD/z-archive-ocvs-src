      <h3>Apache HTTP Server Version 1.3</h3>
    </div>


    <h1 align="CENTER">Why We Took PEM Out of Apache</h1>
    On May 17th, 1995, we were asked by a representative of NCSA to
    remove any copies of NCSA httpd prior to 1.4.1 from our web
    site. They were mandated by the NSA to inform us that
    redistribution of pre-1.4.1 code violated the same laws that
    make distributing Phill Zimmerman's PGP package to other
    countries illegal. There was <strong>no</strong> encryption in
    NCSA's httpd, only hooks to publicly available libraries of PEM
    code. By the NSA's rules, even hooks to this type of
    application is illegal.

    <p>Because Apache is based on NCSA code, and we had basically
    not touched that part of the software, we were informed that
    Apache was also illegal to distribute to foreign countries, and
    advised (not mandated) by NCSA to remove it. So, we removed
    both the copies of the NCSA httpd we had, and all versions of
    Apache previous to 0.6.5.</p>

    <p>The Apache members are strong advocates of the right to
    digital privacy, so the decision to submit to the NSA and
    remove the code was not an easy one. Here are some elements in
    our rationale:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The PEM code in httpd was not widely used. No major site
      relied upon its use, so its loss is not a blow to encryption
      and security on the world wide web. There are other efforts
      designed to give much more flexible security - SSL and SHTTP
      - so this wasn't a function whose absence would really be
      missed on a functional level.</li>

      <li>We didn't feel like being just a couple more martyrs in a
      fight being fought very well by many other people. Rather
      than have the machine that supports the project confiscated
      or relocated to South Africa, <em>etc.</em>, we think there
      are more efficient methods to address the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    It kind of sickens us that we had to do it, but so be it.

    <p>Patches that re-implement the PEM code may be available at a
    foreign site soon. If it does show up, we'll point to it - that
    can't be illegal!</p>

    <p>Finally, here is a compendium of pointers to sites related
    to encryption and export law. We can't promise this list will
    be up to date, so send us mail when you see a problem or want a
    link added. Thanks.</p>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

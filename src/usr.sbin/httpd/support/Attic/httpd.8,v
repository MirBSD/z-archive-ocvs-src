@* merge OpenBSD 3.5-current
* re-sort entries in Makefile
  => not a bunch of adds any more; all alphabetic
  => remove obsolete SUBDIRS_ONLY_BSD for now
     (MirLinux won't come that soon due to a certain lawsuit,
      licence issues with unwillingly GNU fanatics, and my
      chronic unwillingness to do masochistic work)
* spacing, RCS IDs, etc.
* pkg gets folded into pkg_install, so we only have one dir
  to worry about
* pkg_add leaves the tree - nobody cared about this kind
  of package tools anyways, and they're not part of MirBSD
  (although still supported by MirPorts)
* mopd leaves - we don't have VAX support anyways

.SH NAME
httpd \- Apache hypertext transfer protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B httpd 
[
.B \-hlvX?
] [
.BI \-d " serverroot"
] [
.BI \-f " config"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B httpd
is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It is
designed to be run as a standalone daemon process. When used like this
is will create a pool of child processes to handle requests. To stop
it, send a TERM signal to the initial (parent) process. The PID of
this process is written to a file as given in the configuration file.
Alternatively 
.B httpd 
may be invoked by the Internet daemon inetd(8) each
time a connection to the HTTP service is made.
.PP
This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
of the directives necessary to configure httpd see the Apache manual,
which is part of the Apache distribution or can be found at
http://www.apache.org/. Paths in this manual may not reflect those
compiled into httpd.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.BI \-d " serverroot"
Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to \fIserverroot\fP. This
can be overridden by the ServerRoot command in the configuration file. The
default is \fB/usr/local/etc/httpd\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f " config"
Execute the commands in the file \fIconfig\fP on startup. If \fIconfig\fP
does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to
the ServerRoot. The default is \fBconf/httpd.conf\fP.
.TP
.B \-h
Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and
places where the directive is valid.
.TP
.B \-l
Output a list of modules compiled into the server.
.TP
.B \-X
Run in single-process mode, for internal debugging purposes only; the daemon
does not detach from the terminal or fork any children. Do NOT use this mode
to provide ordinary web service.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version of httpd, and then exit.
.TP
.B \-?
Print a list of the httpd options, and then exit.

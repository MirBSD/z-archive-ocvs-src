@=== PURPOSE ===

This file documents the changes made by the Apache Group to James
Clark's Expat parser. The original Expat distribution can be found at
http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html.


=== SUBSET INFORMATION ===

Apache does not choose (or need) to use the entire Expat parser
distribution. The subset that Apache will use will be referred to as
"expat-lite". In particular, this directory contains the files from
the following Expat distribution subdirectories:

  expat/xmltok/*
  expat/xmlparse/*

We also retain expat/expat.html for attribution to James Clark and
licensing information.

Note that Apache has replaced (with custom versions) the .dsp files
normally distributed with Expat. Other changes are detailed further
below.


=== FILES ADDED ===

This file (CHANGES) has been added to document changes from the
original Expat distribution.

Makefile.tmpl has been created from scratch to provide build
instructions to the Apache build system.

xmlparse.def and xmltok.def have been added.

.cvsignore has been added.


=== CHANGES TO ORIGINAL ===

The files, in their original state from the Expat distribution, have
been tagged within CVS with the "EXPAT_1_1" tag. That tag may be used
as a reference for changes made by the Apache Group.

The following changes have been made:

June, 1999:

  - modified xmldef.h to define XML_BYTE_ORDER in terms of the
    AP_BYTE_ORDER symbol.
  - removed compilation warnings from: xmlparse.c, xmltok.c, xmltok.h, 
    xmltok_impl.c, xmltok_ns.c

November, 1999:

  - xmlparse.{def,dsp,mak} and xmltok.{def,dsp,mak} were added.
    NOTE: the .dsp files are different from the standard Expat
	  distribution.
  - dllmain.c (from the Expat distribution) was added

January, 2000:

  - Renamed lookup() in hashtable.[ch] to hashTableLookup() to prevent
    possible conflicts with third-party libraries and modules. Updated
    calls in xmlparse.c accordingly.

This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@README for Apache 1.2 Example Module
[April, 1997]

The files in the src/modules/example directory under the Apache
distribution directory tree are provided as an example to those that
wish to write modules that use the Apache API.

The main file is mod_example.c, which illustrates all the different
callback mechanisms and call syntaces.  By no means does an add-on
module need to include routines for all of the callbacks - quite the
contrary!

The example module is an actual working module.  If you link it into
your server, enable the "example-handler" handler for a location, and then
browse to that location, you will see a display of some of the tracing
the example module did as the various callbacks were made.

To include the example module in your server, follow the steps below:

    1. Uncomment the "Module example_module" line near the bottom of
       the src/Configuration file.  If there isn't one, add it; it
       should look like this:

       Module example_module        modules/example/mod_example.o

    2. Run the src/Configure script ("cd src; ./Configure").  This will
       build the Makefile for the server itself, and update the
       src/modules/Makefile for any additional modules you have
       requested from beneath that subdirectory.

    3. Make the server (run "make" in the src directory).

To add another module of your own:

    A. mkdir src/modules/mymodule
    B. cp src/modules/example/* src/modules/mymodule
    C. Modify the files in the new directory
    D. Follow steps [1] through [3] above, with appropriate changes.

To activate the example module, include a block similar to the
following in your srm.conf file:

    <Location /example-info>
	SetHandler example-handler
    </Location>

As an alternative, you can put the following into a .htaccess file and
then request the file "test.example" from that location:

    AddHandler example-handler .example

After reloading/restarting your server, you should be able to browse
to this location and see the brief display mentioned earlier.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

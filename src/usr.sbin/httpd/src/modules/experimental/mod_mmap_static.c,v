 * mod_mmap_static: mmap a config-time list of files for faster serving
 *
 * v0.04
 *
 * Author: Dean Gaudet <dgaudet@@arctic.org>
 *
 * v0.01: initial implementation
 * v0.02: get rid of the extra stat() in the core by filling in what we know
 * v0.03: get rid of the cached match from the xlat routine since there are
 *        many cases where the request is modified between it and the
 *        handler... so we do the binary search twice, but the second time
 *        we can use st_ino and st_dev to speed it up.
 * v0.04: work around mod_rewrite, which sets r->filename to the uri first
 */

/*
    Documentation:

    The concept is simple.  Some sites have a set of static files that are
    really busy, and change infrequently (or even on a regular schedule).
    Save time by mmap()ing these files into memory and avoid a lot of the
    crap required to do normal file serving.  Place directives such as:

	mmapfile /path/to/file1
	mmapfile /path/to/file2
	...

    into your configuration.  These files are only mmap()d when the server
    is restarted, so if you change the list, or if the files are changed,
    then you'll need to restart the server.

    To reiterate that point:  if the files are modified *in place*
    without restarting the server you may end up serving requests that
    are completely bogus.  You should update files by unlinking the old
    copy and putting a new copy in place.  Most tools such as rdist and
    mv do this.

    There's no such thing as inheriting these files across vhosts or
    whatever... place the directives in the main server only.

    Known problems:

    Don't use Alias or RewriteRule to move these files around...  unless
    you feel like paying for an extra stat() on each request.  This is
    a deficiency in the Apache API that will hopefully be solved some day.
    The file will be served out of the mmap cache, but there will be
    an extra stat() that's a waste.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

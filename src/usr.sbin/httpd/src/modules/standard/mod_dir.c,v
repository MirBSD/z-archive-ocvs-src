@fix something that has been bothering me:
we disallow "http://localhost/foo" when foo is
a directory (http://localhost/foo/ is correct),
but
 * only on MirBSD
 * the automatically generated directory index
   was broken (i.e. sent you to the former)

Now, the MirBSD behaviour is a compile-time option
(enabled by default), and the directory index is so
that BOTH the hRef AND the link text itself are
postfixed with a trailing slash.

This is an incompatible change to the directory listing
output, however it's so configurable anyways (non-fancy
indexing vs fancy, which has many options) that I could
not care less.

@On __MirBSD__ mimic DJB publicfile behaviour to _not_ add
an extra slash ('/') at the end of request URIs when the
"file" found is a directory.
Rationale: lower request traffic. People should know that
a directory is no file, and that
 http://foo.com/bar
does not equal
 http://foo.com/bar/index.htm
and vice versa.

Use mod_rewrite if you want to "mask" the real request
targets, reverse (from IRC) has a pretty good hint for that.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

# Extra rule sets for making shared module DLLs for Cygwin 1.x
# 
# On Cygwin OS the user needs to run twice "make" if shared modules have 
# been requested using the --enable-shared=<module> configure flag.
# This is because when we pass the module mod_foo.c we have no import 
# library, usually src/libhttpd.dll to link against in this case. So the
# two "make" runs do the following:
#
#   1st run: builds all static modules and links everything to the 
#            shared core DLL, which is also the import library for any
#            further shared modules, including the apxs tool mechanism.
#
#   2nd run: builds *only* the shared module DLLs specified by the 
#            --enable-shared configure switch and of course updates
#            the buildmark.o and hence httpd's build date.
#
# Any suggestions in getting this done in one step are highly welcome.
# Stipe Tolj <tolj@@wapme-systems.de>
#

# overwrite variables that are defined in previous makefile

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

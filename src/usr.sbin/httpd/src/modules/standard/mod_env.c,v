 * mod_env.c
 * version 0.0.5
 * status beta
 * Pass environment variables to CGI/SSI scripts.
 *
 * Andrew Wilson <Andrew.Wilson@@cm.cf.ac.uk> 06.Dec.95
 *
 * Change log:
 * 08.Dec.95 Now allows PassEnv directive to appear more than once in
 *           conf files.
 * 10.Dec.95 optimisation.  getenv() only called at startup and used
 *           to build a fast-to-access table.  table used to build
 *           per-server environment for each request.
 *           robustness.  better able to handle errors in configuration
 *           files:
 *           1)  PassEnv directive present, but no environment variable listed
 *           2)  PassEnv FOO present, but $FOO not present in environment
 *           3)  no PassEnv directive present
 * 23.Dec.95 Now allows SetEnv directive with same semantics as 'sh' setenv:
 *              SetEnv Var      sets Var to the empty string
 *              SetEnv Var Val  sets Var to the value Val
 *           Values containing whitespace should be quoted, eg:
 *              SetEnv Var "this is some text"
 *           Environment variables take their value from the last instance
 *           of PassEnv / SetEnv to be reached in the configuration file.
 *           For example, the sequence:
 *              PassEnv FOO
 *              SetEnv FOO override
 *           Causes FOO to take the value 'override'.
 * 23.Feb.96 Added UnsetEnv directive to allow environment variables
 *           to be removed.
 *           Virtual hosts now 'inherit' parent server environment which
 *           they're able to overwrite with their own directives or
 *           selectively ignore with UnsetEnv.
 *       *** IMPORTANT - the way that virtual hosts inherit their ***
 *       *** environment variables from the default server's      ***
 *       *** configuration has changed.  You should test your     ***
 *       *** configuration carefully before accepting this        ***
 *       *** version of the module in a live webserver which used ***
 *       *** older versions of the module.                        ***

 * mod_headers.c: Add/append/remove HTTP response headers
 *     Written by Paul Sutton, paul@@ukweb.com, 1 Oct 1996
 *
 * New directive, Header, can be used to add/replace/remove HTTP headers.
 * Valid in both per-server and per-dir configurations.
 *
 * Syntax is:
 *
 *   Header action header value
 *
 * Where action is one of:
 *     set    - set this header, replacing any old value
 *     add    - add this header, possible resulting in two or more
 *              headers with the same name
 *     append - append this text onto any existing header of this same
 *     unset  - remove this header
 *
 * Where action is unset, the third argument (value) should not be given.
 * The header name can include the colon, or not.
 *
 * The Header directive can only be used where allowed by the FileInfo
 * override.
 *
 * When the request is processed, the header directives are processed in
 * this order: firstly, the main server, then the virtual server handling
 * this request (if any), then any <Directory> sections (working downwards
 * from the root dir), then an <Location> sections (working down from
 * shortest URL component), the any <File> sections. This order is
 * important if any 'set' or 'unset' actions are used. For example,
 * the following two directives have different effect if applied in
 * the reverse order:
 *
 *   Header append Author "John P. Doe"
 *   Header unset Author
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *  To set the "Author" header, use
 *     Header add Author "John P. Doe"
 *
 *  To remove a header:
 *     Header unset Author
 *

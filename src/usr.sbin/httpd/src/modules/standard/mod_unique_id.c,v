/* Comments:
 *
 * We want an identifier which is unique across all hits, everywhere.
 * "everywhere" includes multiple httpd instances on the same machine, or on
 * multiple machines.  Essentially "everywhere" should include all possible
 * httpds across all servers at a particular "site".  We make some assumptions
 * that if the site has a cluster of machines then their time is relatively
 * synchronized.  We also assume that the first address returned by a
 * gethostbyname (gethostname()) is unique across all the machines at the
 * "site".
 *
 * We also further assume that pids fit in 32-bits.  If something uses more
 * than 32-bits, the fix is trivial, but it requires the unrolled uuencoding
 * loop to be extended.
 *
 * Together, the in_addr and pid are assumed to absolutely uniquely identify
 * this one child from all other currently running children on all servers
 * (including this physical server if it is running multiple httpds) from each
 * other.
 *
 * The stamp and counter are used to distinguish all hits for a particular
 * (in_addr,pid) pair.  The stamp is updated using r->request_time,
 * saving cpu cycles.  The counter is never reset, and is used to permit up to
 * 64k requests in a single second by a single child.
 *
 * The 112-bits of unique_id_rec are encoded using the alphabet
 * [A-Za-z0-9@@-], resulting in 19 bytes of printable characters.  That is then
 * stuffed into the environment variable UNIQUE_ID so that it is available to
 * other modules.  The alphabet choice differs from normal base64 encoding
 * [A-Za-z0-9+/] because + and / are special characters in URLs and we want to
 * make it easy to use UNIQUE_ID in URLs.
 *
 * Note that UNIQUE_ID should be considered an opaque token by other
 * applications.  No attempt should be made to dissect its internal components.
 * It is an abstraction that may change in the future as the needs of this
 * module change.
 *
 * It is highly desirable that identifiers exist for "eternity".  But future
 * needs (such as much faster webservers, moving to 64-bit pids, or moving to a
 * multithreaded server) may dictate a need to change the contents of
 * unique_id_rec.  Such a future implementation should ensure that the first
 * field is still a time_t stamp.  By doing that, it is possible for a site to
 * have a "flag second" in which they stop all of their old-format servers,
 * wait one entire second, and then start all of their new-servers.  This
 * procedure will ensure that the new space of identifiers is completely unique
 * from the old space.  (Since the first four unencoded bytes always differ.)

 * Sun Jun  7 05:43:49 CEST 1998 -- Alvaro
 * More comments:
 * 1) The UUencoding prodecure is now done in a general way, avoiding
 * the problems with sizes and paddings that can arise depending on
 * the architecture. Now the offsets and sizes of the elements of the
 * unique_id_rec structure are calculated in unique_id_global_init;
 * and then used to duplicate the structure without the paddings that
 * might exist. The multithreaded server fix should be now very easy:
 * just add a new "tid" field to the unique_id_rec structure, and
 * increase by one UNIQUE_ID_REC_MAX.
 * 2) unique_id_rec.stamp has been changed from "time_t" to
 * "unsigned int", because its size is 64bits on some platforms
 * (linux/alpha), and this caused problems with htonl/ntohl. Well,
 * this shouldn't be a problem till year 2106.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

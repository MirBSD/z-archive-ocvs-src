 * mod_actions.c: executes scripts based on MIME type or HTTP method
 *
 * by Alexei Kosut; based on mod_cgi.c, mod_mime.c and mod_includes.c,
 * adapted by rst from original NCSA code by Rob McCool
 *
 * Usage instructions:
 *
 * Action mime/type /cgi-bin/script
 *
 * will activate /cgi-bin/script when a file of content type mime/type is
 * requested. It sends the URL and file path of the requested document using
 * the standard CGI PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED environment variables.
 *
 * Script PUT /cgi-bin/script
 *
 * will activate /cgi-bin/script when a request is received with the
 * HTTP method "PUT".  The available method names are defined in httpd.h.
 * If the method is GET, the script will only be activated if the requested
 * URI includes query information (stuff after a ?-mark).

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

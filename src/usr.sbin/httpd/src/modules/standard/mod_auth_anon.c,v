 * http_auth: authentication

 * Rob McCool & Brian Behlendorf.
 *
 * Adapted to Apache by rst.
 *
 * Version 0.5 May 1996
 *
 * Modified by Dirk.vanGulik@@jrc.it to
 *
 * Adapted to allow anonymous logins, just like with Anon-FTP, when
 * one gives the magic user name 'anonymous' and ones email address
 * as the password.
 *
 * Just add the following tokes to your <directory> setup:
 *
 * Anonymous                    magic-user-id [magic-user-id]...
 *
 * Anonymous_MustGiveEmail      [ on | off ] default = on
 * Anonymous_LogEmail           [ on | off ] default = on
 * Anonymous_VerifyEmail        [ on | off ] default = off
 * Anonymous_NoUserId           [ on | off ] default = off
 * Anonymous_Authoritative      [ on | off ] default = off
 *
 * The magic user id is something like 'anonymous', it is NOT case sensitive.
 *
 * The MustGiveEmail flag can be used to force users to enter something
 * in the password field (like an email address). Default is on.
 *
 * Furthermore the 'NoUserID' flag can be set to allow completely empty
 * usernames in as well; this can be is convenient as a single return
 * in broken GUIs like W95 is often given by the user. The Default is off.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

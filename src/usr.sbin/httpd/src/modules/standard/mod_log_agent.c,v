@Merge import of OpenBSD source, ports and XF4 tree.

While here,
o clean up differences where possible
o whitespace cleanup
o ifdef ./. if defined()
o '...' ./. "..."
o echo foo > bar ./. echo foo >bar
o `...` ./. $(...) ./. $$(...)
o `...' ./. '...'
o modernize "our" tree, e.g. WWW in ports
o fix some typos and brainos introduced when renaming OpenBSD to MirBSD
o use hardware 80387 by default
o migrate Apache 1.3.28 OpenBSD ./. MirBSD ./. KAME
o work around as many CVS bugs as possible (add back/delete files, ...)

Synchronize stuff, ready for ongoing changes.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

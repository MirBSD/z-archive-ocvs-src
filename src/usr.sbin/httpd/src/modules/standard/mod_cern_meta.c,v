 * mod_cern_meta.c
 * version 0.1.0
 * status beta
 *
 * Andrew Wilson <Andrew.Wilson@@cm.cf.ac.uk> 25.Jan.96
 *
 * *** IMPORTANT ***
 * This version of mod_cern_meta.c controls Meta File behaviour on a
 * per-directory basis.  Previous versions of the module defined behaviour
 * on a per-server basis.  The upshot is that you'll need to revisit your
 * configuration files in order to make use of the new module.
 * ***
 *
 * Emulate the CERN HTTPD Meta file semantics.  Meta files are HTTP
 * headers that can be output in addition to the normal range of
 * headers for each file accessed.  They appear rather like the Apache
 * .asis files, and are able to provide a crude way of influencing
 * the Expires: header, as well as providing other curiosities.
 * There are many ways to manage meta information, this one was
 * chosen because there is already a large number of CERN users
 * who can exploit this module.  It should be noted that there are probably
 * more sensitive ways of managing the Expires: header specifically.
 *
 * The module obeys the following directives, which can appear
 * in the server's .conf files and in .htaccess files.
 *
 *  MetaFiles <on|off>
 *
 *    turns on|off meta file processing for any directory.
 *    Default value is off
 *
 *        # turn on MetaFiles in this directory
 *        MetaFiles on
 *
 *  MetaDir <directory name>
 *
 *    specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find
 *    meta information files.  The directory is usually a 'hidden'
 *    subdirectory of the directory that contains the file being
 *    accessed.  eg:
 *
 *        # .meta files are in the *same* directory as the
 *        # file being accessed
 *        MetaDir .
 *
 *    the default is to look in a '.web' subdirectory. This is the
 *    same as for CERN 3.+ webservers and behaviour is the same as
 *    for the directive:
 *
 *        MetaDir .web
 *
 *  MetaSuffix <meta file suffix>
 *
 *    specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the
 *    meta information.  eg:
 *
 *       # our meta files are suffixed with '.cern_meta'
 *       MetaSuffix .cern_meta
 *
 *    the default is to look for files with the suffix '.meta'.  This
 *    behaviour is the same as for the directive:
 *
 *       MetaSuffix .meta
 *
 * When accessing the file
 *
 *   DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/index.html
 *
 * this module will look for the file
 *
 *   DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/.web/index.html.meta
 *
 * and will use its contents to generate additional MIME header
 * information.
 *
 * For more information on the CERN Meta file semantics see:
 *
 *   http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Config/General.html#MetaDir
 *
 * Change-log:
 * 29.Jan.96 pfopen/pfclose instead of fopen/fclose
 *           DECLINE when real file not found, we may be checking each
 *           of the index.html/index.shtml/index.htm variants and don't
 *           need to report missing ones as spurious errors.
 * 31.Jan.96 log_error reports about a malformed .meta file, rather
 *           than a script error.
 * 20.Jun.96 MetaFiles <on|off> default off, added, so that module
 *           can be configured per-directory.  Prior to this the module
 *           was running for each request anywhere on the server, naughty..
 * 29.Jun.96 All directives made per-directory.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/* mod_speling.c - by Alexei Kosut <akosut@@organic.com> June, 1996
 *
 * This module is transparent, and simple. It attempts to correct
 * misspellings of URLs that users might have entered, namely by checking
 * capitalizations. If it finds a match, it sends a redirect.
 *
 * 08-Aug-1997 <Martin.Kraemer@@Mch.SNI.De>
 * o Upgraded module interface to apache_1.3a2-dev API (more NULL's in
 *   speling_module).
 * o Integrated tcsh's "spelling correction" routine which allows one
 *   misspelling (character insertion/omission/typo/transposition).
 *   Rewrote it to ignore case as well. This ought to catch the majority
 *   of misspelled requests.
 * o Commented out the second pass where files' suffixes are stripped.
 *   Given the better hit rate of the first pass, this rather ugly
 *   (request index.html, receive index.db ?!?!) solution can be
 *   omitted.
 * o wrote a "kind of" html page for mod_speling
 *
 * Activate it with "CheckSpelling On"

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,

# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

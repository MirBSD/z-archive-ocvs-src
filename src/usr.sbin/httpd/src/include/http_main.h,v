/*
 * Routines in http_main.c which other code --- in particular modules ---
 * may want to call.  Right now, that's limited to timeout handling.
 * There are two functions which modules can call to trigger a timeout
 * (with the per-virtual-server timeout duration); these are hard_timeout
 * and soft_timeout.
 *
 * The difference between the two is what happens when the timeout
 * expires (or earlier than that, if the client connection aborts) ---
 * a soft_timeout just puts the connection to the client in an
 * "aborted" state, which will cause http_protocol.c to stop trying to
 * talk to the client, but otherwise allows the code to continue normally.
 * hard_timeout(), by contrast, logs the request, and then aborts it
 * completely --- longjmp()ing out to the accept() loop in http_main.
 * Any resources tied into the request's resource pool will be cleaned up;
 * everything that isn't will leak.
 *
 * soft_timeout() is recommended as a general rule, because it gives your
 * code a chance to clean up.  However, hard_timeout() may be the most
 * convenient way of dealing with timeouts waiting for some external
 * resource other than the client, if you can live with the restrictions.
 *
 * (When a hard timeout is in scope, critical sections can be guarded
 * with block_alarms() and unblock_alarms() --- these are declared in
 * alloc.c because they are most often used in conjunction with
 * routines to allocate something or other, to make sure that the
 * cleanup does get registered before any alarm is allowed to happen
 * which might require it to be cleaned up; they * are, however,
 * implemented in http_main.c).
 *
 * NOTE!  It's not "fair" for a hard_timeout to be in scope through calls
 * across modules.  Your module code really has no idea what other modules may
 * be present in the server, and they may not take too kindly to having a
 * longjmp() happen -- it could result in corrupted state.  Heck they may not
 * even take to kindly to a soft_timeout()... because it can cause EINTR to
 * happen on pretty much any syscall, and unless all the libraries and modules
 * in use are known to deal well with EINTR it could cause corruption as well.
 * But things are likely to do much better with a soft_timeout in scope than a
 * hard_timeout.
 *
 * A module MAY NOT use a hard_timeout() across * sub_req_lookup_xxx()
 * functions, or across run_sub_request() functions.  A module SHOULD NOT use a
 * soft_timeout() in either of these cases, but sometimes there's just no
 * choice.
 *
 * kill_timeout() will disarm either variety of timeout.
 *
 * reset_timeout() resets the timeout in progress.

/* pools have nested lifetimes -- sub_pools are destroyed when the
 * parent pool is cleared.  We allow certain liberties with operations
 * on things such as tables (and on other structures in a more general
 * sense) where we allow the caller to insert values into a table which
 * were not allocated from the table's pool.  The table's data will
 * remain valid as long as all the pools from which its values are
 * allocated remain valid.
 *
 * For example, if B is a sub pool of A, and you build a table T in
 * pool B, then it's safe to insert data allocated in A or B into T
 * (because B lives at most as long as A does, and T is destroyed when
 * B is cleared/destroyed).  On the other hand, if S is a table in
 * pool A, it is safe to insert data allocated in A into S, but it
 * is *not safe* to insert data allocated from B into S... because
 * B can be cleared/destroyed before A is (which would leave dangling
 * pointers in T's data structures).
 *
 * In general we say that it is safe to insert data into a table T
 * if the data is allocated in any ancestor of T's pool.  This is the
 * basis on which the POOL_DEBUG code works -- it tests these ancestor
 * relationships for all data inserted into tables.  POOL_DEBUG also
 * provides tools (ap_find_pool, and ap_pool_is_ancestor) for other
 * folks to implement similar restrictions for their own data
 * structures.
 *
 * However, sometimes this ancestor requirement is inconvenient --
 * sometimes we're forced to create a sub pool (such as through
 * ap_sub_req_lookup_uri), and the sub pool is guaranteed to have
 * the same lifetime as the parent pool.  This is a guarantee implemented
 * by the *caller*, not by the pool code.  That is, the caller guarantees
 * they won't destroy the sub pool individually prior to destroying the
 * parent pool.
 *
 * In this case the caller must call ap_pool_join() to indicate this
 * guarantee to the POOL_DEBUG code.  There are a few examples spread
 * through the standard modules.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the
#       C Language, BSD/Berkeley Unix; 386BSD, NetBSD 1.1 and OpenBSD.
#
# Anyone who obtained a copy of this work is hereby permitted to freely use,
# distribute, modify, merge, sublicence, give away or sell it as long as the
# authors are given due credit and the following notice is retained:
#
# This work is provided "as is", with no explicit or implicit warranty what-
# soever. Use it only at your own risk. In no event may an author or contri-
# butor be held liable for any damage, directly or indirectly, that origina-
# ted through or is caused by creation or modification of this work.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

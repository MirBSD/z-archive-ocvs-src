# logresolve.pl
#
# v 1.2 by robh @@ imdb.com
#
# usage: logresolve.pl <infile >outfile
#
# input = Apache/NCSA/.. logfile with IP numbers at start of lines
# output = same logfile with IP addresses resolved to hostnames where
#  name lookups succeeded.
#
# this differs from the C based 'logresolve' in that this script
# spawns a number ($CHILDREN) of subprocesses to resolve addresses
# concurrently and sets a short timeout ($TIMEOUT) for each lookup in
# order to keep things moving quickly.
#
# the parent process handles caching of IP->hostnames using a Perl hash
# it also avoids sending the same IP to multiple child processes to be
# resolved multiple times concurrently.
#
# Depending on the settings of $CHILDREN and $TIMEOUT you should see
# significant reductions in the overall time taken to resolve your
# logfiles. With $CHILDREN=40 and $TIMEOUT=5 I've seen 200,000 - 300,000
# logfile lines processed per hour compared to ~45,000 per hour
# with 'logresolve'.
#
# I haven't yet seen any noticable reduction in the percentage of IPs
# that fail to get resolved. Your mileage will no doubt vary. 5s is long
# enough to wait IMO.
#
# Known to work with FreeBSD 2.2
# Known to have problems with Solaris
#
# 980417 - use 'sockaddr_un' for bind/connect to make the script work
#  with linux. Fix from Luuk de Boer <luuk_de_boer@@pi.net>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

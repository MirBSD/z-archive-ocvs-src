@update to an older version of my httpd work
@

@Support files:

ab
	ABuse your server with this benchmarker. Rudimentary
	command line testing tool.

	To compile with SSL support; specify the compile
	time flag 'USE_SSL'. E.g. during configure do:

	CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include -DUSE_SSL " \
		LIBS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib -lssl -lcrypt"
		./configure ...

	SSL support is even more rudimentary and experimental
	than ab itself :-).

apachectl
	Apache run-time Control script. To facilitate the
	administrator and/or your rc.d scripts to control the
	functioning of the Apache httpd daemon.

apxs
	APache eXtenSion tool. Eases building and installing
	DSO style modules.

dbmmanage
	Create and update user authentication files in the faster
	DBM format used by mod_auth_db.

htdigest
	Create and update user authentication files used in
	DIGEST authentification. See mod_auth_digest.

htpasswd
	Create and update user authentication files used in
	BASIC authentification. I.e. the htpasswd files.
	See mod_auth.

httpd.8
	General apache man page.

log_server_status
	This script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by something
	like cron.  It connects to the server and downloads the status
	information.  It reformats the information to a single line and logs
	it to a file.

logresolve
	resolve hostnames for IP-adresses in Apache logfiles

phf_abuse_log.cgi
	This script can be used to detect people trying to abuse an ancient
	and long plugged security hole which existed in a CGI script distributed
	with Apache 1.0.3 and earlier versions.

rotatelogs
	rotate Apache logs without having to kill the server.

split-logfile
	This script will take a combined virtual hosts access
	log file and break its contents into separate files.

suexec
	Switch User For Exec. Used internally by apache,
        see  the  document  `Apache  suEXEC  Support'
	under http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .

SHA1
	This directory includes some utilities to allow Apache 1.3.6 to
	recognize passwords in SHA1 format, as used by Netscape web
	servers. It is not installed by default.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

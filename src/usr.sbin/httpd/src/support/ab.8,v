.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ab
is a tool for benchmarking the performance of your Apache HyperText Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) server.  It does this by giving you an indication of how
many requests per second your Apache installation can serve.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B \-k
Enable the HTTP KeepAlive feature; that is, perform multiple requests
within one HTTP session. Default is no KeepAlive.
.TP 12
.B \-d
Do not display the "percentage served within XX [ms] table". (legacy
support).
.TP 12
.B \-S
Do not display the median and standard deviation values, nor display
the warning/error messages when the average and median are more than
one or two times the standard deviation apart. And default to the
min/avg/max values. (legacy support).
.TP 12
.B \-s
When compiled in (bb -h will show you) use the SSL protected
.B https
rather than the
.B http
protocol. This feature is experimental and
.B very
rudimentary. You propably do not want to use it.
.TP 12
.B \-k
Enable the HTTP KeepAlive feature; that is, perform multiple requests
within one HTTP session. Default is no KeepAlive.
.B \-i
Use an HTTP 'HEAD' instead of the GET method. Cannot be mixed with POST.
.TP 12
.BI \-n " requests"
The number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session.  The
default is to perform just one single request, which will not give
representative benchmarking results.
.TP 12
.BI \-t " timelimit"
The number of seconds to spend benchmarking. Using this option automatically
set the number of requests for the benchmarking session to 50000.
Use this to benchmark the server for a fixed period of time.  By
default, there is no timelimit.
.TP 12
.BI \-c " concurrency"
The number of simultaneous requests to perform. The default is to
perform one HTTP request at a time, that is, no concurrency.

.TP 12
.BI \-p " POST file"
A file containing data that the program will send to the Apache server in
any HTTP POST requests.

.TP 12
.BI \-A " Authorization username:password"
Supply Basic Authentication credentials to the server. The username
and password are separated by a single ':', and sent as uuencoded data.
The string is sent regardless of whether the server needs it; that is,
has sent a 401 Authentication needed.

.TP 12
.BI \-X " proxy[:port]"
Route all requests through the proxy (at optional port).

.TP 12
.BI \-P " Proxy-Authorization username:password"
Supply Basic Authentication credentials to a proxy en-route. The username
and password are separated by a single ':', and sent as uuencoded data.
The string is sent regardless of whether the proxy needs it; that is,
has sent a 407 Proxy authentication needed.

.TP 12
.BI \-C " Cookie name=value"
Add a 'Cookie:' line to the request. The argument is typically
a 'name=value' pair. This option may be repeated.

.TP 12
.BI \-p " Header string"
Append extra headers to the request. The argument is typically in the form
of a valid header line, usually a colon separated field value pair, for
example, 'Accept-Encoding: zip/zop;8bit'.

.TP 12
.BI \-T " content-type"
The content-type header to use for POST data.

.TP 12
.BI \-g " gnuplot file"
Write all measured values out as a 'gnuplot' or TSV (Tab separate values)
file. This file can easily be imported into packages like Gnuplot, IDL, Mathematica,
Igor or even Excell. The labels are on the first line of the file.

.TP 12
.BI \-q
When processing more than 150 requsts;
.B ab
outputs a progress count on
.B stderr
every 10% or 100 requests or so. The
.B -q
flag qill suppress these messages.

.TP 12
.BI \-e " CSV file"
Write a Comma separated value (CSV) file which contains for each
percentage (from 1% to 100%) the time (in milli seconds) it took
to serve that percentage of the requests. This is usually more
usefull than the 'gnuplot' file; as the results are already
'binned'.

.TP 12
.B \-v
Sets the verbosity level.  Level 4 and above prints information on headers,
level 3 and above prints response codes (for example, 404, 200), and level 2
and above prints warnings and informational messages.

.TP 12
.BI \-w
Print out results in HTML tables.  The default table is two columns wide,
with a white background.
.TP 12
.BI \-x " attributes"
The string to use as attributes for <table>.  Attributes are inserted
<table
.B here
>
.TP 12
.BI \-y " attributes"
The string to use as attributes for <tr>.
.TP 12
.BI \-z " attributes"
The string to use as attributes for <td>.
.TP 12
.B \-V
Display the version number and exit.
.TP 12
.B \-h
Display usage information.
.PD
.SH BUGS
There are various statically declared buffers of fixed length. Combined
with inefficient parsing of the command line arguments, the response headers
from the server, and other external inputs, these buffers might overflow.
.P
.B Ab
does not implement HTTP/1.x fully; instead, it only accepts
some 'expected' forms of responses.
.P
The rather heavy use of
.BR strstr(3)
by the program may skew performance results, since it uses significant
CPU resources.  Make sure that performance limits are not hit by
.B ab
before your server's limit is reached.
.P
The HTML output is not as complete as the text output.
.P
Up to version 1.3d
.B ab
has propably reported values way to low for most measurements;
as a single timeout (which is usually in the order of seconds)
will shift several thousands of milli-second responses by a
considerable factor. This was further componded by a serious
integer overrun which would for realistic run's (i.e. those
longer than a few minutes) produce believable but totally
bogus results. Thanks to Sander Temme for solving this riddle.

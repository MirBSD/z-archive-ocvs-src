.Sh NAME
.Nm quot
.Nd display disk space occupied by each user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quot
.Op Fl acfhknv
.Op Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to gather statistics about the disk usage for each local user.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Include statistics for all mounted filesystems.
.It Fl c
Display three columns containing number of blocks per file,
number of files in this category, and aggregate total of
blocks in files with this or lower size.
.It Fl f
For each user, display count of files and space occupied.
.It Fl h
Estimate the number of blocks in each file based on its size.
Despite that this doesn't give the correct results (it doesn't
account for the holes in files), this option isn't any faster
and thus is discouraged.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
options causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl n
Given a list of inodes (plus some optional data on each line)
in the standard input, for each file print out the owner (plus
the remainder of the input line).
This is traditionally used in the pipe:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot -n filesystem
.Ed
.Pp
to get a report of files and their owners.
.It Fl v
In addition to the default output, display the number of files
not accessed within 30, 60 and 90 days.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

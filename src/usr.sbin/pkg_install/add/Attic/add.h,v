@* from now on, you can specify pkg_add(1) whether it should use
  cat, less, more or ${PAGER:-more} as the displaying programme
  for packet MESSAGEs (the latter was default).
  Using cat can be useful for bulk unattended installations.

  Annoyed myself and reminded by franciszek holop <fred@@pentacom.sk>
* whitespace cleanup
* use new MirOS-style RCS IDs
* documentation fixes

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_scan
.Nd populate a MirPorts shared directories database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl df
.Ar target
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes the packaging lists of all installed MirPorts packages for
.Cm @@dirrm
directives, and counts the number of times each directory within
.Ev $LOCALBASE
is referenced.
It then writes the information into a temporary MirPorts-style shareddirs
database file, which is copied over
.Pa target .
If
.Pa target
already exists,
.Nm
aborts with an error, unless the
.Fl f
option is given.
If the
.Fl d
option is given, a dry run is performed, which can be done as non-root.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /var/db/shareddirs.db
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li $ pkg_scan -f
.Pp
Convert, at your own risk, a
.Mx
\#7ter to a
.Mx
\#7quater system once.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Mx
\#7-stable.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@@66h.42h.de
designed the
.Mx
package tools changes for MirPorts after the
.Ox
project decided to rewrite their packaging tools in perl.
.Pp
.An Benny Siegert Aq bsiegert@@66h.42h.de
originated the idea and most of the code for
.Nm "" .

.Dt MAILER.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mailer.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr mailwrapper 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf
contains a series of pairs.
The first member of each pair is the name of a program invoking
.Xr mailwrapper 8
which is typically a symbolic link to
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail .
(On a typical system,
.Xr newaliases 8
and
.Xr mailq 8
would be set up this way.)
The second member of each pair is the name of the program to
actually execute when the first name is invoked.
The file may also contain comments, denoted by a
.Ql #
character in the first column of any line.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of how to set up
.Nm
for traditional
.Xr sendmail 8
invocation behavior.
.Bd -literal
# Execute the "real" sendmail program, named /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
sendmail	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
send-mail	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
mailq		/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
hoststat	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
purgestat	/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
.Ed
.Pp
This example shows how to invoke the
.Sy postfix
MTA suite in place of
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.Bd -literal
# Emulate sendmail using postfix
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
send-mail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
mailq		/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
newaliases	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/mailer.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/mailer.conf
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr mailq 8 ,
.Xr mailwrapper 8 ,
.Xr newaliases 8 ,
.Xr sendmail 8
.Sh AUTHORS
Perry E. Metzger <perry@@piermont.com>
.Sh BUGS
The entire reason this program exists is a crock. Instead, a command
for how to submit mail should be standardized, and all the "behave
differently if invoked with a different name" behavior of things like
.Xr mailq 8
should go away.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

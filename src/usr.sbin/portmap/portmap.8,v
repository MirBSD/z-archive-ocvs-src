.Sh NAME
.Nm portmap
.Nd
.Tn DARPA
port to
.Tn RPC
program number mapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm portmap
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm portmap
is a server that converts
.Tn RPC
program numbers into
.Tn DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make
.Tn RPC
calls.
.Pp
When an
.Tn RPC
server is started, it will tell
.Nm portmap
what port number it is listening to, and what
.Tn RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.Tn RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm portmap
on the server machine, port
.Dv PMAP_PORT
(defined in
.Aq Pa rpc/pmap_prot.h
to 111) to determine
the port number where
.Tn RPC
packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm portmap
must be started before any
.Tn RPC
servers are invoked.
.Pp
Normally
.Nm portmap
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.Nm portmap
then logs errors using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
Option available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
(debug) prevents
.Nm portmap
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inetd.conf 5 ,
.Xr inetd 8 ,
.Xr rpcinfo 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3
.Sh BUGS
If
.Nm portmap
crashes, all servers must be restarted.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

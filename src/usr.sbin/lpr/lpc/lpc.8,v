.Sh NAME
.Nm lpc
.Nd line printer control program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lpc
.Bk -words
.Oo
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Oc
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used by the system administrator to control the
operation of the line printer system.
For each line printer configured in
.Pa /etc/printcap ,
.Nm
may be used to:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
disable or enable a printer,
.It
disable or enable a printer's spooling queue,
.It
rearrange the order of jobs in a spooling queue,
.It
find the status of printers, and their associated
spooling queues and printer daemons.
.El
.Pp
Without any arguments,
.Nm
will prompt for commands from the standard input.
If arguments are supplied,
.Nm
interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
arguments as parameters to the command.
The standard input may be redirected causing
.Nm
to read commands from file.
Commands may be abbreviated;
the following is the list of recognized commands.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic \&? No [ Ar command Ar ... ]
.It Ic help No [ Ar command Ar ... ]
Print a short description of each command specified in the argument list,
or, if no argument is given, a list of the recognized commands.
.Pp
.It Ic abort  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately and
then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being started by
.Xr lpr 1 )
for the specified printers.
.Pp
.It Ic clean  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Remove any temporary files, data files, and control files that cannot
be printed (i.e., do not form a complete printer job)
from the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.
.Pp
.It Ic disable  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Turn the specified printer queues off.
This prevents new printer jobs from being entered into the queue by
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
.It Xo Ic down No {\ all\ |\ printer\ } Ar message
.Op Ar ...
.Xc
Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
.Em message
in the printer status file.
The message doesn't need to be quoted, the
remaining arguments are treated like
.Xr echo 1 .
This is normally used to take a printer down and let users know why.
.Xr lpq 1
will indicate the printer is down and print the status message.
.Pp
.It Ic enable  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Enable spooling on the local queue for the listed printers.
This will allow
.Xr lpr 1
to put new jobs in the spool queue.
.Pp
.It Ic exit
.It Ic quit
Exit from
.Nm lpc .
.Pp
.It Ic restart  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Attempt to start a new printer daemon.
This is useful when some abnormal condition causes the daemon to
die unexpectedly, leaving jobs in the queue.
.Xr lpq 1
will report that there is no daemon present when this condition occurs.
If the user is the superuser,
try to abort the current daemon first (i.e., kill and restart a stuck daemon).
.Pp
.It Ic start  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Enable printing and start a spooling daemon for the listed printers.
.Pp
.It Ic status  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Display the status of daemons and queues on the local machine.
.Pp
.It Ic stop  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Stop a spooling daemon after the current job completes and disable
printing.
.Pp
.It Ic topq No printer\ [\ jobnum\ ...\ ]\ [\ user\ ...\ ]
Place the jobs in the order listed at the top of the printer queue.
.Pp
.It Ic up  No {\ all\ |\ printer\ }
Enable everything and start a new printer daemon.
Undoes the effects of
.Ic down .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/spool/output/*/lock -compact
.It Pa /etc/printcap

.It Pa /var/spool/output/*

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

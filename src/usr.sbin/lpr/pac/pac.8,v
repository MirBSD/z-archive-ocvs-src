.Sh NAME
.Nm pac
.Nd printer/plotter accounting information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pac
.Op Fl cmrs
.Bk -words
.Op Fl P Ns Ar printer
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Fl p Ns Ar price
.Ek
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm pac
reads the printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating the number
of pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster devices)
of paper consumed by each named
.Ar user ,
and prints out how much each user consumed in pages or feet and dollars.
.Pp
When no
.Ar user
arguments are given, statistics are printed for every user who has used any
paper.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl P Ns Ar printer
Accounting is done for the named printer.
Normally, accounting is done for the default printer (site dependent) or
the value of the environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
is used.
.It Fl c
Causes the output to be sorted by cost; usually the
output is sorted alphabetically by name.
.It Fl m
Causes the host name to be ignored in the accounting file.
This allows for a user on multiple machines to have all of his printing
charges grouped together.
.It Fl p Ns Ar price
The value
.Ar price
is used for the cost in dollars instead of the default value of 0.02
or the price specified in
.Pa /etc/printcap .
.It Fl r
Reverse the sorting order.
.It Fl s
Accounting information is summarized on the
summary accounting file; this summarization is necessary since on a
busy system, the accounting file can grow by several lines per day.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
.Nm
formats the output into a simple table, using four columns:
.Bl -enum
.It
The host name followed by the user's login name (column "Login").
If the
.Fl m
option was specified, the host name will be omitted.
.It
The number of pages or feet printed (column "pages/feet").
.It
The number of copies made (column "runs").
.It
The total price for the user (column "price").
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar user
argument was specified,
.Nm
will print a summary line with print totals.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/account/?_sum -compact
.It Pa /var/account/?acct
raw accounting files
.It Pa /var/account/?_sum
summary accounting files
.It Pa /etc/printcap
printer capability database
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr printcap 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The relationship between the computed price and reality is
as yet unknown.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

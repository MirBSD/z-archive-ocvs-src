Output filter specifications
.PP
The filters supplied with OpenBSD
handle printing and accounting for most common
line printers, the Benson-Varian, the wide (36") and
narrow (11") Versatec printer/plotters. For other devices or accounting
methods, it may be necessary to create a new filter.
.PP
Filters are spawned by \fIlpd\fP
with their standard input the data to be printed, and standard output
the printer.  The standard error is attached to the
.B lf
file for logging errors or \fIsyslogd\fP may be used for logging errors.
A filter must return a 0 exit
code if there were no errors, 1 if the job should be reprinted,
and 2 if the job should be thrown away.
When \fIlprm\fP
sends a kill signal to the \fIlpd\fP process controlling
printing, it sends a SIGINT signal 
to all filters and descendents of filters.
This signal can be trapped by filters that need
to do cleanup operations such as
deleting temporary files.
.PP
Arguments passed to a filter depend on its type.
The
.B of
filter is called with the following arguments.
.DS
\fIfilter\fP \fB\-w\fPwidth \fB\-l\fPlength
.DE
The \fIwidth\fP and \fIlength\fP values come from the
.B pw
and
.B pl
entries in the printcap database.
The
.B if
filter is passed the following parameters.
.DS
\fIfilter\fP [\|\fB\-c\fP\|] \fB\-w\fPwidth \fB\-l\fPlength \fB\-i\fPindent \fB\-n\fP login \fB\-h\fP host accounting_file
.DE
The
.B \-c
flag is optional, and only supplied when control characters
are to be passed uninterpreted to the printer (when using the
.B \-l
option of
.I lpr
to print the file).
The
.B \-w
and
.B \-l
parameters are the same as for the
.B of
filter.
The
.B \-n
and
.B \-h
parameters specify the login name and host name of the job owner.
The last argument is the name of the accounting file from
.IR printcap .
.PP
All other filters are called with the following arguments:
.DS
\fIfilter\fP \fB\-x\fPwidth \fB\-y\fPlength \fB\-n\fP login \fB\-h\fP host accounting_file
.DE
The
.B \-x
and
.B \-y
options specify the horizontal and vertical page
size in pixels (from the
.B px
and
.B py
entries in the printcap file).
The rest of the arguments are the same as for the
.B if
filter.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Dt MOUNT_MSDOS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_msdos
.Nd mount an MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_msdos
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl 9
.Op Fl G
.Op Fl x
.Ar special
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the MS-DOS filesystem residing on
the device
.Ar special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Ar node .
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using the syntax
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Nm mount Op options
-t msdos
.Ar special Ar node
.Ed
.Pp
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
MS-DOS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 .
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a mask of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.)
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The default mask is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl s
Force behaviour to
ignore and not generate Windows 95/98 long filenames.
.It Fl l
Force listing and generation of
Windows 95/98 long filenames
and separate creation/modification/access dates.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl s
nor
.Fl l
are given,
.Nm
searches the root directory of the filesystem to
be mounted for any existing Windows 95/98 long filenames.
If no such entries are found,
.Fl s
is the default.
Otherwise
.Fl l
is assumed.
.It Fl 9
Ignore the special Windows 95/98 directory entries even
if deleting or renaming a file.
This forces
.Fl s .
.It Fl G
This option causes the filesystem to be interpreted as an Atari-Gemdos
filesystem.
The differences to the msdos filesystem are minimal and
limited to the boot block.
This option enforces
.Fl s .
.It Fl x
If a directory is readable, it inherits the x attribute as well.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 0.9 .
Its predecessor, the
.Nm mount_pcfs
utility, appeared in
.Nx 0.8 ,
and was abandoned in favor
of the more aptly named
.Nm mount_msdos .
.Sh CAVEATS
The use of the
.Fl 9
flag could result in damaged filesystems,
albeit the damage is in part taken care of by
procedures similar to the ones used in Windows 95/98.
.Pp
The default handling for
.Fl s
and
.Fl l
will result in empty filesystems being populated
with short filenames only.
To generate long filenames on empty DOS file systems use
.Fl l .
.Pp
Note that Windows 95/98 handles only access dates,
but not access times.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

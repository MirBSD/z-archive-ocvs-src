.Sh NAME
.Nm wsconsctl
.Nd get or set wscons state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl n
.Fl a
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl n
.Ar name ...
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name=value ...
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name+=value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various wscons system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
.It Fl w Ar name=value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
The value can be specified as either an absolute, by using the
.Ql =
symbol,
or as a relative value, by using the
.Ql +=
symbol.
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for more details.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name in the output.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be used to view and modify aspects of the keyboard,
display, and mouse using the standard, machine-independent
workstation console device driver
.Xr wscons 4 .
.Pp
The keyboard type can be modified, the keyboard bell's pitch, period,
and duration can be modified,
the
.Ar typematic
value can be changed, and the keyboard encoding can be modified
to switch keys, should the user find a keyboard's default layout
difficult to use.
.Pp
There are also definitions relating to video
control and cursor control, which are not applicable to
all display types, and to text emulation and graphics
(mapped) modes.
.Pp
Use the
.Xr kbd 8
utility to determine which keyboard encodings are available for your
country.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=uk
.Pp
Sets a UK keyboard encoding.
.Pp
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.map+="keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"
.Pp
Modifies the current keyboard encoding so that, when the
.Ar Caps Lock
key is pressed, the same encoding sequence as
.Ar Left Control
is sent.
For a full list of keysyms, and keycodes, please refer
to the
.Ar /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsksymdef.h
file.
.Pp
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.map+="keycode 184=Mode_switch"
.Pp
Assigns the
.Ar Right Alt
key to be the group modifier (layout is changed while the key is pressed).
.Pp
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.map+="keycode 157=Mode_Lock"
.Pp
Assigns the
.Ar Right Control
key to be the lock for the group modifier.
.Pp
The effect of
.Ar Mode_Lock
and
.Ar Mode_switch
is not mutually exclusive, to be consistant with
.Ar Caps Lock
and
.Ar Shift
behaviour.
.Pp
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=us.swapctrlcaps
.Pp
Sets a US keyboard encoding, with the
.Ar Caps Lock
and
.Ar Left Control
keys swapped.
The
.Ar .swapctrlcaps
encoding does not work for all national keyboard encodings.
For most purposes, the ability to set the value returned
by the
.Ar Caps Lock
key is enough - see the previous example for details.
.Pp
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.bell.pitch=1200
.Pp
Sets the bell pitch to be 1200.
.Pp
.Li # wsconsctl -w keyboard.bell.pitch+=200
.Pp
Adds 200 to the current pitch of the bell.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

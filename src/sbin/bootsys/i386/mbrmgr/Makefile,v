@you wouldn't believe me, if I started telling you which cool features
the new two MBR set has, and I won't tell you anyways, especially not

go figure yourself, the code is pretty well documented, and this time
I've not reduced room by tricks but rather by reducing message size -
they're still more informative than before tho.

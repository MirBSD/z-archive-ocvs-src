@I'm sick that every piece of code has got to have its own version
number - just use the MirOS patchlevel for the bootloader.

Also, rename /usr/mdec/pbr_ffs to ffspbr for a better tabcomplete,
now that we've got the pxeboot

@man, what must I have been smoking (well, passively - I've got to ask
what the others in the Netzladen[.org] have been smoking) when I coded
this bootsector... no wonder it had weird issues in bochs.

Fixed in v2.70:
* don't overwrite second sector loaded with magic bytes
* if LBA fails, don't repeat forever until after Armaggedon,
  instead try CHS loads immediately (well, after <n> retries)

Added in v2.70:
* for fdisk(8), there is an additional field in the PBR API,
  which allows to set a different timeout than 10 seconds,
  but only during an (u)pdate, as the machine code is modified
  no code in fdisk for that yet, sorry

@* fix thinko introduced in last version (mov ecx,edi -> mov edi,ecx)
  probably caused by reading too much bad AT&T syntax code, which
  prevented the 10 second timeout from working
* bump version number accordingly
* echo/printf -> print conversion ("we use ksh anyways")
* remove separate LICENCE file; BSD spirit is to licence per file
* cleanup and simplify

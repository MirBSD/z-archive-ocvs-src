.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm reboot ,
.Nm halt
.Nd stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl dnpq
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl dnq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm halt
and
.Nm reboot
utilities flush the file system cache to disk, run the system
shutdown script, send all running processes a
.Dv SIGTERM
.Pq and subsequently a Dv SIGKILL ,
and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the login
accounting file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Causes system to create a dump before rebooting.
This option is useful for debugging system dump procedures or
capturing the state of a corrupted or misbehaving system.
See
.Xr savecore 8
for information on how to recover this dump.
.It Fl n
Prevent file system cache from being flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl q
Quick.
The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the file system cache is performed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl p
Causes the system to power down, if it is being halted, and the
hardware supports automatic power down.
(Currently supported on some i386, mac68k, macppc, sparc and sparc64 platforms.)
.El
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rc.shutdown -compact
.It Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
script which is run at shutdown time

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

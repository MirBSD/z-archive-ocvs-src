@employ our own idea of a MirBSD disklabel and partition type:
 0xA6 OpenBSD is used as fall-back
 0x27 MirBSD disklabel is the new type
reason: addition of FS_* constants in sys/sys/disklabel.h
might get us outta sync with OpenBSD laters (NTFS here)

talk about "slices" in disklabel
remove trailing newlines etc. in fdisk

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

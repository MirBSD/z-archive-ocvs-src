.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vexec.conf
.Nd verified exec (vexec) configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the main database for vexec fingerprint information. It contains
lines describing files, their associated fingerprints, and access
modes.
.Pp
.Nm
contains lines with fields (separated by one or more whitespaces)
in the following form:
.Pp
.Dl path   type   fingerprint   options
.Pp
Where 
.Em path
is the absolute path to the file and 
.Em fingerprint
is a hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for the 
file.
.Pp
.Em Type
is the type of fingerprint used, currently this may be either
.Dq MD5 ,
.Dq SHA1 ,
or
.Dq RMD160 ;
but other types may be available depending on kernel support.
.Pp
.Em Options
are the associated options for the executable. Currently there are three 
valid options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width INDIRECT -compact
.It DIRECT
The file may be executed in any form.
.Pp
.It INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, and
can only be used as an interpreter in scripts ("hash-bang").
.Pp
.It FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a regular file, not an
executable. Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
.El
.Pp
If neither of the options is specified, 
.Dq DIRECT
is assumed.
.Pp
To allow splitting large databases over several files, the
.Dq include
keyword is introduced. It takes the form of:
.Pp
.Dl include filename
.Pp
Where
.Em filename
is a path to the file to be included. Any path that
.Xr fopen 3
can handle is okay. By default, include depth is limited to 16, which
should be more than enough.
.Pp
Comments start with a
.Sq \&#
character and span to the end of the line.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Below are some examples of entries you could use. Just don't forget to
.Em generate your own fingerprints!
.Pp
Don't run trojanned copies of
.Cm OpenSSH :
.Pp
.Dl /usr/bin/ssh MD5 41a0ea2ea0b2b70674110a5a81110e1d
.Pp
Make
.Cm perl
available only in scripts:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/bin/perl MD5 466a8291a48afe74e1782918f889b506 INDIRECT
.Pp
Get notification of changes in
.Em pf.conf
when loading a ruleset with bad fingerprint:
.Pp
.Dl /etc/pf.conf MD5 93427f18bd0097987e35e04a68fd1875 FILE
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vexecctl 8 ,
.Xr vexec 4
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .1
as a part of
.Dq verifiedexec .
An
.Ox
port first appeared in Stephanie for
.Ox 3.2 .

1.1.2.2
log
@* y.tab.c is a generated file
* whitespace cleanup
* remove $Id tags, because they are overwritten
  by cvs anyways. The importer should either have
  changed them to read $Stephanie$ or whatever
  source they have been taken from, or changed the
  first dollar sign to an underscore (for an example,
  see /sys/arch/i386/conf/RAMDISK*).

log
@Second round:
 * add BSD licence template to the manual pages, as per
	Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0312031317370.17797@@fatboy.ethernet.org>
   (realname guessed, waiting for confirmation)
 * add wbx@@ and myself
 * restructure boilerplate comments in vexecctl.c, they're too large

Now missing: the lex and yacc sources.
We don't need nor want copyrights on .h files if possible,
nor on configuration file{s, samples}.

1.1.2.4
log
@According to Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0312031352020.19175@@fatboy.ethernet.org>
this person does not want his full name to be publically known.

I am not very happy with this situation, so this code cannot
currently be part of MirOS.

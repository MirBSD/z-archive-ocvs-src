.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vexecctl
.Nd load verified exec (vexec) fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Ar fingerprint_db
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
loads the fingerprints in
.Ar fingerprint_db
to the kernel's fingerprint table. Once loaded, the kernel can validate 
executed programs (or opened files) against the table, and report, or 
otherwise take action, on fingerprint mismatches.
.Pp
.Nm
can only load data when the machine is single-user.
.Pp
If the
.Fl v
option is set
.Nm
will go into verbose mode, providing more information on what it's 
doing. Otherwise, only errors will be printed (to stderr).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/vexec.conf" -compact
.It Pa /dev/vexec
The vexec pseudo-device, used to load fingerprint information
.It Pa /etc/vexec.conf
Main fingerprint database
.El
.Sh NOTES
To get vexec support in your kernel, you need to include the vexec device
in the kernel's config file. To do that, just add the following line 
to your kernel's MI, that is, 
.Pa /usr/src/sys/conf/KERNEL_NAME ,
config file:
.Pp
.Dl pseudo-device vexec
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vexec.conf 5 ,
.Xr vexec 4 ,
.Xr stephanie 7
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .1.
An
.Ox
port first appeared in Stephanie for
.Ox 3.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
is a part of vexec, an
.Ox
port of 
.Dq verifiedexec
for
.Nx
by Brett Lymn.
.Pp
The
.Ox
port was written and is maintained by <brian@@ethernet.org>

1.1.2.2
log
@* y.tab.c is a generated file
* whitespace cleanup
* remove $Id tags, because they are overwritten
  by cvs anyways. The importer should either have
  changed them to read $Stephanie$ or whatever
  source they have been taken from, or changed the
  first dollar sign to an underscore (for an example,
  see /sys/arch/i386/conf/RAMDISK*).

@Second round:
 * add BSD licence template to the manual pages, as per
	Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0312031317370.17797@@fatboy.ethernet.org>
   (realname guessed, waiting for confirmation)
 * add wbx@@ and myself
 * restructure boilerplate comments in vexecctl.c, they're too large

Now missing: the lex and yacc sources.
We don't need nor want copyrights on .h files if possible,
nor on configuration file{s, samples}.

1.1.2.4
log
@According to Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0312031352020.19175@@fatboy.ethernet.org>
this person does not want his full name to be publically known.

I am not very happy with this situation, so this code cannot
currently be part of MirOS.

.Dt VEXEC 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm vexec
.Nd Vexec pseudo-device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device vexec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
pseudo-device is used to interface the kernel's Vexec data-structures.
For now, loading is the only operation it supports. Loading can be
done only when the machine is in single-user mode.
.Pp
The parameters passed to the device include the file to which the new
entry references, the fingerprint type and the fingerprint itself, and
access specifications. These are described by the following structure,
defined in
.Pa /usr/include/sys/vexec.h :
.Bd -literal
struct vexec_params {
    u_char vxp_type;		 /* Entry type. */
    u_char vxp_fptype;		 /* Hash type. */
    u_char vxp_file[MAXPATHLEN]; /* Filename. */
    u_char vxp_fp[FPLEN_MAX];	 /* Fingerprint. */
};
.Ed
.Pp
As mentioned, the only operation this pseudo-device is supporting now
is loading, and the respective ioctl request for loading is
.Dv VEXEC_LOAD .
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following example will load information (supposedly) associated
with the program
.Pa /bin/ls
to the kernel's table:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct vexec_params p;
int fd;

fd = open("/dev/vexec", O_WRONLY, 0);
if (fd == -1)
	err(1, NULL);

p.vxp_file = strdup("/bin/ls");
p.vxp_fp = strdup("477c2e94a4c1b235c482978331989931");
p.vxp_fptype = FPTYPE_MD5;
p.vxp_type = VEXEC_DIRECT;

if (!p.vxp_file || !p.vxp_fp)
	err(1, NULL);

if (ioctl(fd, VEXEC_LOAD, &p) == -1)
	err(1, "Can't load data");

free(p.vxp_file);
free(p.vxp_fp);

1.1.2.2
log
@* y.tab.c is a generated file
* whitespace cleanup
* remove $Id tags, because they are overwritten
  by cvs anyways. The importer should either have
  changed them to read $Stephanie$ or whatever
  source they have been taken from, or changed the
  first dollar sign to an underscore (for an example,
  see /sys/arch/i386/conf/RAMDISK*).

@Second round:
 * add BSD licence template to the manual pages, as per
	Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0312031317370.17797@@fatboy.ethernet.org>
   (realname guessed, waiting for confirmation)
 * add wbx@@ and myself
 * restructure boilerplate comments in vexecctl.c, they're too large

Now missing: the lex and yacc sources.
We don't need nor want copyrights on .h files if possible,
nor on configuration file{s, samples}.

1.1.2.4
log
@According to Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0312031352020.19175@@fatboy.ethernet.org>
this person does not want his full name to be publically known.

I am not very happy with this situation, so this code cannot
currently be part of MirOS.

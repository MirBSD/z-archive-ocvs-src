 *
 * Stephanie for OpenBSD 3.4
 *
 * This is so small that it could've been simply written three times,
 * but I guess that's what "headers" are for...
 *
 * Uses to track filename/line number per included file, as (f)lex don't
 * do it already. Pointers to those who maintain it:
 *  - Make the yylineno bigger than an integer.
 *  - Add it as a per-state (or -buffer or -context) variable and not
 *    one global.
 *  - An option like "yyfilename" would be nice too. :)
 *
 * These can make (f)lex slower (in numbers, of course), but could be
 * very useful to have. I think...

@* y.tab.c is a generated file
* whitespace cleanup
* remove $Id tags, because they are overwritten
  by cvs anyways. The importer should either have
  changed them to read $Stephanie$ or whatever
  source they have been taken from, or changed the
  first dollar sign to an underscore (for an example,
  see /sys/arch/i386/conf/RAMDISK*).

@Import OpenBSD as of today again (seems pretty stable, I hope)

Prominent changes: more bgpd, tcpmd5; tcpdump/isakmpd fixes

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

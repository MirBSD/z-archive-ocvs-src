1.2
log
@Last piece of OpenBSD 3.5-current merge part I.

Things left:
* merge import in src/gnu/
* fix kernel build (it _is_ broken)

TOP 1 will be done with a _second_ import (easier).
TOP 2 will be done RSN.

----

Also, move RCS IDs to new-style MirOS ones, and fix the
SMM doc, and add output to newfs(8) saying if (!) or if
not (?) it read the random value out of the previous
superblock before making the fs.

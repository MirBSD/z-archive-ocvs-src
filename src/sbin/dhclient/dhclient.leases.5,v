.Sh NAME
.Nm dhclient.leases
.Nd DHCP client lease database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client keeps a persistent
database of leases that it has acquired that are still valid.
The database is a free-form ASCII file containing one valid declaration
per lease.
If more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
the last one in the file is used.
The file is written as a log, so this is not an unusual occurrence.
.Pp
The format of the lease declarations is described in
.Xr dhclient.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
/var/db/dhclient.leases
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dhclient.conf 5 ,
.Xr dhcp-options 5 ,
.Xr dhcpd.conf 5 ,
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
.Xr dhcpd 8
.Pp
RFC 2132, RFC 2131.
.Sh AUTHORS
.Xr dhclient 8
was written by
.An Ted Lemon Aq mellon@@vix.com
under a contract with Vixie Labs.
Funding for this project was provided by the Internet Software Corporation.

@Import OpenBSD as of today again (seems pretty stable, I hope)

Prominent changes: more bgpd, tcpmd5; tcpdump/isakmpd fixes

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

The lease file is named
.Qq dhclient.leases.IFNAME ,
where
.Qq IFNAME
represents the network interface the DHCP client acquired the lease on.
For example, if
.Xr dhclient 8
is configured for the em0 network device,
the lease file will be named
.Qq dhclient.leases.em0 .

.Sh NAME
.Nm umount
.Nd unmount file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm umount
.Op Fl fv
.Ar special | node
.Nm umount
.Fl a
.Op Fl fv
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl t Ar ufs | lfs | external_type
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command
calls the
.Xr unmount 2
system call to remove a
.Ar special
device
or the remote node (rhost:path) from the file system tree at the point
.Ar node .
If neither
.Ar special
nor
.Ar node
are provided, the appropriate information is taken from the
.Xr fstab 5
file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
All of the file systems described in
.Xr fstab 5
are unmounted.
.It Fl f
The file system is forcibly unmounted.
Active special devices continue to work,
but all other files return errors if further accesses are attempted.
The root file system cannot be forcibly unmounted.
.It Fl h Ar host
Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be
unmounted.
This option implies the
.Fl a
option and, unless otherwise specified with the
.Fl t
option, will only unmount NFS filesystems.
.It Fl t Ar "ufs \\*(Ba lfs \\*(Ba external type"
Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on
filesystems of the specified type.
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
For example, the
.Nm
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# umount -a -t nfs,mfs
.Ed
.Pp
umounts all filesystems of the type
.Tn NFS
and
.Tn MFS .
.It Fl v
Verbose, additional information is printed out as each file system
is unmounted.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

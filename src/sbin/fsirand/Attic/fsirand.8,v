.Sh NAME
.Nm fsirand
.Nd randomize inode generation numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsirand
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl p
.Ar special
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command installs random generation numbers on all the inodes for
each filesystem specified on the command line by
.Ar special .
This increases the security of NFS-exported filesystems by making
it difficult to
.Dq guess
filehandles.
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Xr newfs 8
now does the equivalent of
.Nm
itself so it is no longer necessary to
run
.Nm
by hand on a new filesystem.
It is only used to re-randomize or report on an existing filesystem.
.Pp
.Nm
should only be used on an unmounted filesystem that
has been checked with
.Xr fsck 8
or a filesystem that is mounted read-only.
.Nm
may be used on the root filesystem in single-user mode
but the system should be rebooted via
.Dq reboot -n
afterwards.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Use the default block size (usually 512 bytes) instead
of the value gleaned from the disklabel.
.It Fl f
Force
.Nm
to run even if the filesystem on
.Ar special
is not marked as clean.
.It Fl p
Print the current generation numbers for all inodes instead of
generating new ones.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
Since
.Nm
allocates enough memory to hold all the inodes in
a given cylinder group, it may use a large amount
of memory for large disks with few cylinder groups.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fs 5 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr reboot 8
.Sh AUTHORS
Todd C. Miller <Todd.Miller@@courtesan.com>
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in SunOS 3.x.
This version of
.Nm
first appeared in
.Ox 2.1 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Import the complete OpenBSD source tree (base system)
as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the
vendor branch.
Attention: this is a big update. Don't even try to
build this system, OpenBSD 3.4-beta, yet on your own.

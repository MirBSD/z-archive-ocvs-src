.Sh NAME
.Nm mknod
.Nd build special file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mknod
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar name
.Op Cm c | Cm b
.Ar major minor
.Nm mknod
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar name
.Cm p
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates device special files.
Normally the shell script
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
is used to create special files for commonly known devices; it executes
.Nm
with the appropriate arguments and can make all the files required for the
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set the file mode.
.Ar mode
may be absolute or symbolic, as described in
.Xr chmod 1 .
In symbolic mode strings, the
.Ql +
and
.Ql -
operators are interpreted relative to an assumed initial mode of
.Dq a=rw .
.El
.Pp
To make nodes manually, the arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width majorx
.It Ar name
Device or FIFO name.
For example
.Dq sd
for a SCSI disk or a
.Dq pty
for pseudo-devices.
FIFOs may be named arbitrarily by the user.
.It Cm b | Cm c | Cm p
Type of device or FIFO.
If the device is a block type device such as a tape or disk drive which needs
both cooked and raw special files,
the type is
.Cm b .
All other devices are character type devices, such as terminal
and pseudo devices, and are type
.Cm c .
A FIFO (also known as a named pipe) is type
.Cm p .
.It Ar major
The major device number is an integer number which tells the kernel
which device driver entry point to use.
To learn what major device number to use for a particular device,
check the file
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
to see if the device is known.
.It Ar minor
The minor device number tells the kernel which subunit
the node corresponds to on the device; for example,
a subunit may be a filesystem partition
or a tty line.
.Pp
Major and minor device numbers can be given in any format acceptable to
.Xr strtoul 3 ,
so that a leading
.Dq 0x
indicates a hexadecimal number, and a leading
.Dq 0
will cause the number to be interpreted as octal.
.El

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

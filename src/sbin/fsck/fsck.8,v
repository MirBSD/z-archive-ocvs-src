.Sh NAME
.Nm fsck
.Nd filesystem consistency check and interactive repair
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsck
.Op Fl dvpfny
.Op Fl l Ar maxparallel
.Op Fl t Ar fstype
.Op Fl T Ar fstype:fsoptions
.Ar special | node ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command invokes filesystem-specific programs to check the
special devices listed in the
.Xr fstab 5
file or on the command line for consistency.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Debugging mode.
Just print the commands without executing them.
Available only if
.Nm
is compiled to support it.
.It Fl f
Force checking of filesystems, even when they are marked clean (for filesystems
that support this).
.It Fl l Ar maxparallel
Limit the number of parallel checks to
.Ar maxparallel .
By default, the limit is the number of
disks, running one process per disk.
If a smaller limit is given,
the disks are checked round-robin, one filesystem at a time.
.It Fl n
Cause
.Nm
to assume
.Dq no
as the answer to all operator questions, except
.Dq CONTINUE? .
This is assumed to be the default when dealing with filesystems currently
mounted writeable.
.It Fl p
Enter preen mode.
.It Fl t Ar fstype
Invoke fsck only in the comma separated list of filesystem types.
If the list starts with
.Dq no ,
invoke fsck only in the filesystem types that are
.Em not
specified in
the list.
.It Fl v
Print the commands before executing them.
.It Fl y
Cause
.Nm
to assume
.Dq yes
as the answer to all operator questions.
.It Fl T Ar fstype:fsoptions
List of comma separated filesystem specific options for the specified
filesystem type, in the same format as
.Xr mount 8 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/fstab -compact
.It Pa /etc/fstab

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.PP
File System Check Program (\fIfsck_ffs\fR)
is an interactive file system check and repair program.
.I Fsck_ffs
uses the redundant structural information in the
UNIX file system to perform several consistency checks.
If an inconsistency is detected, it is reported
to the operator, who may elect to fix or ignore
each inconsistency.
These inconsistencies result from the permanent interruption
of the file system updates, which are performed every
time a file is modified.
Unless there has been a hardware failure,
.I fsck_ffs
is able to repair corrupted file systems
using procedures based upon the order in which UNIX honors
these file system update requests.
.PP
The purpose of this document is to describe the normal updating
of the file system,
to discuss the possible causes of file system corruption,
and to present the corrective actions implemented
by
.I fsck_ffs.
Both the program and the interaction between the
program and the operator are described.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@Last piece of OpenBSD 3.5-current merge part I.

Things left:
* merge import in src/gnu/
* fix kernel build (it _is_ broken)

TOP 1 will be done with a _second_ import (easier).
TOP 2 will be done RSN.

----

Also, move RCS IDs to new-style MirOS ones, and fix the
SMM doc, and add output to newfs(8) saying if (!) or if
not (?) it read the random value out of the previous
superblock before making the fs.

.Dt KEYCONV 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm keyconv
.Nd DNSSEC/OpenSSL private key converter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm keyconv
.Fl do
.Ar infile Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts between the key formats used by OpenSSL, as produced by
.Xr openssl 1 ,
and DNSSEC, as produced by
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 .
The primary use of
.Nm
is to generate the DNS "KEY" resource records that, when signed, can
be used by
.Xr isakmpd 8
to authenticate an IKE negotiation.
.Pp
For proper operation,
.Ar infile
is expected to contain the private key.
.Pp
The mode of operation is determined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width abc
.It Fl d
Convert from
.Pa DNSSEC
to
.Pa OpenSSL
format.
.It Fl o
Convert from
.Pa OpenSSL
to
.Pa DNSSEC
format.
In this mode,
.Nm
outputs both the private key, plus a
.Em outfile.pubkey
file containing the public key in DNS KEY format.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm dnssec-keygen
command is supplied as part of BIND version 8 and 9 and can currently
be found in the
.Ox
ports collection.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new RSA key for usage both in
.Xr isakmpd 8
and DNSSEC.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
$ openssl genrsa -out testkey.ssl 1024
$ keyconv -d testkey.ssl testkey.dns
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr openssl 1 ,
.Xr isakmpd 8
.Sh HISTORY
This command first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

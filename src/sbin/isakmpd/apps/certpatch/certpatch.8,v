.Sh NAME
.Nm certpatch
.Nd add subjectAltName identities to X.509 certificates
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm certpatch
.Op Fl t Ar identity-type
.Fl i
.Ar identity
.Fl k
.Ar signing-key
.Ar input-certificate output-certificate
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
alters PEM-encoded X.509 certificates by adding a subjectAltName extension
containing an identity used by the signature-based authentication schemes
of the ISAKMP protocol.
After the addition the certificate will be signed
once again with the supplied CA signing key.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl t Ar identity-type
If given, the
.Fl t
option specifies the type of the given identity.
Currently
.Li ip ,
.Li fqdn ,
and
.Li ufqdn
are recognized.
The default is
.Li ip .
.It Fl i Ar identity
The
.Fl i
option takes an argument which is the identity to put into the
subjectAltName field of the certificate.
If the identity-type is
.Li ip ,
this argument should be an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation.
.It Fl k Ar signing-key
The
.Fl k
option specifies the key used for signing the certificate once the
subjectAltName extension has been added.
The key is specified by
the filename where it is stored in PEM format.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

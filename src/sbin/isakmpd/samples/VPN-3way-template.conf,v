# A configuration sample for the isakmpd ISAKMP/Oakley (aka IKE) daemon.
#
# This is a template file of a VPN setup beteween three nodes in
# a fully meshed 'three-way' configuration. Suggested use is to copy
# this file to all three nodes and then edit them accordingly.
#
# These nodes are initially called XXX, YYY and ZZZ.
#
# In pseudographics:   XXX --- YYY
#                         \   /
#                          ZZZ
#
# In cases where IP/network adresses should be defined values like
# 192.168.XXX.nnn have been used.
#

# Incoming phase 1 negotiations are multiplexed on the source IP
# address. In the three-way VPN, we have two possible peers.

[Phase 1]
192.168.YYY.nnn=	ISAKMP-peer-node-YYY
192.168.ZZZ.nnn=	ISAKMP-peer-node-ZZZ

# These connections are walked over after config file parsing and
# told to the application layer so that it will inform us when
# traffic wants to pass over them.  This means we can do on-demand
# keying. In the three-way VPN, each node knows two connections.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

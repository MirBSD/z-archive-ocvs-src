@* merge
* fix a time_t bug I apparently introduced,
  which would show up in ~2038
* fix some more time_t and bcopy stuff
* fix all the Makefiles (bad ho@@!)
* check for tests

There's quite some discussion ongoing at license-discuss@@opensource.org
recently, not only about licences. The D-FSL was submitted, and it's
apparent that we can be liable for known bugs in our code too, depending
on the mood of the judge. That's why I rather full-update this one.
We're now en par with #7-stable again.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

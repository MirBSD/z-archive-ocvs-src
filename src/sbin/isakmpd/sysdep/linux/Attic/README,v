Currently, you have to manually configure any IPsec interfaces and do the
association betweent these and the physical ones.  This is done like
this in FreeS/WAN:

ipsec tncfg --attach --virtual ipsec0 --physical eth0
ifconfig ipsec0 A.B.C.D netmask E.F.G.H

Then there is one special configuration option in the IPsec-connection
sections for Phase 2 of the configuration file, named Next-hop, which
should be set to the next hop's IP address along the way to the peer:

Next-hop=	I.J.K.L

This is specific to the way FreeS/WAN works.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Note that the UNROLL option makes the 'inner' des loop unroll all 16 rounds
instead of the default 4.
RISC1 and RISC2 are 2 alternatives for the inner loop and
PTR means to use pointers arithmatic instead of arrays.

Notes.
[1] For the ultra sparc, SunC 4.0 cc -fast -Xa -xO5, running 'des_opts'
    gives a speed of 475,000 des/s while 'speed' gives 417,000 des/s.
    I belive the difference is tied up in optimisation that the compiler
    is able to perform when the code is 'inlined'.  For 'speed', the DES
    routines are being linked from a library.  I'll record the higher
    speed since if performance is everything, you can always inline
    'des_enc.c'.
[2] Similar to the ultra sparc ([1]), 181,000 for 'des_opts' vs 175,000.
[3] I was unable to get access to this machine when it was not heavily loaded.
    As such, my timing program was never able to get more that %30 of the CPU.
    This would cause the program to give much lower speed numbers because
    it would be 'fighting' to stay in the cache with the other CPU burning
    processes.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

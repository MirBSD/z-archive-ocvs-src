@Note that the UNROLL option makes the 'inner' des loop unroll all 16 rounds
instead of the default 4.
RISC1 and RISC2 are 2 alternatives for the inner loop and
PTR means to use pointers arithmatic instead of arrays.

Notes.
[1] For the ultra sparc, SunC 4.0 
    cc -xtarget=ultra -xarch=v8plus -Xa -xO5, running 'des_opts'
    gives a speed of 344,000 des/s while 'speed' gives 459,000 des/s.
    I'll record the higher since it is coming from the library but it
    is all rather weird.
[2] Similar to the ultra sparc ([1]), 181,000 for 'des_opts' vs 175,000.
[3] I was unable to get access to this machine when it was not heavily loaded.
    As such, my timing program was never able to get more that %30 of the CPU.
    This would cause the program to give much lower speed numbers because
    it would be 'fighting' to stay in the cache with the other CPU burning
    processes.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

/*
 * Query the EGD <URL: http://www.lothar.com/tech/crypto/>.
 *
 * This module supplies three routines:
 *
 * RAND_query_egd_bytes(path, buf, bytes)
 *   will actually query "bytes" bytes of entropy form the egd-socket located
 *   at path and will write them to buf (if supplied) or will directly feed
 *   it to RAND_seed() if buf==NULL.
 *   The number of bytes is not limited by the maximum chunk size of EGD,
 *   which is 255 bytes. If more than 255 bytes are wanted, several chunks
 *   of entropy bytes are requested. The connection is left open until the
 *   query is competed.
 *   RAND_query_egd_bytes() returns with
 *     -1  if an error occured during connection or communication.
 *     num the number of bytes read from the EGD socket. This number is either
 *         the number of bytes requested or smaller, if the EGD pool is
 *         drained and the daemon signals that the pool is empty.
 *   This routine does not touch any RAND_status(). This is necessary, since
 *   PRNG functions may call it during initialization.
 *
 * RAND_egd_bytes(path, bytes) will query "bytes" bytes and have them
 *   used to seed the PRNG.
 *   RAND_egd_bytes() is a wrapper for RAND_query_egd_bytes() with buf=NULL.
 *   Unlike RAND_query_egd_bytes(), RAND_status() is used to test the
 *   seed status so that the return value can reflect the seed state:
 *     -1  if an error occured during connection or communication _or_
 *         if the PRNG has still not received the required seeding.
 *     num the number of bytes read from the EGD socket. This number is either
 *         the number of bytes requested or smaller, if the EGD pool is
 *         drained and the daemon signals that the pool is empty.
 *
 * RAND_egd(path) will query 255 bytes and use the bytes retreived to seed
 *   the PRNG.
 *   RAND_egd() is a wrapper for RAND_egd_bytes() with numbytes=255.

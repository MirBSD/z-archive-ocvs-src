/* X509_REQ_INFO is handled in an unusual way to get round

 * violation of PKCS#10 but we need to tolerate it. We do
 * this by making the attributes field OPTIONAL then using
 * the callback to initialise it to an empty STACK. 
 *
 * This means that the field will be correctly encoded unless
 * we NULL out the field.
 *
 * As a result we no longer need the req_kludge field because
 * the information is now contained in the attributes field:
 * 1. If it is NULL then it's the invalid omission.
 * 2. If it is empty it is the correct encoding.
 * 3. If it is not empty then some attributes are present.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@fix all these damned format string errors in libcrypto
some of these *DO BREAK* libcrypto on *ALL* LP64 archs
(alpha, sparc64, amd64 - to name just a few)
and OpenBSD hasn't noticed these...

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

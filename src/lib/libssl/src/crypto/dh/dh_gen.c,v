/* We generate DH parameters as follows

 * For this case, g is a generator if
 * g^((p-1)/q) mod p != 1 for values of q which are the factors of p-1.
 * Since the factors of p-1 are q and 2, we just need to check
 * g^2 mod p != 1 and g^q mod p != 1.
 *
 * Having said all that,
 * there is another special case method for the generators 2, 3 and 5.
 * for 2, p mod 24 == 11
 * for 3, p mod 12 == 5  <<<<< does not work for safe primes.
 * for 5, p mod 10 == 3 or 7
 *
 * Thanks to Phil Karn <karn@@qualcomm.com> for the pointers about the
 * special generators and for answering some of my questions.
 *
 * I've implemented the second simple method :-).
 * Since DH should be using a safe prime (both p and q are prime),
 * this generator function can take a very very long time to run.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

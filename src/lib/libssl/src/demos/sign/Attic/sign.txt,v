hmm... a rather poorly documented are of the library at this point in time.

What you should do is 
	X509 *x509=PEM_read_X509(fp,NULL,NULL);
	/* which is the same as PEM_ASN1_read(d2i_X509,PEM_STRING_X509,fp,
	 * NULL,NULL); */
Then
	EVP_PKEY *pkey=X509_extract_key(x509);

There is also a X509_REQ_extract_key(req);
which gets the public key from a certificate request.

I re-worked quite a bit of this when I cleaned up the dependancy on
RSA as the private key.

:-), PEM_STRING_EVP_PKEY is 'magical' :-).  In theory I should be using a
standard such as PKCS#8 to store the private key so that the type is 
encoded in the asn.1 encoding of the object.

The actual public key is kept in the certificate, so basically you have 
to load the certificate and then 'unpack' the public key from the 
certificate.

:-) After SSLv3 and PKCS#7 :-).  I actually started doing a function list 
but what I really need to do is do quite a few 'this is how you do xyz' 
type documents.  I suppose the current method is to post to ssl-users and 
I'll respond :-).

I'll add a 'demo' directory for the next release, I've appended a 
modified version of your program that works, you were very close :-).

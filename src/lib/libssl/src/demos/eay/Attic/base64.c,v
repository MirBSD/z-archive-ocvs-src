@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

=head1 NAME

SHA1, SHA1_Init, SHA1_Update, SHA1_Final - Secure Hash Algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/sha.h>

 unsigned char *SHA1(const unsigned char *d, unsigned long n,
                  unsigned char *md);

 void SHA1_Init(SHA_CTX *c);
 void SHA1_Update(SHA_CTX *c, const void *data,
                  unsigned long len);
 void SHA1_Final(unsigned char *md, SHA_CTX *c);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function with a
160 bit output.

SHA1() computes the SHA-1 message digest of the B<n>
bytes at B<d> and places it in B<md> (which must have space for
SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output). If B<md> is NULL, the digest
is placed in a static array.

The following functions may be used if the message is not completely
stored in memory:

SHA1_Init() initializes a B<SHA_CTX> structure.

SHA1_Update() can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to
be hashed (B<len> bytes at B<data>).

SHA1_Final() places the message digest in B<md>, which must have space
for SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH == 20 bytes of output, and erases the B<SHA_CTX>.

Applications should use the higher level functions
L<EVP_DigestInit(3)|EVP_DigestInit(3)>
etc. instead of calling the hash functions directly.

The predecessor of SHA-1, SHA, is also implemented, but it should be
used only when backward compatibility is required.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SHA1() returns a pointer to the hash value. 

SHA1_Init(), SHA1_Update() and SHA1_Final() do not return values.

=head1 CONFORMING TO

SHA: US Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS PUB 180 (Secure Hash
Standard),
SHA-1: US Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS PUB 180-1 (Secure Hash
Standard),
ANSI X9.30

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<RIPEMD160(3)|RIPEMD160(3)>, L<HMAC(3)|HMAC(3)>, L<EVP_DigestInit(3)|EVP_DigestInit(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

SHA1(), SHA1_Init(), SHA1_Update() and SHA1_Final() are available in all
versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

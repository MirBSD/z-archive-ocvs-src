=head1 NAME

 EVP_BytesToKey - password based encryption routine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 int EVP_BytesToKey(const EVP_CIPHER *type,const EVP_MD *md,
                       const unsigned char *salt,
                       const unsigned char *data, int datal, int count,
                       unsigned char *key,unsigned char *iv);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_BytesToKey() derives a key and IV from various parameters. B<type> is
the cipher to derive the key and IV for. B<md> is the message digest to use.
The B<salt> paramter is used as a salt in the derivation: it should point to
an 8 byte buffer or NULL if no salt is used. B<data> is a buffer containing
B<datal> bytes which is used to derive the keying data. B<count> is the
iteration count to use. The derived key and IV will be written to B<key>
and B<iv> respectively.

=head1 NOTES

A typical application of this function is to derive keying material for an
encryption algorithm from a password in the B<data> parameter.

Increasing the B<count> parameter slows down the algorithm which makes it
harder for an attacker to peform a brute force attack using a large number
of candidate passwords.

If the total key and IV length is less than the digest length and
B<MD5> is used then the derivation algorithm is compatible with PKCS#5 v1.5
otherwise a non standard extension is used to derive the extra data.

Newer applications should use more standard algorithms such as PKCS#5
v2.0 for key derivation.

=head1 KEY DERIVATION ALGORITHM

The key and IV is derived by concatenating D_1, D_2, etc until
enough data is available for the key and IV. D_i is defined as:

	D_i = HASH^count(D_(i-1) || data || salt)

where || denotes concatentaion, D_0 is empty, HASH is the digest
algorithm in use, HASH^1(data) is simply HASH(data), HASH^2(data)
is HASH(HASH(data)) and so on.

The initial bytes are used for the key and the subsequent bytes for
the IV.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_BytesToKey() returns the size of the derived key in bytes.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

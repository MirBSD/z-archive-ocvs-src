=head1 NAME

BIO_s_socket, BIO_new_socket - socket BIO

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/bio.h>

 BIO_METHOD *BIO_s_socket(void);

 long BIO_set_fd(BIO *b, int fd, long close_flag);
 long BIO_get_fd(BIO *b, int *c);

 BIO *BIO_new_socket(int sock, int close_flag);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BIO_s_socket() returns the socket BIO method. This is a wrapper
round the platform's socket routines.

BIO_read() and BIO_write() read or write the underlying socket.
BIO_puts() is supported but BIO_gets() is not.

If the close flag is set then the socket is shut down and closed
when the BIO is freed.

BIO_set_fd() sets the socket of BIO B<b> to B<fd> and the close
flag to B<close_flag>.

BIO_get_fd() places the socket in B<c> if it is not NULL, it also
returns the socket. If B<c> is not NULL it should be of type (int *).

BIO_new_socket() returns a socket BIO using B<sock> and B<close_flag>.

=head1 NOTES

Socket BIOs also support any relevant functionality of file descriptor
BIOs.

The reason for having separate file descriptor and socket BIOs is that on some
platforms sockets are not file descriptors and use distinct I/O routines,
Windows is one such platform. Any code mixing the two will not work on
all platforms.

BIO_set_fd() and BIO_get_fd() are macros.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

BIO_s_socket() returns the socket BIO method.

BIO_set_fd() always returns 1.

BIO_get_fd() returns the socket or -1 if the BIO has not been
initialized.

BIO_new_socket() returns the newly allocated BIO or NULL is an error
occurred.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

=head1 NAME

CRYPTO_set_ex_data, CRYPTO_get_ex_data - internal application specific data functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 int CRYPTO_set_ex_data(CRYPTO_EX_DATA *r, int idx, void *arg);

 void *CRYPTO_get_ex_data(CRYPTO_EX_DATA *r, int idx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Several OpenSSL structures can have application specific data attached to them.
These functions are used internally by OpenSSL to manipulate application
specific data attached to a specific structure.

These functions should only be used by applications to manipulate
B<CRYPTO_EX_DATA> structures passed to the B<new_func()>, B<free_func()> and
B<dup_func()> callbacks: as passed to B<RSA_get_ex_new_index()> for example.

B<CRYPTO_set_ex_data()> is used to set application specific data, the data is
supplied in the B<arg> parameter and its precise meaning is up to the
application.

B<CRYPTO_get_ex_data()> is used to retrieve application specific data. The data
is returned to the application, this will be the same value as supplied to
a previous B<CRYPTO_set_ex_data()> call.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

B<CRYPTO_set_ex_data()> returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.

B<CRYPTO_get_ex_data()> returns the application data or 0 on failure. 0 may also
be valid application data but currently it can only fail if given an invalid B<idx>
parameter.

On failure an error code can be obtained from L<ERR_get_error(3)|ERR_get_error(3)>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<RSA_get_ex_new_index(3)|RSA_get_ex_new_index(3)>,
L<DSA_get_ex_new_index(3)|DSA_get_ex_new_index(3)>,
L<DH_get_ex_new_index(3)|DH_get_ex_new_index(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

CRYPTO_set_ex_data() and CRYPTO_get_ex_data() have been available since SSLeay 0.9.0.

log
@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

=head1 NAME

nseq - create or examine a netscape certificate sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<nseq>
[B<-in filename>]
[B<-out filename>]
[B<-toseq>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<nseq> command takes a file containing a Netscape certificate
sequence and prints out the certificates contained in it or takes a
file of certificates and converts it into a Netscape certificate
sequence.

=head1 COMMAND OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-in filename>

This specifies the input filename to read or standard input if this
option is not specified.

=item B<-out filename>

specifies the output filename or standard output by default.

=item B<-toseq>

normally a Netscape certificate sequence will be input and the output
is the certificates contained in it. With the B<-toseq> option the
situation is reversed: a Netscape certificate sequence is created from
a file of certificates.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Output the certificates in a Netscape certificate sequence

 openssl nseq -in nseq.pem -out certs.pem

Create a Netscape certificate sequence

 openssl nseq -in certs.pem -toseq -out nseq.pem

=head1 NOTES

The B<PEM> encoded form uses the same headers and footers as a certificate:

 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----

A Netscape certificate sequence is a Netscape specific form that can be sent
to browsers as an alternative to the standard PKCS#7 format when several
certificates are sent to the browser: for example during certificate enrollment.
It is used by Netscape certificate server for example.

=head1 BUGS

This program needs a few more options: like allowing DER or PEM input and
output files and allowing multiple certificate files to be used.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_mode, SSL_set_mode, SSL_CTX_get_mode, SSL_get_mode - manipulate SSL engine mode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 long SSL_CTX_set_mode(SSL_CTX *ctx, long mode);
 long SSL_set_mode(SSL *ssl, long mode);

 long SSL_CTX_get_mode(SSL_CTX *ctx);
 long SSL_get_mode(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_mode() adds the mode set via bitmask in B<mode> to B<ctx>.
Options already set before are not cleared.

SSL_set_mode() adds the mode set via bitmask in B<mode> to B<ssl>.
Options already set before are not cleared.

SSL_CTX_get_mode() returns the mode set for B<ctx>.

SSL_get_mode() returns the mode set for B<ssl>.

=head1 NOTES

The following mode changes are available:

=over 4

=item SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE

Allow SSL_write(..., n) to return r with 0 < r < n (i.e. report success
when just a single record has been written). When not set (the default),
SSL_write() will only report success once the complete chunk was written.
Once SSL_write() returns with r, r bytes have been successfully written
and the next call to SSL_write() must only send the n-r bytes left,
imitating the behaviour of write().

=item SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER

Make it possible to retry SSL_write() with changed buffer location
(the buffer contents must stay the same). This is not the default to avoid
the misconception that non-blocking SSL_write() behaves like
non-blocking write().

=item SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY

Never bother the application with retries if the transport is blocking.
If a renegotiation take place during normal operation, a
L<SSL_read(3)|SSL_read(3)> or L<SSL_write(3)|SSL_write(3)> would return
with -1 and indicate the need to retry with SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ.
In a non-blocking environment applications must be prepared to handle
incomplete read/write operations.
In a blocking environment, applications are not always prepared to
deal with read/write operations returning without success report. The
flag SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY will cause read/write operations to only
return after the handshake and successful completion.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_mode() and SSL_set_mode() return the new mode bitmask
after adding B<mode>.

SSL_CTX_get_mode() and SSL_get_mode() return the current bitmask.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<ssl(3)|ssl(3)>, L<SSL_read(3)|SSL_read(3)>, L<SSL_write(3)|SSL_write(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY as been added in OpenSSL 0.9.6.

1.1.3.1
log
@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

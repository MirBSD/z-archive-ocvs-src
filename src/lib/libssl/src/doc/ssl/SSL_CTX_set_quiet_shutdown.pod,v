=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown, SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown, SSL_set_quiet_shutdown, SSL_get_quiet_shutdown - manipulate shutdown behaviour

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 void SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown(SSL_CTX *ctx, int mode);
 int SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown(SSL_CTX *ctx);

 void SSL_set_quiet_shutdown(SSL *ssl, int mode);
 int SSL_get_quiet_shutdown(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag for B<ctx> to be
B<mode>. SSL objects created from B<ctx> inherit the B<mode> valid at the time
L<SSL_new(3)|SSL_new(3)> is called. B<mode> may be 0 or 1.

SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of B<ctx>.

SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag for B<ssl> to be
B<mode>. The setting stays valid until B<ssl> is removed with
L<SSL_free(3)|SSL_free(3)> or SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() is called again.
It is not changed when L<SSL_clear(3)|SSL_clear(3)> is called.
B<mode> may be 0 or 1.

SSL_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of B<ssl>.

=head1 NOTES

Normally when a SSL connection is finished, the parties must send out
"close notify" alert messages using L<SSL_shutdown(3)|SSL_shutdown(3)>
for a clean shutdown.

When setting the "quiet shutdown" flag to 1, L<SSL_shutdown(3)|SSL_shutdown(3)>
will set the internal flags to SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.
(L<SSL_shutdown(3)|SSL_shutdown(3)> then behaves like
L<SSL_set_shutdown(3)|SSL_set_shutdown(3)> called with
SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.)
The session is thus considered to be shutdown, but no "close notify" alert
is sent to the peer. This behaviour violates the TLS standard.

The default is normal shutdown behaviour as described by the TLS standard.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() and SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() do not return
diagnostic information.

SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() and SSL_get_quiet_shutdown return the current
setting.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

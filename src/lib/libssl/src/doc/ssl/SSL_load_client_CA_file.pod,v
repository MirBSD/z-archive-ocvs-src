=head1 NAME

SSL_load_client_CA_file - load certificate names from file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *SSL_load_client_CA_file(const char *file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_load_client_CA_file() reads certificates from B<file> and returns
a STACK_OF(X509_NAME) with the subject names found.

=head1 NOTES

SSL_load_client_CA_file() reads a file of PEM formatted certificates and
extracts the X509_NAMES of the certificates found. While the name suggests
the specific usage as support function for
L<SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3)|SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3)>,
it is not limited to CA certificates.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Load names of CAs from file and use it as a client CA list:

 SSL_CTX *ctx;
 STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *cert_names;

 ... 
 cert_names = SSL_load_client_CA_file("/path/to/CAfile.pem");
 if (cert_names != NULL)
   SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx, cert_names);
 else
   error_handling();
 ...

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item NULL

The operation failed, check out the error stack for the reason.

=item Pointer to STACK_OF(X509_NAME)

Pointer to the subject names of the successfully read certificates.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<ssl(3)|ssl(3)>,
L<SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3)|SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3)>

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

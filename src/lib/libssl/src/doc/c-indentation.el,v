log
@Initial revision
@
text
@; This Emacs Lisp file defines a C indentation style that closely
; follows most aspects of the one that is used throughout SSLeay,
; and hence in OpenSSL.
; 
; This definition is for the "CC mode" package, which is the default
; mode for editing C source files in Emacs 20, not for the older
; c-mode.el (which was the default in less recent releaes of Emacs 19).
;
; Copy the definition in your .emacs file or use M-x eval-buffer.
; To activate this indentation style, visit a C file, type
; M-x c-set-style <RET> (or C-c . for short), and enter "eay".
; To toggle the auto-newline feature of CC mode, type C-c C-a.
;
; Apparently statement blocks that are not introduced by a statement
; such as "if" and that are not the body of a function cannot
; be handled too well by CC mode with this indentation style.
; The style defined below does not indent them at all.
; To insert tabs manually, prefix them with ^Q (the "quoted-insert"
; command of Emacs).  If you know a solution to this problem
; or find other problems with this indentation style definition,
; please send e-mail to bodo@@openssl.org.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

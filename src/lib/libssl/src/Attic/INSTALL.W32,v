 INSTALLATION ON THE WIN32 PLATFORM
 ----------------------------------

 Heres a few comments about building OpenSSL in Windows environments.  Most
 of this is tested on Win32 but it may also work in Win 3.1 with some
 modification.

 You need Perl for Win32.  Unless you will build on Cygwin, you will need
 ActiveState Perl, available from http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl.
 For Cygwin users, there's more info in the Cygwin section.

 and one of the following C compilers:

  * Visual C++
  * Borland C
  * GNU C (Mingw32 or Cygwin)

 If you want to compile in the assembly language routines with Visual C++ then
 you will need an assembler. This is worth doing because it will result in
 faster code: for example it will typically result in a 2 times speedup in the
 RSA routines. Currently the following assemblers are supported:

  * Microsoft MASM (aka "ml")
  * Free Netwide Assembler NASM.

 MASM was at one point distributed with VC++. It is now distributed with some
 Microsoft DDKs, for example the Windows NT 4.0 DDK and the Windows 98 DDK. If
 you do not have either of these DDKs then you can just download the binaries
 for the Windows 98 DDK and extract and rename the two files XXXXXml.exe and
 XXXXXml.err, to ml.exe and ml.err and install somewhere on your PATH. Both
 DDKs can be downloaded from the Microsoft developers site www.msdn.com.

 NASM is freely available. Version 0.98 was used during testing: other versions
 may also work. It is available from many places, see for example:
 http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm/binaries/win32/
 The NASM binary nasmw.exe needs to be installed anywhere on your PATH.

 If you are compiling from a tarball or a CVS snapshot then the Win32 files
 may well be not up to date. This may mean that some "tweaking" is required to
 get it all to work. See the trouble shooting section later on for if (when?)
 it goes wrong.

 Visual C++
 ----------

 Firstly you should run Configure:

 > perl Configure VC-WIN32

 Next you need to build the Makefiles and optionally the assembly language
 files:

 - If you are using MASM then run:

   > ms\do_masm

 - If you are using NASM then run:

   > ms\do_nasm

 - If you don't want to use the assembly language files at all then run:

   > ms\do_ms

 If you get errors about things not having numbers assigned then check the
 troubleshooting section: you probably won't be able to compile it as it
 stands.

 Then from the VC++ environment at a prompt do:

 > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak

 If all is well it should compile and you will have some DLLs and executables
 in out32dll. If you want to try the tests then do:
 
 > cd out32dll
 > ..\ms\test

 Tweaks:

 There are various changes you can make to the Win32 compile environment. By
 default the library is not compiled with debugging symbols. If you add 'debug'
 to the mk1mf.pl lines in the do_* batch file then debugging symbols will be
 compiled in.

 The default Win32 environment is to leave out any Windows NT specific
 features.

 If you want to enable the NT specific features of OpenSSL (currently only the
 logging BIO) follow the instructions above but call the batch file do_nt.bat
 instead of do_ms.bat.

 You can also build a static version of the library using the Makefile
 ms\nt.mak

 Borland C++ builder 5
 ---------------------

 * Configure for building with Borland Builder:
   > perl Configure BC-32

 * Create the appropriate makefile
   > ms\do_nasm

 * Build
   > make -f ms\bcb.mak

 Borland C++ builder 3 and 4
 ---------------------------

 * Setup PATH. First must be GNU make then bcb4/bin 

 * Run ms\bcb4.bat

 * Run make:
   > make -f bcb.mak

 GNU C (Mingw32)
 ---------------

 To build OpenSSL, you need the Mingw32 package and GNU make.

 * Compiler installation:

   Mingw32 is available from <ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/
   gnu-win32/mingw32/gcc-2.95.2/gcc-2.95.2-msvcrt.exe>. Extract it
   to a directory such as C:\gcc-2.95.2 and add c:\gcc-2.95.2\bin to
   the PATH environment variable in "System Properties"; or edit and
   run C:\gcc-2.95.2\mingw32.bat to set the PATH.

 * Compile OpenSSL:

   > ms\mingw32

   This will create the library and binaries in out. In case any problems
   occur, try
   > ms\mingw32 no-asm
   instead.

   libcrypto.a and libssl.a are the static libraries. To use the DLLs,
   link with libeay32.a and libssl32.a instead.

   See troubleshooting if you get error messages about functions not having
   a number assigned.

 * You can now try the tests:

   > cd out
   > ..\ms\test

 GNU C (Cygwin)
 --------------

 Cygwin provides a bash shell and GNU tools environment running
 on NT 4.0, Windows 9x, Windows ME, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.
 Consequently, a make of OpenSSL with Cygwin is closer to a GNU
 bash environment such as Linux than to other W32 makes which are
 based on a single makefile approach. Cygwin implements Posix/Unix
 calls through cygwin1.dll, and is contrasted to Mingw32 which links
 dynamically to msvcrt.dll or crtdll.dll.

 To build OpenSSL using Cygwin:

 * Install Cygwin (see http://cygwin.com/)

 * Install Perl and ensure it is in the path (recent Cygwin perl 
   (version 5.6.1-2 of the latter has been reported to work) or
   ActivePerl)

 * Run the Cygwin bash shell

 * $ tar zxvf openssl-x.x.x.tar.gz
   $ cd openssl-x.x.x
   $ ./config
   [...]
   $ make
   [...]
   $ make test
   $ make install

 This will create a default install in /usr/local/ssl.

 Cygwin Notes:

 "make test" and normal file operations may fail in directories
 mounted as text (i.e. mount -t c:\somewhere /home) due to Cygwin
 stripping of carriage returns. To avoid this ensure that a binary
 mount is used, e.g. mount -b c:\somewhere /home.

 "bc" is not provided in older Cygwin distribution.  This causes a
 non-fatal error in "make test" but is otherwise harmless.  If
 desired and needed, GNU bc can be built with Cygwin without change.


 Installation
 ------------

 If you used the Cygwin procedure above, you have already installed and
 can skip this section.  For all other procedures, there's currently no real
 installation procedure for Win32.  There are, however, some suggestions:

    - do nothing.  The include files are found in the inc32/ subdirectory,
      all binaries are found in out32dll/ or out32/ depending if you built
      dynamic or static libraries.

    - do as is written in INSTALL.Win32 that comes with modssl:

	$ md c:\openssl 
	$ md c:\openssl\bin
	$ md c:\openssl\lib
	$ md c:\openssl\include
	$ md c:\openssl\include\openssl
	$ copy /b inc32\*               c:\openssl\include\openssl
	$ copy /b out32dll\ssleay32.lib c:\openssl\lib
	$ copy /b out32dll\libeay32.lib c:\openssl\lib
	$ copy /b out32dll\ssleay32.dll c:\openssl\bin
	$ copy /b out32dll\libeay32.dll c:\openssl\bin
	$ copy /b out32dll\openssl.exe  c:\openssl\bin

      Of course, you can choose another device than c:.  C: is used here
      because that's usually the first (and often only) harddisk device.
      Note: in the modssl INSTALL.Win32, p: is used rather than c:.


 Troubleshooting
 ---------------

 Since the Win32 build is only occasionally tested it may not always compile
 cleanly.  If you get an error about functions not having numbers assigned
 when you run ms\do_ms then this means the Win32 ordinal files are not up to
 date. You can do:

 > perl util\mkdef.pl crypto ssl update

 then ms\do_XXX should not give a warning any more. However the numbers that
 get assigned by this technique may not match those that eventually get
 assigned in the CVS tree: so anything linked against this version of the
 library may need to be recompiled.

 If you get errors about unresolved symbols there are several possible
 causes.

 If this happens when the DLL is being linked and you have disabled some
 ciphers then it is possible the DEF file generator hasn't removed all
 the disabled symbols: the easiest solution is to edit the DEF files manually
 to delete them. The DEF files are ms\libeay32.def ms\ssleay32.def.

 Another cause is if you missed or ignored the errors about missing numbers
 mentioned above.

 If you get warnings in the code then the compilation will halt.

 The default Makefile for Win32 halts whenever any warnings occur. Since VC++
 has its own ideas about warnings which don't always match up to other
 environments this can happen. The best fix is to edit the file with the
 warning in and fix it. Alternatively you can turn off the halt on warnings by
 editing the CFLAG line in the Makefile and deleting the /WX option.

 You might get compilation errors. Again you will have to fix these or report
 them.

 One final comment about compiling applications linked to the OpenSSL library.
 If you don't use the multithreaded DLL runtime library (/MD option) your
 program will almost certainly crash because malloc gets confused -- the
 OpenSSL DLLs are statically linked to one version, the application must
 not use a different one.  You might be able to work around such problems
 by adding CRYPTO_malloc_init() to your program before any calls to the
 OpenSSL libraries: This tells the OpenSSL libraries to use the same
 malloc(), free() and realloc() as the application.  However there are many
 standard library functions used by OpenSSL that call malloc() internally
 (e.g. fopen()), and OpenSSL cannot change these; so in general you cannot
 rely on CRYPTO_malloc_init() solving your problem, and you should
 consistently use the multithreaded library.

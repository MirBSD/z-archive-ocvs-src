#
# Run this script from the OpenSSL root directory:
# sh shlib/hpux10-cc.sh
# 
# HP-UX (10.20) shared library installation:
# Compile and install OpenSSL with best possible optimization:
# - shared libraries are compiled and installed with +O4 optimization
# - executable(s) are compiled and installed with +O4 optimization
# - static libraries are compiled and installed with +O3 optimization,
#   to avoid the time consuming +O4 link-time optimization when using
#   these libraries. (The shared libs are already optimized during build
#   at +O4.)
#
# This script must be run with appropriate privileges to install into
# /usr/local/ssl. HP-UX prevents used executables and shared libraries
# from being deleted or overwritten. Stop all processes using already
# installed items of OpenSSL.
#
# WARNING: At high optimization levels, HP's ANSI-C compiler can chew up
#          large amounts of memory and CPU time. Make sure to have at least
#          128MB of RAM available and that your kernel is configured to allow
#          at least 128MB data size (maxdsiz parameter which can be obtained
#          by multiplying 'echo maxdsiz/D | adb -k /stand/vmunix /dev/kmem'
#          by 'getconf PAGE_SIZE').
#          The installation process can take several hours, even on fast
#          machines. +O4 optimization of the libcrypto.sl shared library may
#          take 1 hour on a C200 (200MHz PA8200 CPU), +O3 compilation of
#          fcrypt_b.c can take 20 minutes on this machine. Stay patient.
#
# SITEFLAGS: site specific flags. I do use +DAportable, since I have to
# support older PA1.1-type CPUs. Your mileage may vary.
# +w1 enables enhanced warnings, useful when working with snaphots.
#
SITEFLAGS="+DAportable +w1"
#
# Set the default additions to build with HP-UX.

# Configure directly.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

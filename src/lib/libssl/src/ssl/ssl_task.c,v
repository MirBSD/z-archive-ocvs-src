/*
 * DECnet object for servicing SSL.  We accept the inbound and speak a
 * simple protocol for multiplexing the 2 data streams (application and
 * ssl data) over this logical link.
 *
 * Logical names:
 *    SSL_CIPHER	Defines a list of cipher specifications the server
 *			will support in order of preference.
 *    SSL_SERVER_CERTIFICATE
 *			Points to PEM (privacy enhanced mail) file that
 *			contains the server certificate and private password.
 *    SYS$NET		Logical created by netserver.exe as hook for completing
 *			DECnet logical link.
 *
 * Each NSP message sent over the DECnet link has the following structure:
 *    struct rpc_msg { 
 *      char channel;
 *      char function;
 *      short length;
 *      char data[MAX_DATA];
 *    } msg;
 *
 * The channel field designates the virtual data stream this message applies
 * to and is one of:
 *   A - Application data (payload).
 *   R - Remote client connection that initiated the SSL connection.  Encrypted
 *       data is sent over this connection.
 *   G - General data, reserved for future use.
 *
 * The data streams are half-duplex read/write and have following functions:
 *   G - Get, requests that up to msg.length bytes of data be returned.  The
 *       data is returned in the next 'C' function response that matches the
 *       requesting channel.
 *   P - Put, requests that the first msg.length bytes of msg.data be appended
 *       to the designated stream.
 *   C - Confirms a get or put.  Every get and put will get a confirm response,
 *       you cannot initiate another function on a channel until the previous
 *       operation has been confirmed.
 *
 *  The 2 channels may interleave their operations, for example:
 *        Server msg           Client msg
 *         A, Get, 4092          ---->
 *                               <----  R, get, 4092
 *         R, Confirm, {hello}   ---->
 *                               <----  R, put, {srv hello}
 *         R, Confirm, 0         ---->
 *                               .		(SSL handshake completed)
 *                               .              (read first app data).
 *                               <----  A, confirm, {http data}
 *         A, Put, {http data}   ---->
 *                               <----  A, confirm, 0
 *
 *  The length field is not permitted to be larger that 4092 bytes.

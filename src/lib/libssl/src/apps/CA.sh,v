#
# CA - wrapper around ca to make it easier to use ... basically ca requires
#      some setup stuff to be done before you can use it and this makes
#      things easier between now and when Eric is convinced to fix it :-)
#
# CA -newca ... will setup the right stuff
# CA -newreq ... will generate a certificate request 
# CA -sign ... will sign the generated request and output 
#
# At the end of that grab newreq.pem and newcert.pem (one has the key 
# and the other the certificate) and cat them together and that is what
# you want/need ... I'll make even this a little cleaner later.
#
#
# 12-Jan-96 tjh    Added more things ... including CA -signcert which
#                  converts a certificate to a request and then signs it.
# 10-Jan-96 eay    Fixed a few more bugs and added the SSLEAY_CONFIG
#		   environment variable so this can be driven from
#		   a script.
# 25-Jul-96 eay    Cleaned up filenames some more.
# 11-Jun-96 eay    Fixed a few filename missmatches.
# 03-May-96 eay    Modified to use 'ssleay cmd' instead of 'cmd'.
# 18-Apr-96 tjh    Original hacking

log
@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

#include <stdio.h>

/* There is a bug in
 * gcc version 2.5.8 (88open OCS/BCS, DG-2.5.8.3, Oct 14 1994)
 * as shipped with DGUX 5.4R3.10 that can be bypassed by defining
 * DG_GCC_BUG in my code.
 * The bug manifests itself by the vaule of a pointer that is
 * used only by reference, not having it's value change when it is used
 * to check for exiting the loop.  Probably caused by there being 2
 * copies of the valiable, one in a register and one being an address
 * that is passed. */

/* compare the out put from
 * gcc dggccbug.c; ./a.out
 * and
 * gcc -O dggccbug.c; ./a.out
 * compile with -DFIXBUG to remove the bug when optimising.

@for the damned sixth time: try to import (stock) OpenSSL 0.9.7b (on which
the OpenBSD-openssl and our libcrypto and libssl are based) into a vendor
branch in order to schedule an update to OpenSSL.

CVS hates me today.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

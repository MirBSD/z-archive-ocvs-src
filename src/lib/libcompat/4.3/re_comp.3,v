.Dt RE_COMP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm re_comp ,
.Nm re_exec
.Nd regular expression handler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn re_comp "const char *s"
.Ft int
.Fn re_exec "const char *s"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by
.Xr regex 3 .
It is available from the compatibility library, libcompat.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn re_comp
function
compiles a string into an internal form suitable for pattern matching.
The
.Fn re_exec
function
checks the argument string against the last string passed to
.Fn re_comp .
.Pp
The
.Fn re_comp
function
returns 0 if the string
.Fa s
was compiled successfully; otherwise a string containing an
error message is returned.
If
.Fn re_comp
is passed 0 or a null string, it returns without changing the currently
compiled regular expression.
.Pp
The
.Fn re_exec
function
returns 1 if the string
.Fa s
matches the last compiled regular expression, 0 if the string
.Fa s
failed to match the last compiled regular expression, and \-1 if the compiled
regular expression was invalid (indicating an internal error).
.Pp
The strings passed to both
.Fn re_comp
and
.Fn re_exec
may have trailing or embedded newline characters;
they are terminated by
.Dv NUL Ns s.
The regular expressions recognized are described in the manual entry for
.Xr ed 1 ,
given the above difference.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Fn re_exec
function
returns \-1 for an internal error.
.Pp
The
.Fn re_comp
function
returns one of the following strings if an error occurs:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
No previous regular expression,
Regular expression too long,
unmatched \e(,
missing ],
too many \e(\e) pairs,
unmatched \e).

.Xr ex 1 ,
.Xr fgrep 1 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn re_comp
and
.Fn re_exec
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

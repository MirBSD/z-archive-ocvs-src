.Sh NAME
.Nm login ,
.Nm logout ,
.Nm logwtmp
.Nd login utility functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <utmp.h>
.Fd #include <util.h>
.Ft void
.Fn login "struct utmp *ut"
.Ft int
.Fn logout "const char *line"
.Ft void
.Fn logwtmp "const char *line" "const char *name" "const char *host"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn login ,
.Fn logout ,
and
.Fn logwtmp
functions operate on the database of current users in
.Pa /var/run/utmp
and on the logfile
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
of logins and logouts.
.Pp
The
.Fn login
function updates the
.Pa /var/run/utmp
and
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
files with user information contained in
.Fa ut .
.Pp
The
.Fn logout
function removes the entry from
.Pa /var/run/utmp
corresponding to the device
.Fa line .
.Pp
The
.Fn logwtmp
function adds an entry to
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
Since
.Fn login
will add the appropriate entry for
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
during a login,
.Fn logwtmp
is usually used for logouts.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn logout
returns non-zero if it was able to find and delete an entry for
.Fa line ,
and zero if there is no entry for
.Fa line
in
.Pa /var/run/utmp .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

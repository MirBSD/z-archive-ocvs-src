.Dt PW_LOCK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pw_lock ,
.Nm pw_mkdb ,
.Nm pw_abort
.Nd passwd file update functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <util.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pw_lock "int retries"
.Ft int
.Fn pw_mkdb "char *username" "int pwflags"
.Ft void
.Fn pw_abort
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pw_lock ,
.Fn pw_mkdb ,
and
.Fn pw_abort
functions allow a program to update the system passwd database.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_lock
function attempts to lock the passwd database by creating the file
.Pa /etc/ptmp
with an exclusive lock (using
.Xr flock 2
semantics) and returns the file descriptor of that file.
If
.Fa retries
is greater than zero,
.Fn pw_lock
will try multiple times to open
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
waiting one second between tries.
In addition to being a lock file,
.Pa /etc/ptmp
will also hold the contents of the new passwd file.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function updates the passwd file from the contents of
.Pa /etc/ptmp
via
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 .
If a
.Fa username
is specified, only the record for the specified user will be updated.
The
.Fa pwflags
are specified by
.Tn OR Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _PASSWORD_SECUREONLY -offset "xxxx" -compact
.It Dv _PASSWORD_SECUREONLY
only update the secure database file
.Po Pa /etc/spwd.db Pc .
.It Dv _PASSWORD_OMITV7
do not update the Version 7 format password file
.Po Pa /etc/passwd Pc .
.El
.Pp
By default the secure, insecure and Version 7 format password databases
are updated.
You should finish writing to and close the file descriptor returned by
.Fn pw_lock
before calling
.Fn pw_mkdb .
If
.Fn pw_mkdb
fails and you do not wish to retry, you should make sure to call
.Fn pw_abort
to clean up the lock file.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_abort
function aborts a passwd file update by deleting
.Pa /etc/ptmp .
The passwd database remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pw_lock
and
.Fn pw_mkdb
functions return \-1 if they are unable to complete properly.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/master.passwd -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
current password file
.It Pa /etc/ptmp
password lock file
.It Pa /etc/passwd
a Version 7 format password file
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db
insecure password database file
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db
secure password database file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

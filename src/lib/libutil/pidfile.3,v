.Dt PIDFILE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pidfile
.Nd write a daemon pid file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <util.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pidfile "const char *basename"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn pidfile
writes a file containing the process ID of the program to the
.Pa /var/run
directory.
The file name has the form
.Pa /var/run/basename.pid .
If the
.Ar basename
argument is NULL,
.Nm
will determine the program name and use that instead.
.Pp
The pid file can be used as a quick reference if
the process needs to be sent a signal.
When the program exits, the pid file will be removed automatically,
unless the program receives a fatal signal.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn pidfile
returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atexit 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function call appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
If
.Fn pidfile
is called multiple times with different
.Ar basename ,
only the last pidfile will be removed upon exit.
.Pp
.Fn pidfile
uses
.Fn atexit
to ensure the pidfile is unlinked at program exit.
However, programs that use the
.Fn _exit
function (for example, in signal handlers)
will not trigger this behaviour.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

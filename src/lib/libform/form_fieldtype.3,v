.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBnew_fieldtype\fR creates a new field type usable for data
validation.  You supply it with \fIfield_check\fR, a predicate to check the
validity of an entered data string whenever the user attempt to leave a field.
The (FIELD *) argument is passed in so the validation predicate can see the
field's buffer, sizes and other attributes; the second argument is an
argument-block structure, about which more below.

You also supply \fBnew_fieldtype\fR with \fIchar_check\fR,
a function to validate input characters as they are entered; it will be passed
the character to be checked and a pointer to an argument-block structure.

The function \fBfree_fieldtype\fR frees the space allocated for a given
validation type.

The function \fBset_fieldtype\fR associates three storage-management functions
with a field type.  The \fImak_arg\fR function is automatically applied to the
list of arguments you give \fBset_field_type\fR when attaching validation
to a field; its job is to bundle these into an allocated argument-block
object which can later be passed to validation predicated.  The other two
hook arguments should copy and free argument-block structures.  They will
be used by the forms-driver code. You must supply the \fImak_arg\fR function,
the other two are optional, you may supply NULL for them. In this case it
is assumed, that \fImak_arg\fR doesn't allocate memory but simply loads the
argument into a single scalar value.

The form driver requests \fBREQ_NEXT_CHOICE\fR and \fBREQ_PREV_CHOICE\fR assume
that the possible values of a field form an ordered set, and provide the forms
user with a way to move through the set.  The \fBset_fieldtype_choice\fR
function allows forms programmers to define successor and predecessor functions
for the field type.  These functions take the field pointer and an
argument-block structure as arguments.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The pointer-valued routines return NULL on error.

The integer-valued routines return one of the following codes on
error:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
\fBE_CONNECTED\fR
The field is already connected to a form.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3), \fBform\fR(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.

All of the \fB(char *)\fR arguments of these functions should actually be
\fB(void *)\fR.  The type has been left uncorrected for strict compatibility
with System V.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

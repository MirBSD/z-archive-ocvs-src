.SH NAME
\fBform_field_buffer\fR - field buffer control
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int set_field_buffer(FIELD *field, int buf, const char *value);
.br
char *field_buffer(const FIELD *field, int buffer);
.br
int set_field_status(FIELD *field, bool status);
.br
bool field_status(const FIELD *field);
.br
int set_max_field(FIELD *field, int max);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_buffer\fR sets the numbered buffer of the given field
to contain a given string.  Buffer 0 is the displayed value of the field; other
numbered buffers may be allocated by applications through the \fBnbuf\fR
argument of (see \fBform_field_new\fR(3)) but are not manipulated by the forms
library.  The function \fBfield_buffer\fR returns the address of the buffer.
Please note that this buffer has always the length of the buffer, that means
that it may typically contain trailing spaces. If you entered leading spaces
the buffer may also contain them. If you want the raw data, you must write your
own routine that copies the value out of the buffer and removes the leading
and trailing spaces. Please note also, that subsequent operations on the form
will probably change the content of the buffer. So don't use it for long term
storage of the entered form data.

The function \fBset_field_status\fR sets the associated status flag of
\fIfield\fR; \fBfield_status\fR gets the current value.  The status flag
is set to a nonzero value whenever the field changes.

The function \fBset_max_field\fR sets the maximum size for a dynamic field.
An argument of 0 turns off any maximum size threshold for that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBfield_buffer\fR function returns NULL on error.

The \fBfield_status\fR function returns \fBTRUE\fR or \fBFALSE\fR.

The remaining routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3) and 3 pages whose names begin with "form_" for detailed
descriptions of the entry points.
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.

S. Raymond.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

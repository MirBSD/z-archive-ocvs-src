.SH NAME
\fBform_field_validation\fR - data type validation for fields
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int set_field_type(FIELD *field, FIELDTYPE *type, ...);
.br
FIELDTYPE *field_type(const FIELD *field);
.br
void *field_arg(const FIELD *field);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_type\fR declares a data type for a given form field.
This is the type checked by validation functions.  The types are as follows:
.TP 5
TYPE_ALNUM
Alphanumeric data.  Requires a third \fBint\fR argument, a minimum field width.
.TP 5
TYPE_ALPHA
Character data.  Requires a third \fBint\fR argument, a minimum field width.
.TP 5
TYPE_ENUM
Accept one of a specified set of strings.  Requires a third \fB(char **)\fR
argument pointing to a string list; a fourth \fBint\fR flag argument to enable
case-sensitivity; and a fifth \fBint\fR flag argument specifying whether a partial
match must be a unique one (if this flag is off, a prefix matches the first
of any set of more than one list elements with that prefix). Please notice
that the string list is not copied, only a reference to it is stored in the
field. So you should avoid to use a list that lives in automatic variables
on the stack.
.TP 5
TYPE_INTEGER
Integer data, parsable to an integer by \fBatoi(3)\fR.  Requires a third
\fBint\fR argument controlling the precision, a fourth \fBlong\fR argument
constraining minimum value, and a fifth \fBlong\fR constraining maximum value.
If the maximum value is less or equal the minimum value, the range is simply
ignored. On return the field buffer is formatted according to the \fBprintf\fR
format specification ".*ld", where the '*' is replaced by the precision argument.
For details of the precision handling see \fBprintf's\fR man-page.
.TP 5
TYPE_NUMERIC
Numeric data (may have a decimal-point part). Requires a third
\fBint\fR argument controlling the precision, a fourth \fBdouble\fR
argument constraining minimum value, and a fifth \fBdouble\fR constraining
maximum value. If your system supports locale's, the decimal point character
to be used must be the one specified by your locale.
If the maximum value is less or equal the minimum value, the range is simply
ignored. On return the field buffer is formatted according to the \fBprintf\fR
format specification ".*f", where the '*' is replaced by the precision argument.
For details of the precision handling see \fBprintf's\fR man-page.
.TP 5
TYPE_REGEXP
Regular expression data.  Requires a regular expression \fB(char *)\fR third argument;
the data is valid if the regular expression matches it.  Regular expressions
are in the format of \fBregcomp\fR(3) and \fBregexec\fR(3). Please notice
that the regular expression must match the whole field. If you have for
example an eight character wide field, a regular expression "^[0-9]*$" always
means that you have to fill all eight positions with digits. If you want to
allow fewer digits, you may use for example "^[0-9]* *$" which is good for
trailing spaces (up to an empty field), or "^ *[0-9]* *$" which is good for
leading and trailing spaces around the digits.
.TP 5
TYPE_IPV4
An Internet Protocol Version 4 address. This requires no additional argument. It
is checked whether or not the buffer has the form a.b.c.d, where a,b,c and d are
numbers between 0 and 255. Trailing blanks in the buffer are ignored. The address
itself is not validated. Please note that this is an ncurses extension. This
field type may not be available in other curses implementations.

It is possible to set up new programmer-defined field types.  See the
\fBform_fieldtype\fR(3) manual page.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The functions \fBfield_type\fR and \fBfield_arg\fR return \fBNULL\fR on
error. The function \fBset_field_type\fR returns one of the following:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3), \fBform\fR(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.SH AUTHORS
Juergen Pfeifer.  Manual pages and adaptation for new curses by Eric
S. Raymond.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

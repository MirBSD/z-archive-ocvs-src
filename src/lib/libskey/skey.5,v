.Sh NAME
.Nm skey
.Nd one-time password user database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/skey
directory contains user records for the S/Key one-time password authentication
system.
.Pp
Records take the form of files within
.Pa /etc/skey
where each file is named for the user whose record it contains.
For example,
.Pa /etc/skey/root
would hold root's S/Key record.
.Pp
The mode for
.Pa /etc/skey  
should be 01730 and it should be owned by root and group auth.
Individual records within
.Pa /etc/skey
should be owned by the user they describe and be mode 0600.
To access S/Key records, a process must run as group auth.
.Pp
Each record consists of five lines:
.Bl -enum
.It
The name of the user the record describes.
This should be the same as the name of the file.
.It
The hash type used for this entry;
one of md4, md5, sha1, or rmd160.
The default is md5.
.It
The sequence number.
This is a decimal number between one and one thousand.
Each time the user authenticates via S/Key this number is decremented by one.
.It
A seed used along with the sequence number and the six S/Key words to
compute the value.
.It
The value expected from the crunching of the user's seed, sequence number
and the six S/Key words.
When the result matches this value, authentication is considered to have
been successful.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Here is a sample
.Pa /etc/skey
file for root:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

 * Routine to perform cursor addressing.

 * The following escapes are defined for substituting row/column:
 *
 *	%d	as in printf
 *	%2	like %2d
 *	%3	like %3d
 *	%.	gives %c hacking special case characters
 *	%+x	like %c but adding x first
 *
 *	The codes below affect the state but don't use up a value.
 *
 *	%>xy	if value > x add y
 *	%r	reverses row/column
 *	%i	increments row/column (for one origin indexing)
 *	%%	gives %

 *	%D	Delta Data (backwards bcd)

1.1.1.3
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

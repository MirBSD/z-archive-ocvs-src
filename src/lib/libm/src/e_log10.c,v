/* __ieee754_log10(x)
 * Return the base 10 logarithm of x
 * 
 * Method :
 *	Let log10_2hi = leading 40 bits of log10(2) and
 *	    log10_2lo = log10(2) - log10_2hi,
 *	    ivln10   = 1/log(10) rounded.
 *	Then
 *		n = ilogb(x), 
 *		if(n<0)  n = n+1;
 *		x = scalbn(x,-n);
 *		log10(x) := n*log10_2hi + (n*log10_2lo + ivln10*log(x))
 *
 * Note 1:
 *	To guarantee log10(10**n)=n, where 10**n is normal, the rounding 
 *	mode must set to Round-to-Nearest.
 * Note 2:
 *	[1/log(10)] rounded to 53 bits has error  .198   ulps;
 *	log10 is monotonic at all binary break points.
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	log10(x) is NaN with signal if x < 0; 
 *	log10(+INF) is +INF with no signal; log10(0) is -INF with signal;
 *	log10(NaN) is that NaN with no signal;
 *	log10(10**N) = N  for N=0,1,...,22.
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

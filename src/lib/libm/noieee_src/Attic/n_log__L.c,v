 *
 * Method :
 *	1. Polynomial approximation: let s = x/(2+x). 
 *	   Based on log(1+x) = log(1+s) - log(1-s)
 *		 = 2s + 2/3 s**3 + 2/5 s**5 + .....,
 *
 *	   (log(1+x) - 2s)/s is computed by
 *
 *	       z*(L1 + z*(L2 + z*(... (L7 + z*L8)...)))
 *
 *	   where z=s*s. (See the listing below for Lk's values.) The 
 *	   coefficients are obtained by a special Remez algorithm. 
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	Assuming no rounding error, the maximum magnitude of the approximation 
 *	error (absolute) is 2**(-58.49) for IEEE double, and 2**(-63.63)
 *	for VAX D format.
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

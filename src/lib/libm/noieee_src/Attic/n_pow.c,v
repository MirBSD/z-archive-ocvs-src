/* POW(X,Y)  
 * RETURN X**Y 
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D format 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/8/85; 
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 7/10/85.
 * KERNEL pow_P() REPLACED BY P. McILROY 7/22/92.
 * Required system supported functions:
 *      scalbn(x,n)      
 *      logb(x)         
 *	copysign(x,y)	
 *	finite(x)	
 *	drem(x,y)
 *
 * Required kernel functions:
 *	exp__D(a,c)			exp(a + c) for |a| << |c|
 *	struct d_double dlog(x)		r.a + r.b, |r.b| < |r.a|
 *
 * Method
 *	1. Compute and return log(x) in three pieces:
 *		log(x) = n*ln2 + hi + lo,
 *	   where n is an integer.
 *	2. Perform y*log(x) by simulating muti-precision arithmetic and 
 *	   return the answer in three pieces:
 *		y*log(x) = m*ln2 + hi + lo,
 *	   where m is an integer.
 *	3. Return x**y = exp(y*log(x))
 *		= 2^m * ( exp(hi+lo) ).
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	(anything) ** 0  is 1 ;
 *	(anything) ** 1  is itself;
 *	(anything) ** NaN is NaN;
 *	NaN ** (anything except 0) is NaN;
 *	+(anything > 1) ** +INF is +INF;
 *	-(anything > 1) ** +INF is NaN;
 *	+-(anything > 1) ** -INF is +0;
 *	+-(anything < 1) ** +INF is +0;
 *	+(anything < 1) ** -INF is +INF;
 *	-(anything < 1) ** -INF is NaN;
 *	+-1 ** +-INF is NaN and signal INVALID;
 *	+0 ** +(anything except 0, NaN)  is +0;
 *	-0 ** +(anything except 0, NaN, odd integer)  is +0;
 *	+0 ** -(anything except 0, NaN)  is +INF and signal DIV-BY-ZERO;
 *	-0 ** -(anything except 0, NaN, odd integer)  is +INF with signal;
 *	-0 ** (odd integer) = -( +0 ** (odd integer) );
 *	+INF ** +(anything except 0,NaN) is +INF;
 *	+INF ** -(anything except 0,NaN) is +0;
 *	-INF ** (odd integer) = -( +INF ** (odd integer) );
 *	-INF ** (even integer) = ( +INF ** (even integer) );
 *	-INF ** -(anything except integer,NaN) is NaN with signal;
 *	-(x=anything) ** (k=integer) is (-1)**k * (x ** k);
 *	-(anything except 0) ** (non-integer) is NaN with signal;
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	pow(x,y) returns x**y nearly rounded. In particular, on a SUN, a VAX,
 *	and a Zilog Z8000,
 *			pow(integer,integer)
 *	always returns the correct integer provided it is representable.
 *	In a test run with 100,000 random arguments with 0 < x, y < 20.0
 *	on a VAX, the maximum observed error was 1.79 ulps (units in the 
 *	last place).
 *
 * Constants :
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

/* LOG1P(x) 
 * RETURN THE LOGARITHM OF 1+x
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D FORMAT 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/19/85; 
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/6/85, 3/7/85, 3/24/85, 4/16/85.
 * 
 * Required system supported functions:
 *	scalbn(x,n) 
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	logb(x)	
 *	finite(x)
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log__L(z)
 *
 * Method :
 *	1. Argument Reduction: find k and f such that 
 *			1+x  = 2^k * (1+f), 
 *	   where  sqrt(2)/2 < 1+f < sqrt(2) .
 *
 *	2. Let s = f/(2+f) ; based on log(1+f) = log(1+s) - log(1-s)
 *		 = 2s + 2/3 s**3 + 2/5 s**5 + .....,
 *	   log(1+f) is computed by
 *
 *	     		log(1+f) = 2s + s*log__L(s*s)
 *	   where
 *		log__L(z) = z*(L1 + z*(L2 + z*(... (L6 + z*L7)...)))
 *
 *	   See log__L() for the values of the coefficients.
 *
 *	3. Finally,  log(1+x) = k*ln2 + log(1+f).  
 *
 *	Remarks 1. In step 3 n*ln2 will be stored in two floating point numbers
 *		   n*ln2hi + n*ln2lo, where ln2hi is chosen such that the last 
 *		   20 bits (for VAX D format), or the last 21 bits ( for IEEE 
 *		   double) is 0. This ensures n*ln2hi is exactly representable.
 *		2. In step 1, f may not be representable. A correction term c
 *	 	   for f is computed. It follows that the correction term for
 *		   f - t (the leading term of log(1+f) in step 2) is c-c*x. We
 *		   add this correction term to n*ln2lo to attenuate the error.
 *
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	log1p(x) is NaN with signal if x < -1; log1p(NaN) is NaN with no signal;
 *	log1p(INF) is +INF; log1p(-1) is -INF with signal;
 *	only log1p(0)=0 is exact for finite argument.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	log1p(x) returns the exact log(1+x) nearly rounded. In a test run 
 *	with 1,536,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum observed
 *	error was .846 ulps (units in the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

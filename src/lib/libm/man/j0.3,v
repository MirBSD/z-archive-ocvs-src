.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn j0
and
.Fn j1
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the first kind of the order
0 and the
.Em order
1, respectively,
for the
real value
.Fa x ;
the function
.Fn jn
computes the
.Em Bessel function of the first kind of the integer order
.Fa n
for the real value
.Fa x .
The functions
.Fn j0f ,
.Fn j1f ,
and
.Fn jnf
are single precision versions of
.Fn j0 ,
.Fn j1 ,
and
.Fn jn ,
respectively.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn y0
and
.Fn y1
compute the linearly independent
.Em Bessel function of the second kind of the order
0 and the
.Em order
1, respectively,
for the
positive
.Em integer
value
.Fa x
(expressed as a double);
the function
.Fn yn
computes the
.Em Bessel function of the second kind for the integer order
.Fa n
for the positive
.Em integer
value
.Fa x
(expressed as a double).
The functions
.Fn y0f ,
.Fn y1f ,
and
.Fn ynf
are single precision versions of
.Fn y0 ,
.Fn y1 ,
and
.Fn yn ,
respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If these functions are successful,
the computed value is returned, otherwise the global variable
.Va errno
is set to EDOM or ERANGE.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import OpenBSD repository of CTM 3155 (roughly today at noon).
Mostly in order to go 3.3-current and ease further merges of
both OpenBSD and ELFdiffs after the MirBSD has been enabled
to build again.

1.1.1.3
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

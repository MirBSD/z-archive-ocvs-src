.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are required or recommended by
.St -ieee754 .
.Pp
.Fn copysign
returns
.Fa x
with its sign changed to
.Fa y Ns 's.
The
.Fn copysignf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn copysign .
.Pp
.Fn finite
returns the value 1 just when
\-\*(If \*(Lt
.Fa x
\*(Lt +\*(If;
otherwise a
zero is returned
(when
.Pf \\*(Ba Ns Fa x Ns \\*(Ba
= \*(If or
.Fa x
is \*(Na
The
.Fn finitef
function is a single precision version of
.Fn finite .
.Pp
.Fn ilogb
returns
.Fa x Ns 's exponent
.Fa n ,
in integer format.
.Fn ilogb \*(Pm\*(If
returns
.Dv INT_MAX
and
.Fn ilogb 0
returns
.Dv INT_MIN .
The
.Fn ilogbf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn ilogb .
.Pp
.Fn nextafter
returns the next machine representable number from
.Fa x
in direction
.Fa y .
The
.Fn nextafterf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn nextafter .
.Pp
.Fn remainder
returns the remainder
.Fa r
:=
.Fa x
\-
.Fa n\(**y
where
.Fa n
is the integer nearest the exact value of
.Bk -words
.Fa x Ns / Ns Fa y ;
.Ek
moreover if
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa n
\-
.Sm off
.Fa x No / Fa y No \\*(Ba
.Sm on
=
1/2
then
.Fa n
is even.  Consequently
the remainder is computed exactly and
.Sm off
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa r No \\*(Ba
.Sm on
\*(Le
.Sm off
.Pf \\*(Ba Fa y No \\*(Ba/2.
.Sm on
But
.Fn remainder x 0
and
.Fn remainder \*(If 0
are invalid operations that produce a \*(Na.
The
.Fn remainderf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn remainder .
.Pp
.Fn scalbn
returns
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
The
.Fn scalbnf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn scalbn .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

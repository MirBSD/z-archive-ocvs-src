.Sh NAME
.Nm png
.Nd Portable Network Graphics format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library contains functions dealing with files in the PNG format.
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for
the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.
PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also
replace many common uses of TIFF.
Indexed-colour, grayscale, and truecolour images are supported,
plus an optional alpha channel.
Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits.
.Pp
PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such
as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a
progressive display option.
PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and
fast, simple detection of common transmission errors.
Also, PNG can storegamma and chromaticity data for improved
colour matching on heterogeneous platforms.

@* clean up the licence mess in the manpages,
  refer to the reference spec in <png.h> instead
* clean up the licence mess in png.h, sorting the (c),
  indenting correctly, adding our own (c) on top
* "distinguish from upsteam version", ie. add -MirOS
  to the version string
* whitespace cleanup, RCS IDs
* remove optimised i386 assembly version
* remove a shitload of Windows® and Macintosh® specifica
* fix and make it build using -Wall -Werror
* rewrite png(5) in mdoc and prettyfy

libpng is OSI certified Open Source software; the small wording mistake
to not write "with or without fee" in the licence (png.h) was fixed by

Libpng 1.2.5 - October 3, 2002

This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.4):

  Revised makefile.cygwin to use DLL number 12 instead of 13.
  Added code to contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c to ignore unused chunks.
  Replaced toucan.png in contrib/gregbook (it has been corrupt since 1.0.11)
  Removed some stray *.o files from contrib/gregbook.
  Changed png_error() to png_warning() about "Too much data" in pngpread.c
    and about "Extra compressed data" in pngrutil.c.
  Prevent png_ptr->pass from exceeding 7 in png_push_finish_row().
  Updated makefile.hggcc
  Updated png.c and pnggccrd.c handling of return from png_mmx_support()
  Only issue png_warning() about "Too much data" in pngpread.c when avail_in
    is nonzero.
  Updated makefiles to install a separate libpng.so.3 with its own rpath.
  Revised makefiles to not remove previous minor versions of shared libraries.
  Revised 13 makefiles to remove "-lz" and "-L$(ZLIBLIB)", etc., from shared
    library loader directive.
  Revised libpng-config script.
  Relocated two misplaced PNGAPI lines in pngtest.c

@Import the PNG library from ports/graphics/png/w-png-1.2.5p2/libpng-1.2.5

libpng is OSI certified Open Source software; the small wording mistake
to not write "with or without fee" in the licence (png.h) was fixed by
encouraging the use in commercial software

    PNG Spec (second edition) and the PNG ISO/IEC Standard.
  Added "test-dd" target in 15 makefiles, to run pngtest in DESTDIR.

    png_set_filler().

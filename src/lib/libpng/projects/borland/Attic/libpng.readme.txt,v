@Project files to build libpng using Borland C++ Builder v5.0

To use this dll, you will need to:

1) add the following conditional defines to your project

PNG_USE_DLL
Z_PREFIX

2) add the paths to png.h and zlib.h to your include path

3) add libpng.lib or libpngstat.lib to the project.

If you are using libpng.dll, libpng.dll and zlib.dll will be required for the code to run.

Alternatively, the libpng.dll can be built using zlibstat.lib to produce one dll containing both the zlib and png code.

See the libpng documentation for instructions on how to use the code.

@Import the PNG library from ports/graphics/png/w-png-1.2.5p2/libpng-1.2.5

to not write "with or without fee" in the licence (png.h) was fixed by
encouraging the use in commercial software

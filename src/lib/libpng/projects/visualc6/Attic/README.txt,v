@Microsoft Developer Studio Project File, Format Version 6.00 for libpng.

Copyright (C) 2000-2004 Simon-Pierre Cadieux.
Copyright (C) 2004 Cosmin Truta.
For conditions of distribution and use, see copyright notice in png.h


Assumptions:
* The libpng source files are in ..\..
* The zlib source files are in ..\..\..\zlib
* The zlib project files are in ..\..\..\zlib\projects\visualc6


To use:

1) On the main menu, select "File | Open Workspace".
   Open "libpng.dsw".

2) Select "Build | Set Active Configuration".
   Choose the configuration you wish to build.
   (Choose libpng or pngtest; zlib will be built automatically.)

3) Select "Build | Clean".

4) Select "Build | Build ... (F7)".  Ignore warning messages about
   not being able to find certain include files (e.g. alloc.h).

5) If you built the sample program (pngtest),
   select "Build | Execute ... (Ctrl+F5)".


This project builds the libpng binaries as follows:

* Win32_DLL_Release\libpng13.dll      DLL build
* Win32_DLL_Debug\libpng13d.dll       DLL build (debug version)
* Win32_DLL_ASM_Release\libpng13.dll  DLL build using ASM code
* Win32_DLL_ASM_Debug\libpng13d.dll   DLL build using ASM (debug version)
* Win32_DLL_VB\libpng13vb.dll         DLL build for Visual Basic, using stdcall
* Win32_LIB_Release\libpng.lib        static build
* Win32_LIB_Debug\libpngd.lib         static build (debug version)
* Win32_LIB_ASM_Release\libpng.lib    static build using ASM code
* Win32_LIB_ASM_Debug\libpngd.lib     static build using ASM (debug version)


Notes:

If you change anything in the source files, or select different compiler
settings, please change the DLL name to something different than any of
the above names.

Also, make sure that DLLFNAME_POSTFIX and (PRIVATEBUILD or SPECIALBUILD)
are defined when compiling the resource file.  DLLFNAME_POSTFIX contains
the trailing letters that come after the version number.  PRIVATEBUILD
and/or SPECIALBUILD store information describing the type of change made
in the VERSIONINFO structure.  Please refer to MSDN for more information
on the used macros and the nature of their content.  For an example on
how to define these macros, look at the resource compiler settings for
the "Win32 DLL VB" configuration.

All DLLs built by this project use the Microsoft dynamic C runtime library
MSVCRT.DLL (MSVCRTD.DLL for debug versions).  If you distribute any of the
above mentioned libraries you should also include this DLL in your package.
For a list of files that are redistributable in Visual C++ 6.0, see
Common\Redist\Redist.txt on Disc 1 of the Visual C++ 6.0 product CDs.

PNG_USER_PRIVATEBUILD and PNG_USER_DLLFNAME_POSTFIX according to the
instructions provided in "pngconf.h".

@conform to the ABI, except thanks to the Santa Cruz,
whatever they are named now, Caldera:


Functions Returning Structures or Unions

If a function returns a structure or union, then the caller provides space for the
return value and places its address on the stack as argument word zero.  In effect,
this address becomes a `hidden'' first argument.  Having the caller supply the
return object's space allows re-entrancy.

         Structures and unions in this context have fixed sizes.  The ABI does not
 NOTE    specify how to handle variable sized objects.

3-14                                                             LOW-LEVEL SYSTEM INFORMATION

                                                  DRAFT COPY
                                                  March 19, 1997
                                        File: abi_386/chap3 (Delta 44.6)
                                                 386:adm.book:sum

A function that returns a structure or union also sets %eax to the value of the
original address of the caller's area before it returns.  Thus when the caller receives
control again, the address of the returned object resides in register %eax and can
be used to access the object.  Both the calling and the called functions must
cooperate to pass the return value successfully:

      The calling function must supply space for the return value and pass its
      address in the stack frame;

      The called function must use the address from the frame and copy the
      return value to the object so supplied;

      The called function must remove this address from the stack before return-
      ing.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

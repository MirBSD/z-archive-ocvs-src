@sparc has to die :(

it was nice while it lasted, but I couldn't even live up to
my promise to provide XFree86 4.4.0 on sparc due to lack of
time (and money and health).

also, compat_freebsd dies, without prejudice.

<mirabile> benz: sparc darf sterben?
<mirabile> compat_freebsd darf sterben?
<benz> na gut

in addition, some set shuffling (it was a good idea originally
to pull out gcc3 specifics to the egcs set, but with gcc3 being
the only compiler that isn't it any more)

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:

# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by

.Dd June 4, 1993
.Dt GETPRIORITY 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getpriority ,
.Nm setpriority
.Nd get/set program scheduling priority
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/time.h>
.Fd #include <sys/resource.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getpriority "int which" "int who"
.Ft int
.Fn setpriority "int which" "int who" "int prio"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user,
as indicated by
.Fa which
and
.Fa who
is obtained with the
.Fn getpriority
call and set with the
.Fn setpriority
call.
.Fa which
is one of
.Dv PRIO_PROCESS ,
.Dv PRIO_PGRP ,
or
.Dv PRIO_USER ,
and
.Fa who
is interpreted relative to
.Fa which
(a process identifier for
.Dv PRIO_PROCESS ,
process group identifier for
.Dv PRIO_PGRP ,
and a user ID for
.Dv PRIO_USER ) .
A zero value of
.Fa who
denotes the current process, process group, or user.
.Fa prio
is a value in the range \-20 to 20.
The default priority is 0;
lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.
.Pp
The
.Fn getpriority
call returns the highest priority (lowest numerical value)
enjoyed by any of the specified processes.
The
.Fn setpriority
call sets the priorities of all of the specified processes
to the specified value.
Only the superuser may lower priorities.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Since
.Fn getpriority
can legitimately return the value \-1, it is necessary
to clear the external variable
.Va errno
prior to the
call, then check it afterward to determine
if a \-1 is an error or a legitimate value.
The
.Fn setpriority
call returns 0 if there is no error, or
\-1 if there is.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getpriority
and
.Fn setpriority
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No process was located using the
.Fa which
and
.Fa who
values specified.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa which
was not one of
.Dv PRIO_PROCESS ,
.Dv PRIO_PGRP ,
or
.Dv PRIO_USER .
.El
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Er
In addition to the errors indicated above,
.Fn setpriority
will fail if:
.It Bq Er EPERM
A process was located, but neither its effective nor real user
ID matched the effective user ID of the caller.
.It Bq Er EACCES
A non-superuser attempted to lower a process priority.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nice 1 ,
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr renice 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getpriority
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

The default priority is 0; lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.

Priority values outside the range \-20 to 20 are truncated to the
appropriate limit.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

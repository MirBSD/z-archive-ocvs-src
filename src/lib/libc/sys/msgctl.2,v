.Dt MSGCTL 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm msgctl
.Nd message control operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/ipc.h>
.Fd #include <sys/msg.h>
.Ft int
.Fn msgctl "int msqid" "int cmd" "struct msqid_ds *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn msgctl
system call performs some control operations on the message queue specified
by
.Fa msqid .
.Pp
Each message queue has a data structure associated with it, parts of which
may be altered by
.Fn msgctl
and parts of which determine the actions of
.Fn msgctl .
The data structure is defined in
.Aq Pa sys/msg.h
and contains (amongst others) the following members:
.Bd -literal
struct msqid_ds {
	struct ipc_perm msg_perm;	/* msg queue permission bits */
	u_long		msg_cbytes;	/* # of bytes in use on the queue */
	u_long		msg_qnum;	/* # of msgs in the queue */
	u_long		msg_qbytes;	/* max # of bytes on the queue */
	pid_t		msg_lspid;	/* pid of last msgsnd() */
	pid_t		msg_lrpid;	/* pid of last msgrcv() */
	time_t		msg_stime;	/* time of last msgsnd() */
	time_t		msg_rtime;	/* time of last msgrcv() */
	time_t		msg_ctime;	/* time of last msgctl() */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Bf -literal
ipc_perm
.Ef
structure used inside the
.Bf -literal
shmid_ds
.Ef
structure is defined in
.Aq Pa sys/ipc.h
and looks like this:
.Bd -literal
struct ipc_perm {
	uid_t	cuid;	/* creator user id */
	gid_t	cgid;	/* creator group id */
	uid_t	uid;	/* user id */
	gid_t	gid;	/* group id */
	mode_t	mode;	/* permission (9 bits, see chmod(2)) */
	u_short	seq;	/* sequence # (to generate unique id) */
	key_t	key;	/* user specified msg/sem/shm key */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The operation to be performed by
.Fn msgctl
is specified in
.Fa cmd
and is one of:
.Bl -tag -width IPC_RMIDX
.It Dv IPC_STAT
Gather information about the message queue and place it in the
structure pointed to by
.Fa buf .
.It Dv IPC_SET
Set the value of the
.Va msg_perm.uid ,
.Va msg_perm.gid ,
.Va msg_perm.mode
and
.Va msg_qbytes
fields in the structure associated with
.Fa msqid .
The values are taken from the corresponding fields in the structure
pointed to by
.Fa buf .
This operation can only be executed by the superuser, or a process that
has an effective user ID equal to either
.Va msg_perm.cuid
or
.Va msg_perm.uid
in the data structure associated with the message queue.
The value of
.Va msg_qbytes
can only be increased by the superuser.
Values for
.Va msg_qbytes
that exceed the system limit
.Pf ( Dv MSGMNB
from
.Aq Pa sys/msg.h )
are silently truncated to that limit.
.Pp
.It Dv IPC_RMID
Remove the message queue specified by
.Fa msqid
and destroy the data associated with it.
Only the superuser or a process with an effective UID equal to the
.Va msg_perm.cuid
or
.Va msg_perm.uid
values in the data structure associated with the queue can do this.
.El
.Pp
The permission to read from or write to a message queue (see
.Xr msgsnd 2
and
.Xr msgrcv 2 )
is determined by the
.Va msg_perm.mode
field in the same way as is
done with files (see
.Xr chmod 2 ) ,
but the effective UID can match either the
.Va msg_perm.cuid
field or the
.Va msg_perm.uid
field, and the
effective GID can match either
.Va msg_perm.cgid
or
.Va msg_perm.gid .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn msgctl
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
.Fa cmd
is equal to
.Dv IPC_SET
or
.Dv IPC_RMID
and the caller is not the superuser, nor does
the effective UID match either the
.Va msg_perm.uid
or
.Va msg_perm.cuid
fields of the data structure associated with the message queue.
.Pp
An attempt is made to increase the value of
.Va msg_qbytes
through
.Dv IPC_SET
but the caller is not the superuser.
.It Bq Er EACCES
The command is
.Dv IPC_STAT
and the caller has no read permission for this message queue.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa msqid
is not a valid message queue identifier.
.Pp
.Va cmd
is not a valid command.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa buf
specifies an invalid address.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr msgget 2 ,
.Xr msgrcv 2 ,
.Xr msgsnd 2
.Sh HISTORY
Message queues appeared in the first release of AT&T Unix System V.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Dt GETTIMEOFDAY 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gettimeofday ,
.Nm settimeofday
.Nd get/set date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/time.h>
.Ft int
.Fn gettimeofday "struct timeval *tp" "struct timezone *tzp"
.Ft int
.Fn settimeofday "const struct timeval *tp" "const struct timezone *tzp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
Note: timezone is no longer used; this information is kept outside
the kernel.
.Ef
.Pp
The system's notion of the current Greenwich time and the current time
zone is obtained with the
.Fn gettimeofday
call, and set with the
.Fn settimeofday
call.
The time is expressed in seconds and microseconds since the epoch,
00:00:00 seconds at midnight (0 hour), January 1, 1970, Temps
Atomique International (TAI).
Leap seconds are counted, violating POSIX but providing correct time.
The resolution of the system clock is hardware dependent, and the time
may be updated continuously or in
.Dq ticks .
If
.Fa tp
or
.Fa tzp
is
.Dv NULL ,
the associated time
information will not be returned or set.
.Pp
The structures pointed to by
.Fa tp
and
.Fa tzp
are defined in
.Ao Pa sys/time.h Ac
as:
.Bd -literal
struct timeval {
	time_t	tv_sec;		/* seconds since Jan. 1, 1970, 00:00:00 */
	long	tv_usec;	/* and microseconds */
};

struct timezone {
	int	tz_minuteswest; /* of Greenwich */
	int	tz_dsttime;	/* type of dst correction to apply */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa timezone
structure indicates the local time zone
(measured in minutes of time westward from Greenwich),
and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that
Daylight Saving time applies locally during
the appropriate part of the year.
.Pp
Only the superuser may set the time of day or time zone.
If the system securelevel is greater than 1 (see
.Xr init 8 ) ,
the time may only be advanced.
This limitation is imposed to prevent a malicious superuser
from setting arbitrary time stamps on files.
The system time can still be adjusted backwards using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call even when the system is secure.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded.
A \-1 return value indicates an error occurred, and in this
case an error code is stored into the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width [EFAULT]
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An argument address referenced invalid memory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
A user other than the superuser attempted to set the time.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr date 1 ,
.Xr adjtime 2 ,
.Xr ctime 3 ,
.Xr timed 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn gettimeofday
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The
.Va tv_sec
element of struct timeval is of type time_t since
.Mx 8 .
@


1.2
log
@struct timeval { tv_sec; tv_usec; };
=> old: long tv_sec; long tv_usec;
=> new: time_t tv_sec; long tv_usec;

No binary change, because i386 and sparc are ILP32.
No impact on LP64, because we prepare for 64 bit time_t.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

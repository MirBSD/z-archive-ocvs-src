.Dt MOUNT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount ,
.Nm unmount
.Nd mount or dismount a filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn mount "const char *type" "const char *dir" "int flags" "void *data"
.Ft int
.Fn unmount "const char *dir" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mount
function grafts
a filesystem object onto the system file tree
at the point
.Fa dir .
The argument
.Fa data
describes the filesystem object to be mounted.
The argument
.Fa type
tells the kernel how to interpret
.Fa data
(see
.Fa type
below).
The contents of the filesystem
become available through the new mount point
.Fa dir .
Any files in
.Fa dir
at the time
of a successful mount are swept under the carpet, so to speak, and
are unavailable until the filesystem is unmounted.
.Pp
The following
.Fa flags
may be specified to
suppress default semantics which affect filesystem access.
.Bl -tag -width MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
.It Dv MNT_RDONLY
The filesystem should be treated as read-only:
even the superuser may not write to it.
.It Dv MNT_NOATIME
Do not update the access time on files in the filesystem unless
the modification or status change times are also being updated.
.It Dv MNT_NOEXEC
Do not allow files to be executed from the filesystem.
.It Dv MNT_NOSUID
Do not honor setuid or setgid bits on files when executing them.
.It Dv MNT_NODEV
Do not interpret special files on the filesystem.
.It Dv MNT_UNION
Mount in such a way that the contents of the underlying filesystem are
not (totally) obscured (see
.Xr mount_union 8 ) .
.It Dv MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously.
.It Dv MNT_ASYNC
All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously.
.It Dv MNT_SOFTDEP
Use soft dependencies.
Applies to FFS filesystems only (see 'softdep' in
.Xr mount 8 ) .
.El
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MNT_UPDATE
indicates that the mount command is being applied
to an already mounted filesystem.
This allows the mount flags to be changed without requiring
that the filesystem be unmounted and remounted.
Some filesystems may not allow all flags to be changed.
For example,
most filesystems will not allow a change from read-write to read-only.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument defines the type of the filesystem.
The types of filesystems known to the system are defined in
.Aq Pa sys/mount.h .
.Fa data
is a pointer to a structure that contains the type
specific arguments to mount.
The currently supported types of filesystems and
their type specific data are:

.Pp
The
.Fn unmount
function call disassociates the filesystem from the specified
mount point
.Fa dir .
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may specify
.Dv MNT_FORCE
to specify that the filesystem should be forcibly unmounted even if files are
still active.
Active special devices continue to work,
but any further accesses to any other active files result in errors
even if the filesystem is later remounted.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn mount
returns the value 0 if the mount was successful; otherwise, \-1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Fn unmount
returns the value 0 if the unmount was successful; otherwise, \-1 is returned
and the variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn mount
will fail when one of the following occurs:
.Bl -tag -width [ENAMETOOLONG]
.It Bq Er EPERM

1.1.1.7
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

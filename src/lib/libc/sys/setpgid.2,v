.Sh NAME
.Nm setpgid ,
.Nm setpgrp
.Nd set process group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn setpgid "pid_t pid" "pid_t pgrp"
.Ft int
.Fn setpgrp "pid_t pid" "pid_t pgrp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn setpgid
sets the process group of the specified process
.Ar pid
to the specified
.Ar pgrp .
If
.Ar pid
is zero, then the call applies to the current process.
.Pp
If the invoker is not the superuser, then the affected process
must have the same effective user ID as the invoker or be a descendant
of the invoking process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn setpgid
returns 0 when the operation was successful.
If the request failed, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
indicates the reason.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn setpgid
will fail and the process group will not be altered if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
The value of the
.Fa pid
argument matches the process ID of a child process of the calling process,
and the child process has successfully executed one of the exec functions.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa pgrp
argument is less than zero.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The effective user ID of the requested process is different
from that of the caller and the process is not a descendant
of the calling process.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
The value of the
.Fa pid
argument does not match the process ID of the calling process or of a
child process of the calling process.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getpgrp 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn setpgid
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Fn setpgrp
is identical to
.Fn setpgid ,
and is retained for calling convention compatibility with historical
versions of
.Bx .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Dt SEMOP 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm semop
.Nd semaphore operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/ipc.h>
.Fd #include <sys/sem.h>
.Ft int
.Fn semop "int semid" "struct sembuf *sops" "int nsops"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn semop
provides a number of atomic operations on a set of semaphores.
The semaphore set is specified by
.Fa semid .
.Fa sops
is an array of semaphore operations,
.Fa nsops
is the number of operations in this array.
The
.Va sembuf
structures in the array contain the following members:
.Bd -literal
        u_short sem_num;        /* semaphore # */
        short   sem_op;         /* semaphore operation */
        short   sem_flg;        /* operation flags */
.Ed
.Pp
Each operation (specified in
.Va sem_op )
is applied to semaphore number
.Va sem_num
in the set of semaphores specified by
.Fa semid .
The value of
.Va sem_op
determines the action taken in the following way:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Va sem_op
is less than 0.
The current process is blocked until the value of the
semaphore is greater than or equal to the absolute value of
.Va sem_op .
The absolute value of
.Va sem_op
is then subtracted from the value of the semaphore, and the calling
process continues.
Negative values of
.Va sem_op
are thus used to enter critical regions.
.It
.Va sem_op
is greater than 0.
Its value is added to the value of the specified semaphore.
This is used to leave critical regions.
.It
.Va sem_op
is equal to 0.
The calling process is blocked until the value of the specified
semaphore reaches 0.
.El
.Pp
The behavior of each operation is influenced by the flags set in
.Va sem_flg
in the following way:
.Bl -tag -width IPC_NOWAITX
.It Dv IPC_NOWAIT
In the case where the calling process would normally block, waiting
for a semaphore to reach a certain value,
.Dv IPC_NOWAIT
makes the
call return immediately, returning a value of \-1 and setting
.Va errno
to
.Er EAGAIN .
.It Dv SEM_UNDO
Keep track of the changes that this call makes to the value of a semaphore,
so that they can be undone when the calling process terminates.
This is useful to prevent other processes waiting on a semaphore to
block forever, should the process that has the semaphore locked
terminate in a critical section.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn semop
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
There is no semaphore associated with
.Fa semid .
.Pp
The semaphore set was removed while the process was waiting for one of
its semaphores to reach a certain value.
.Pp
.It Bq Er EACCES
The calling process has no permission to access the specified semaphore set.
.It Bq Er E2BIG
The value of
.Fa nsops
is too big.
The maximum is specified in MAX_SOPS in
.Aq Pa sys/sem.h .
.It Bq Er EFBIG
.Va sem_num
in one of the sem_buf structures is less than 0, or greater than the actual
number of semaphores in the set specified by
.Fa semid .
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
.Dv SEM_UNDO
was requested, and there is not enough space left in the kernel to
store the undo information.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The requested operation can not immediately be performed, and
.Dv IPC_NOWAIT
was set in
.Va sem_flg .
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa sops
points to an illegal address.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr semctl 2 ,
.Xr semget 2
.Sh BUGS
In case of a removed semaphore identifier,
.Va errno
should be set to
.Er EIDRM ,
but
.Ox
does not define this error.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.3
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

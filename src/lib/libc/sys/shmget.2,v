.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm shmget
.Nd get shared memory area identifier
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/ipc.h>
.Fd #include <sys/shm.h>
.Ft int
.Fn shmget "key_t key" "int size" "int shmflg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn shmget
returns the shared memory identifier associated with the key
.Fa key .
.Pp
A shared memory segment is created if either
.Fa key
is equal to
.Dv IPC_PRIVATE ,
or
.Fa key
does not have a shared memory segment identifier associated with it, and the
.Dv IPC_CREAT
bit is set in
.Fa shmflg .
.Pp
If a new shared memory segment is created, the data structure associated with
it (the
.Va shmid_ds
structure, see
.Xr shmctl 2 )
is initialized as follows:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Va shm_perm.cuid
and
.Va shm_perm.uid
are set to the effective uid of the calling process.
.It
.Va shm_perm.gid
and
.Va shm_perm.cgid
are set to the effective gid of the calling process.
.It
.Va shm_perm.mode
is set to the lower 9 bits of
.Fa shmflg .
.It
.Va shm_lpid ,
.Va shm_nattch ,
.Va shm_atime ,
and
.Va shm_dtime
are set to 0.
.It
.Va shm_ctime
is set to the current time.
.It
.Va shm_segsz
is set to the value of
.Fa size .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion a positive shared memory segment identifier is
returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
A shared memory segment is already associated with
.Fa key
and the caller has no permission to access it.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
Both
.Dv IPC_CREAT
and
.Dv IPC_EXCL
are set in
.Fa shmflg ,
and a shared memory segment is already associated with
.Fa key .
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
A new shared memory identifier could not be created because the system limit
for the number of shared memory identifiers has been reached.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
.Dv IPC_CREAT
was not set in
.Fa shmflg
and no shared memory segment associated with
.Fa key
was found.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There is not enough memory left to create a shared memory segment of the
requested size.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

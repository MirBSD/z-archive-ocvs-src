.Dt SETUID 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm setuid ,
.Nm seteuid ,
.Nm setgid ,
.Nm setegid
.Nd set user and group ID
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn setuid "uid_t uid"
.Ft int
.Fn seteuid "uid_t euid"
.Ft int
.Fn setgid "gid_t gid"
.Ft int
.Fn setegid "gid_t egid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setuid
function sets the real and effective user IDs and the saved set-user-ID
of the current process to the specified value.
The
.Fn setuid
function is permitted if the effective user ID is that of the superuser,
or if the specified user ID is the same as the effective user ID.
If not, but the specified user ID is the same as the real user ID,
.Fn setuid
will set the effective user ID to the real user ID.
.Pp
The
.Fn setgid
function sets the real and effective group IDs and the saved set-group-ID
of the current process to the specified value.
The
.Fn setgid
function is permitted if the effective user ID is that of the superuser,
or if the specified group ID is the same as the effective group ID.
If not, but the specified group ID is the same as the real group ID,
.Fn setgid
will set the effective group ID to the real group ID.
Supplementary group IDs remain unchanged.
.Pp
The
.Fn seteuid
function
.Pq Fn setegid
sets the effective user ID (group ID) of the current process.
The effective user ID may be set to the value
of the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID (see
.Xr intro 2
and
.Xr execve 2 ) ;
in this way, the effective user ID of a set-user-ID executable
may be toggled by switching to the real user ID, then re-enabled
by reverting to the set-user-ID value.
Similarly, the effective group ID may be set to the value
of the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon success, these functions return 0;
otherwise \-1 is returned.
.Pp
If the user is not the superuser, or the UID
specified is not the real, effective, or saved ID,
these functions return \-1.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getgid 2 ,
.Xr getuid 2 ,
.Xr issetugid 2 ,
.Xr setgroups 2
.Pp
A
.Fn setuid
function appeared in
.At v2 .
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn setuid
and
.Fn setgid
functions are compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-90
specification with
.Li _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
defined, with the extensions allowed in section B.4.2.2.
The
.Fn seteuid
and
.Fn setegid
functions are extensions based on the
.Tn POSIX
concept of
.Li _POSIX_SAVED_IDS ,
and have been proposed for a future revision of the standard.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Dd June 4, 1993
.Dt GETPGRP 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getpgrp
.Nd get process group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft pid_t
.Fn getpgrp "void"
.Ft pid_t
.Fn getpgid "pid_t pid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The process group of the current process is returned by
.Fn getpgrp .
The process group of the
.Fa pid
process is returned by
.Fn getpgid .
.Pp
Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and
by terminals to arbitrate requests for their input: processes
that have the same process group as the terminal are foreground
and may read, while others will block with a signal if they attempt
to read.
.Pp
This call is thus used by programs such as
.Xr csh 1
to create
process groups
in implementing job control.
The
.Fn tcgetpgrp
and
.Fn tcsetpgrp
calls
are used to get/set the process group of the control terminal.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getpgrp
always succeeds, however
.Fn getpgid
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process and the process
.Fa pid
are not in the same session.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
There is no process with a process ID equal to
.Fa pid .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setpgid 2 ,
.Xr termios 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getpgrp
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getpgrp
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
The
.Fn getpgid
function call is derived from its usage in System V Release 4, and
first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 a.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
This version of
.Fn getpgrp
differs from past Berkeley versions by not taking a
.Fa "pid_t pid"
argument.
This incompatibility is required by
.St -p1003.1-88 .
.Pp
From the
.St -p1003.1-88
Rationale:
.Pp
.Bx 4.3
provides a
.Fn getpgrp
function that returns the process group ID for a specified process.
Although this function is used to support job control, all known
job-control shells always specify the calling process with this
function.
Thus, the simpler System V
.Fn getpgrp
suffices, and the added complexity of the
.Bx 4.3
.Fn getpgrp
has been omitted from POSIX.1.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

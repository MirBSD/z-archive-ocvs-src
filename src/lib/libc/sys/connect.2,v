.Dd February 15, 1999
.Dt CONNECT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm connect
.Nd initiate a connection on a socket
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Ft int
.Fn connect "int s" "const struct sockaddr *name" "socklen_t namelen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The parameter
.Fa s
is a socket.
If it is of type
.Dv SOCK_DGRAM ,
this call specifies the peer with which the socket is to be associated;
this address is that to which datagrams are to be sent,
and the only address from which datagrams are to be received.
If the socket is of type
.Dv SOCK_STREAM ,
this call attempts to make a connection to
another socket.
The other socket is specified by
.Fa name ,
which is an address in the communications space of the socket.
.Fa namelen
indicates the amount of space pointed to by
.Fa name ,
in bytes.
Each communications space interprets the
.Fa name
parameter in its own way.
Generally, stream sockets may successfully
.Fn connect
only once; datagram sockets may use
.Fn connect
multiple times to change their association.
Datagram sockets may dissolve the association
by connecting to an invalid address, such as a null address.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the connection or binding succeeds, 0 is returned.
Otherwise a \-1 is returned, and a more specific error
code is stored in
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn connect
call fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa S
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
.Fa S
is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.
.It Bq Er EADDRNOTAVAIL
The specified address is not available on this machine.
.It Bq Er EAFNOSUPPORT
Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.
.It Bq Er EISCONN
The socket is already connected.
.It Bq Er ETIMEDOUT
Connection establishment timed out without establishing a connection.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A TCP connection with a local broadcast, the all-ones or a
multicast address as the peer was attempted.
.It Bq Er ECONNREFUSED
The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected.
.It Bq Er EHOSTUNREACH
The destination address specified an unreachable host.
.It Bq Er EINTR
A connect was interrupted before it succeeded
by the delivery of a signal.
.It Bq Er ENETUNREACH
The network isn't reachable from this host.
.It Bq Er EADDRINUSE
The address is already in use.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
parameter specifies an area outside
the process address space.
.It Bq Er EINPROGRESS
The socket is non-blocking
and the connection cannot
be completed immediately.
It is possible to
.Xr select 2
or
.Xr poll 2
for completion by selecting the socket for writing, and also use
.Xr getsockopt 2
with
.Dv SO_ERROR
to check for error conditions.
.It Bq Er EALREADY
The socket is non-blocking
and a previous connection attempt
has not yet been completed.
.It Bq Er EPERM
If TCP MD5SIG is being used and we don't get a properly authenticated
session up, for example if the peer is not configured for TCP MD5SIG
or the keys don't match.
.El
.Pp
The following errors are specific to connecting names in the UNIX domain.
These errors may not apply in future versions of the UNIX IPC domain.
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded
.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters, or an entire path name exceeded
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named socket does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Write access to the named socket is denied.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EPROTOTYPE
The file described by
.Fa name
is of a different type than
.Fa s .
E.g.,
.Fa s
may be of type
.Dv SOCK_STREAM
whereas
.Fa name
may refer to a socket of type
.Dv SOCK_DGRAM .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr accept 2 ,
.Xr getsockname 2 ,
.Xr getsockopt 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr socket 2
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn connect
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Dd June 4, 1993
.Dt KTRACE 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ktrace
.Nd process tracing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/uio.h>
.Fd #include <sys/ktrace.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ktrace "const char *tracefile" "int ops" "int trpoints" "pid_t pid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ktrace
function enables or disables tracing of one or more processes.
Users may only trace their own processes.
Only the superuser can trace setuid or setgid programs.
.Pp
.Fa tracefile
gives the pathname of the file to be used for tracing.
The file must exist, be writable by the calling process, and
not be a symbolic link.
All trace records are always appended to the file,
so the file must be truncated to zero length to discard
previous trace data.
If tracing points are being disabled (see
.Dv KTROP_CLEAR
below),
.Ar tracefile
may be
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The
.Fa ops
parameter specifies the requested ktrace operation.
The defined operations are:
.Bl -column KTRFLAG_DESCENDXXX -offset indent
.It Dv KTROP_SET	Enable trace points specified in Ar trpoints .
.It Dv KTROP_CLEAR	Disable trace points specified in Ar trpoints .
.It Dv KTROP_CLEARFILE	Stop all tracing.
.It Dv KTRFLAG_DESCEND	The tracing change should apply to the
specified process and all its current children.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa trpoints
parameter specifies the trace points of interest.
The defined trace points are:
.Bl -column KTRFAC_SYSCALLXXX -offset indent
.It Dv KTRFAC_SYSCALL	Trace system calls.
.It Dv KTRFAC_SYSRET	Trace return values from system calls.
.It Dv KTRFAC_NAMEI	Trace name lookup operations.
.It Dv KTRFAC_GENIO	Trace all I/O (note that this option can
generate much output).
.It Dv KTRFAC_PSIG	Trace posted signals.
.It Dv KTRFAC_EMUL	Trace emulation changes.
.It Dv KTRFAC_CSW	Trace context switch points.
.It Dv KTRFAC_INHERIT	Inherit tracing to future children.
.El
.Pp
Each tracing event outputs a record composed of a generic header
followed by a trace point specific structure.
The generic header is:
.Bd -literal
struct ktr_header {
	int	ktr_len;		/* length of buf */
	short	ktr_type;		/* trace record type */
	pid_t	ktr_pid;		/* process id */
	char	ktr_comm[MAXCOMLEN+1];	/* command name */
	struct	timeval ktr_time;	/* timestamp */
	caddr_t	ktr_buf;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa ktr_len
field specifies the length of the
.Fa ktr_type
data that follows this header.
The
.Fa ktr_pid
and
.Fa ktr_comm
fields specify the process and command generating the record.
The
.Fa ktr_time
field gives the time (with microsecond resolution)
that the record was generated.
The
.Fa ktr_buf
is an internal kernel pointer and is not useful.
.Pp
The generic header is followed by
.Fa ktr_len
bytes of a
.Fa ktr_type
record.
The type specific records are defined in the
.Aq Pa sys/ktrace.h
include file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to show the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn ktrace
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width ENAMETOOLONGAA
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named tracefile does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix or the
path refers to a symbolic link.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kdump 1 ,

A
.Fn ktrace
function call first appeared in

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Dt CLOCK_GETTIME 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm clock_gettime ,
.Nm clock_settime ,
.Nm clock_getres
.Nd get/set/calibrate date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/time.h>
.Ft int
.Fn clock_gettime "clockid_t clock_id" "struct timespec *tp"
.Ft int
.Fn clock_settime "clockid_t clock_id" "const struct timespec *tp"
.Ft int
.Fn clock_getres "clockid_t clock_id" "struct timespec *tp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn clock_gettime
and
.Fn clock_settime
allow the calling process to retrieve or set the value used by a clock
which is specified by
.Fa clock_id .
.Pp
.Fa clock_id
can be one of three values:
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME
for time that increments as
a wall clock should,
.Dv CLOCK_VIRTUAL
for time that increments only when
the CPU is running in user mode on behalf of the calling process, or
.Dv CLOCK_PROF
for time that increments when the CPU is running in user or kernel mode.
.Pp
The structure pointed to by
.Fa tp
is defined in
.Ao Pa sys/time.h Ac
as:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
struct timespec {
	time_t	tv_sec;		/* seconds */
	long	tv_nsec;	/* and nanoseconds */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Only the superuser may set the time of day.
If the system securelevel is greater than 1 (see
.Xr init 8 ) ,
the time may only be advanced.
This limitation is imposed to prevent a malicious superuser
from setting arbitrary time stamps on files.
The system time can still be adjusted backwards using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call even when the system is secure.
.Pp
The resolution (granularity) of a clock is returned by the
.Fn clock_getres
call.
This value is placed in a (non-null)
.Fa *tp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded.
A \-1 return value indicates an error occurred, and in this
case an error code is stored into the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width [EFAULT]
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa clock_id
was not a valid value.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa *tp
argument address referenced invalid memory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
A user other than the superuser attempted to set the time.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr date 1 ,
.Xr adjtime 2 ,
.Xr ctime 3 ,
.Xr timed 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn clock_gettime ,
.Fn clock_settime ,
and
.Fn clock_setres
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1b-93 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

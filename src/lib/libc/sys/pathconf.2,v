.Dd June 4, 1993
.Dt PATHCONF 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pathconf ,
.Nm fpathconf
.Nd get configurable pathname variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft long
.Fn pathconf "const char *path" "int name"
.Ft long
.Fn fpathconf "int fd" "int name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pathconf
and
.Fn fpathconf
functions provides a method for applications to determine the current
value of a configurable system limit or option variable associated
with a pathname or file descriptor.
.Pp
For
.Nm pathconf ,
the
.Fa path
argument is the name of a file or directory.
For
.Nm fpathconf ,
the
.Fa fd
argument is an open file descriptor.
The
.Fa name
argument specifies the system variable to be queried.
Symbolic constants for each name value are found in the include file
.Aq Pa unistd.h .
.Pp
The available values are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "123456"
.Pp
.It Dv _PC_LINK_MAX
The maximum file link count.
.It Dv _PC_MAX_CANON
The maximum number of bytes in a terminal canonical input line.
.It Dv _PC_MAX_INPUT
The maximum number of bytes for which space is available in
a terminal input queue.
.It Dv _PC_NAME_MAX
The maximum number of bytes in a file name.
.It Dv _PC_PATH_MAX
The maximum number of bytes in a pathname.
.It Dv _PC_PIPE_BUF
The maximum number of bytes which will be written atomically to a pipe.
.It Dv _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
Return 1 if appropriate privileges are required for the
.Xr chown 2
system call, otherwise 0.
.It Dv _PC_NO_TRUNC
Return 1 if file names longer than
.Dv KERN_NAME_MAX
are truncated.
.It Dv _PC_VDISABLE
Returns the terminal character disabling value.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Nm pathconf
or
.Nm fpathconf
is not successful, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
Otherwise, if the variable is associated with functionality that does
not have a limit in the system, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is not modified.
Otherwise, the current variable value is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Nm pathconf
and
.Nm fpathconf
functions shall return \-1 and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value.
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa name
argument is invalid.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The implementation does not support an association of the variable
name with the associated file.
.El
.Fn pathconf
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width ENAMETOOLONGAA
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.El
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width [EFAULT]
.Fn fpathconf
will fail if:
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm pathconf
and
.Nm fpathconf
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

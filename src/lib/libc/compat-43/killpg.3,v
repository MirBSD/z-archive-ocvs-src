.Sh NAME
.Nm killpg
.Nd send signal to a process group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <signal.h>
.Ft int
.Fn killpg "pid_t pgrp" "int sig"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn killpg
sends the signal
.Fa sig
to the process group
.Fa pgrp .
See
.Xr sigaction 2
for a list of signals.
If
.Fa pgrp
is 0,
.Fn killpg
sends the signal to the sending process's process group.
.Pp
The sending process and members of the process group must
have the same effective user ID, or
the sender must be the superuser.
As a single special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent
to any process that is a descendant of the current process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn killpg
will fail and no signal will be sent if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa sig
is not a valid signal number.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No process can be found in the process group specified by
.Fa pgrp .
.It Bq Er ESRCH
The process group was given as 0
but the sending process does not have a process group.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The sending process is not the superuser and one or more
of the target processes has an effective user ID different from that
of the sending process.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

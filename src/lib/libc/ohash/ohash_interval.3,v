.Sh NAME
.Nm ohash_interval ,
.Nm ohash_create_entry ,
.Nm ohash_qlookup ,
.Nm ohash_qlookupi
.Nd helper functions for open hashing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <stddef.h>
.Fd #include <ohash.h>
.Ft u_int32_t
.Fn ohash_interval "const char *start" "const char **pend"
.Ft "void *"
.Fn ohash_create_entry "struct ohash_info *info" "const char *start" "const char **pend"
.Ft "unsigned int"
.Fn ohash_qlookupi "struct ohash *h" "const char *start" "const char **pend"
.Ft "unsigned int"
.Fn ohash_qlookup "struct ohash *h" "const char *start"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are commonly used to simplify open hashing usage, and use
similar conventions.
They operate indifferently on null-terminated strings
.Po
by setting
.Fa *pend
=
.Dv NULL
.Pc
or memory ranges
.Po
deliminated by
.Fa start
and
.Fa *pend
.Pc .
For null-terminated strings, as a side effect, those functions
set
.Fa *pend
to the terminating null byte.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_interval
is a simple hashing function that yields good results on common data sets.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_create_entry
can be used to create a new record with a given key. In that case,
the alloc field of
.Fa info
should point to a
.Xr malloc 3
-like function to allocate the storage.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_qlookupi
is a wrapper function that simply calls
.Fn ohash_interval
and
.Fn ohash_lookup_interval .
.Pp
.Fn ohash_qlookup
is a variation on
.Fn ohash_qlookupi
designed for null-terminated strings.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ohash_init 3
.Sh STANDARDS
Those functions are completely non-standard and should be avoided in
portable programs.
.Sh HISTORY
Those functions were designed and written for
.Ox
make
by Marc Espie in 1999.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

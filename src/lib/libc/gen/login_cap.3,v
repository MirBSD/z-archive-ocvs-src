.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn login_getclass
function extracts the entry specified by
.Ar class
(or
.Li default
if
.Ar class
is
.Dv NULL
or the empty string) from
.Pa /etc/login.conf
(see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) .
If the entry is found, a
.Li login_cap_t
pointer is returned.
.Dv NULL
is returned if the user class is not found.
When the
.Li login_cap_t
structure is no longer needed, it should be freed by the
.Fn login_close
function.
.Pp
Once
.Ar lc
has been returned by
.Fn login_getclass ,
any of the other
.Fn login_*
functions may be called.
The
.Fn login_getstyle
function is used to obtain the style of authentication that should be used for
this user class.
The
.Ar style
argument may either be
.Dv NULL
or the desired style of authentication.
If
.Dv NULL ,
the first available authentication style will be used.
The
.Ar type
argument refers to the type of authentication being performed.
This is used to override the standard
.Li auth
entry in the database.
By convention this should be of the form "auth-type".
Future releases may remove the requirement for the "auth-" prefix and add
it if it is missing.
If
.Ar type
is
.Dv NULL
then only "auth" will be looked at.
(See
.Xr login.conf 5 ) .
The
.Fn login_getstyle
function will return
.Dv NULL
if the desired style of authentication is not available,
or if no style is available.
.Pp
The
.Fn login_getcapnum ,
.Fn login_getcapsize ,
.Fn login_getcapstr ,
and
.Fn login_getcaptime
functions all query the database entry for a field named
.Ar cap .
If the field is found, its value is returned.
If the field is not found, the value specified by
.Ar def
is returned.
If an error is encountered while trying to find the field,
.Ar err
is returned.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for a discussion of the various textual forms the value may take.
The
.Fn login_getcapbool
function is slightly different.
It returns
.Ar def
if no capabilities were found for this class (typically meaning that
the default class was used and the
.Li /etc/login.conf
file is missing).
It returns a non-zero value if
.Ar cap ,
with no value, was found,
zero otherwise.
.Pp
The
.Fn secure_path
function takes a path name and returns 0 if the path name is secure, \-1
if not.
To be secure a path must exist, be a regular file (and not a directory),
owned by root, and only writable by the owner (root).
.Pp
The
.Fn setclasscontext
function takes
.Ar class ,
the name of a user class, and sets the resources defined by that
class according to
.Ar flags.
Only the
.Dv LOGIN_SETPATH ,
.Dv LOGIN_SETPRIORITY ,
.Dv LOGIN_SETRESOURCES ,
and
.Dv LOGIN_SETUMASK
bits are used.
(See
.Fn setusercontext
below).
It returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn setusercontext
function sets the resources according to
.Ar flags .
The
.Ar lc
argument, if not
.Dv NULL ,
contains the class information that should be used.
The
.Ar pwd
argument, if not
.Dv NULL ,
provides information about the user.
Both
.Ar lc
and
.Ar pwd
cannot be
.Dv NULL .
The
.Ar uid
argument is used in place of the user ID contained in the
.Ar pwd
structure when calling
.Xr setuid 2 .
The
.Fn setusercontext
function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
The various bits available to be or-ed together to make up
.Ar flags
are:
.Bl -tag -width LOGIN_SETRESOURCESXX
.It Dv LOGIN_SETGROUP
Set the group id and call
.Xr initgroups 3 .
Requires the
.Ar pwd
field be specified.
.It Dv LOGIN_SETLOGIN
Sets the login name by
.Xr setlogin 2 .
Requires the
.Ar pwd
field be specified.
.It Dv LOGIN_SETPATH
Sets the
.Ev PATH
environment variable.
.It Dv LOGIN_SETPRIORITY
Sets the priority by
.Xr setpriority 2 .
.It Dv LOGIN_SETRESOURCES
Sets the various system resources by
.Xr setrlimit 2 .
.It Dv LOGIN_SETUMASK
Sets the umask by
.Xr umask 2 .
.It Dv LOGIN_SETUSER
Sets the user ID to
.Ar uid
by
.Xr setuid 2 .
.It Dv LOGIN_SETALL
Sets all of the above.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setlogin 2 ,
.Xr setpriority 2 ,

.Xr umask 2 ,

.Xr login.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function first appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The string returned by
.Fn login_getcapstr
is allocated via
.Xr malloc 3
when the specified capability is present and thus it is the responsibility
of the caller to
.Fn free
this space.
However, if the capability was not found or an error occurred and
.Fa def
or
.Fa err
(whichever is relevant) are non-NULL the returned value is simply what
was passed in to
.Fn login_getcapstr .
Therefore it is not possible to blindly
.Fn free
the return value without first checking it against
.Fa def
and
.Fa err .
.Pp
The same warnings set forth in
.Xr setlogin 2
apply to
.Fn setusercontext
when the
.Dv LOGIN_SETLOGIN
flag is used.
Specifically, changing the login name affects all processes in the current
session, not just the current process.
See
.Xr setlogin 2
for more information.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not

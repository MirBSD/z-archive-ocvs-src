.Dt SYSCONF 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysconf
.Nd get configurable system variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft long
.Fn sysconf "int name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This interface is defined by
.St -p1003.1-88 .
A far more complete interface is available using
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn sysconf
function provides a method for applications to determine the current
value of a configurable system limit or option variable.
The
.Fa name
argument specifies the system variable to be queried.
Symbolic constants for each name value are found in the include file
.Li <unistd.h> .
.Pp
The available values are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "123456"
.Pp
.It Li _SC_ARG_MAX
The maximum bytes of arguments to
.Xr exec 3
(including the environment).
.It Li _SC_CHILD_MAX
The maximum number of simultaneous processes per user id.
.It Li _SC_CLK_TCK
The number of clock ticks per second.
.It Li _SC_NGROUPS_MAX
The maximum number of supplemental groups.
.It Li _SC_OPEN_MAX
The maximum number of open files per user id.
.It Li _SC_STREAM_MAX
The minimum maximum number of streams that a process may have open
at any one time.
.It Li _SC_TZNAME_MAX
The minimum maximum number of types supported for the name of a
timezone.
.It Li _SC_JOB_CONTROL
Returns 1 if job control is available on this system, otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_SAVED_IDS
Returns 1 if saved set-group-ID and saved set-user-ID is available,
otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_VERSION
The version of ISO/IEC 9945 (POSIX 1003.1) with which the system
attempts to comply.
.It Li _SC_BC_BASE_MAX
The maximum ibase/obase values in the
.Xr bc 1
utility.
.It Li _SC_BC_DIM_MAX
The maximum array size in the
.Xr bc 1
utility.
.It Li _SC_BC_SCALE_MAX
The maximum scale value in the
.Xr bc 1
utility.
.It Li _SC_BC_STRING_MAX
The maximum string length in the
.Xr bc 1
utility.
.It Li _SC_COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX
The maximum number of weights that can be assigned to any entry of
the LC_COLLATE order keyword in the locale definition file.
.It Li _SC_EXPR_NEST_MAX
The maximum number of expressions that can be nested within
parenthesis by the
.Xr expr 1
utility.
.It Li _SC_LINE_MAX
The maximum length in bytes of a text-processing utility's input
line.
.It Li _SC_RE_DUP_MAX
The maximum number of repeated occurrences of a regular expression
permitted when using interval notation.
.It Li _SC_2_VERSION
The version of POSIX 1003.2 with which the system attempts to comply.
.It Li _SC_2_C_BIND
Return 1 if the system's C-language development facilities support the
C-Language Bindings Option, otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_C_DEV
Return 1 if the system supports the C-Language Development Utilities Option,
otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_CHAR_TERM
Return 1 if the system supports at least one terminal type capable of
all operations described in POSIX 1003.2, otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_FORT_DEV
Return 1 if the system supports the FORTRAN Development Utilities Option,
otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_FORT_RUN
Return 1 if the system supports the FORTRAN Runtime Utilities Option,
otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_LOCALEDEF
Return 1 if the system supports the creation of locales, otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_SW_DEV
Return 1 if the system supports the Software Development Utilities Option,
otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_2_UPE
Return 1 if the system supports the User Portability Utilities Option,
otherwise \-1.
.It Li _SC_PAGESIZE
The size of a system page in bytes.
.It Li _SC_FSYNC
Return 1 if the system supports the File Synchronisation Option, otherwise \-1.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Fn sysconf
is not successful, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
Otherwise, if the variable is associated with functionality that is not
supported, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is not modified.
Otherwise, the current variable value is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sysconf
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library functions
.Xr sysctl 3 .
In addition, the following error may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa name
argument is invalid.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh BUGS
The value for _SC_STREAM_MAX is a minimum maximum, and required to be
the same as ANSI C's FOPEN_MAX, so the returned value is a ridiculously
small and misleading number.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn sysconf
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn sysconf
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

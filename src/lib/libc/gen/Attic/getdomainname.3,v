.Dt GETDOMAINNAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getdomainname ,
.Nm setdomainname
.Nd get/set domain name of current host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getdomainname "char *name" "size_t namelen"
.Ft int
.Fn setdomainname "const char *name" "size_t namelen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getdomainname
function returns the domain name for the current processor, as
previously set by
.Fn setdomainname .
The parameter
.Fa namelen
specifies the size of the
.Fa name
array.
If insufficient space is provided, the returned name is truncated.
The returned name is always null terminated.
.Pp
.Fn setdomainname
sets the domain name of the host machine to be
.Fa name ,
which has length
.Fa namelen .
This call is restricted to the superuser and
is normally used only when the system is bootstrapped.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call succeeds a value of 0 is returned.
If the call fails, a value of \-1 is returned and an error code is
placed in the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The following errors may be returned by these calls:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
or
.Fa namelen
parameter gave an
invalid address.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The caller tried to set the domain name and was not the superuser.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr domainname 1 ,
.Xr gethostid 3 ,
.Xr gethostname 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr yp 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function call appeared in
SunOS 3.x.
.Sh BUGS
Domain names are limited to
.Dv MAXHOSTNAMELEN
(from
.Ao Pa sys/param.h Ac )
characters, currently 256.
This includes the terminating NUL character.
.Pp
If the buffer passed to
.Fn getdomainname
is too small, other operating systems may not guarantee termination with NUL.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm fpgetmask ,
.Nm fpgetround ,

.Nm fpsetmask ,
.Nm fpsetround ,
.Nm fpsetsticky
.Nd IEEE FP mode control

.Ft fp_except
.Fn fpgetmask void
.Ft fp_rnd
.Fn fpgetround void
.Ft fp_except
.Fn fpgetsticky void
.Ft fp_except
.Fn fpsetmask fp_except\ mask
.Ft fp_rnd
.Fn fpsetround fp_rnd\ rnd_dir
.Ft fp_except
.Fn fpsetsticky fp_except\ sticky
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A rounding mode is one of
.Dv FP_RZ , FP_RM , FP_RN ,
or
.Dv FP_RP ,
for rounding towards zero, rounding
.Pq Em Minus infinity
down, rounding to
.Em nearest ,
and rounding
.Pq Em Plus infinity
up.
The default mode is
.Dv FP_RN .
.Pp
An
.Ft fp_except
value is a bitmask specifying an exception type and containing any of
the values listed below.
.Bl -column -offset indent FP_X_UFLxx
.It Dv FP_X_INV Ta Invalid\ Operation
.It Dv FP_X_DZ Ta Division\ by\ zero
.It Dv FP_X_OFL Ta Overflow
.It Dv FP_X_UFL Ta Underflow
.It Dv FP_X_IMP Ta Imprecision (inexact)
.It Dv FP_X_IOV Ta Integer\ Overflow
.El
.Pp
.Pp
The
.Fn fpsetmask
function will cause future operations with the specified result status to
raise the
.Dv SIGFPE
exception.
The
.Fn fpsetround
function will cause future operations to use the specified dynamic mode.
.Bl -tag -width Note:x
.It Em Note :
On some architectures, instructions can optionally specify static
rounding modes and exception enables that will supersede the specified
dynamic mode.
On other architectures, these features may not be fully supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn fpsetsticky
function will set or clear the specified exception history bits.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn fpgetround
and
.Fn fpsetround
functions return the
.Pq previous
rounding mode.
The
.Fn fpgetmask ,
.Fn fpsetmask ,
.Fn fpgetsticky ,
and
.Fn fpsetsticky
functions return the
.Pq previous
exception mask and exception history bits.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

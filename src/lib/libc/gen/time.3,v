.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm time
.Nd get time of day
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <time.h>
.Ft time_t
.Fn time "time_t *tloc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn time
function returns the value of time in seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes,
0 seconds, January 1, 1970 ("the Epoch"), Temps Atomique International
(TAI), counting leap seconds.
.Pp
A copy of the time value may be saved to the area indicated by the
pointer
.Fa tloc .
If
.Fa tloc
is a null pointer, no value is stored.
.Pp
Upon successful completion,
.Fn time
returns the value of time.
Otherwise a value of
.Po Fa time_t Pc Ns -1
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An argument address referenced invalid memory.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gettimeofday 2 ,
.Xr ctime 3
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn time
function appeared in
.At v2
and used to return time in sixtieths of a second in 32 bits,
which was to guarantee a crisis every 2.26 years.
Since the
.At v6
.Fn time
scale was changed to seconds extending the pre-crisis stagnation
period up to a total of 68 years.
.Pp
On
.Mx ,
the value equals the kernel time, or the result of
.Xr gettimeofday 2
with no timezone information provided.
Counting leap seconds, instead of jumping over them, while
calculating the result, violates POSIX, but is the only way
to get legal and lawful time.
.Pp
Since
.Mx 8 ,
the
.Ft time_t
type has been extended to 64 bit in order to prevent
the year 2036 and 2038 crisises.

1.2
log
@Correct blatant ignoring the NULL constant for zero pointers,
and change UTC to TAI because we _do_ count leap seconds.
Also, our epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:10 UTC/TAI.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Dd December 7, 2001
.Dt READPASSPHRASE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm readpassphrase
.Nd get a passphrase from the user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <readpassphrase.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn readpassphrase "const char *prompt" "char *buf" "size_t bufsiz" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function displays a prompt to, and reads in a passphrase from,
.Pa /dev/tty .
If this file is inaccessible
and the
.Dv RPP_REQUIRE_TTY
flag is not set,
.Fn readpassphrase
displays the prompt on the standard error output and reads from the standard
input.
In this case it is generally not possible to turn off echo.
.Pp
Up to
.Fa bufsiz
- 1 characters (one is for the NUL) are read into the provided buffer
.Fa buf .
Any additional
characters and the terminating newline (or return) character are discarded.
.Pp
.Fn readpassphrase
takes the following optional
.Fa flags :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
RPP_ECHO_OFF		turn off echo (default behavior)
RPP_ECHO_ON		leave echo on
RPP_REQUIRE_TTY		fail if there is no tty
RPP_FORCELOWER		force input to lower case
RPP_FORCEUPPER		force input to upper case
RPP_SEVENBIT		strip the high bit from input
RPP_STDIN		force read of passphrase from stdin
.Ed
.Pp
The calling process should zero the passphrase as soon as possible to
avoid leaving the cleartext passphrase visible in the process's address
space.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn readpassphrase
returns a pointer to the null-terminated passphrase.
If an error is encountered, the terminal state is restored and
a null pointer is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINTR
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function was interrupted by a signal.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Ar bufsiz
argument was zero.
.It Bq Er EIO
The process is a member of a background process attempting to read
from its controlling terminal, the process is ignoring or blocking
the SIGTTIN signal or the process group is orphaned.
.It Bq Er EMFILE
The process has already reached its limit for open file descriptors.
.It Bq Er ENFILE
The system file table is full.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
There is no controlling terminal and the
.Dv RPP_REQUIRE_TTY
flag was specified.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment will read a passphrase from
.Pa /dev/tty
into the buffer
.Fa passbuf.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char passbuf[1024];

\&...

if (readpassphrase("Response: ", passbuf, sizeof(passbuf),
    RPP_REQUIRE_TTY) == NULL)
	errx(1, "unable to read passphrase");

if (compare(transform(passbuf), epass) != 0)
	errx(1, "bad passphrase");

\&...

memset(passbuf, 0, sizeof(passbuf));
.Ed
.Sh SIGNALS
.Fn readpassphrase
will catch the following signals:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
SIGALRM
SIGHUP
SIGINT
SIGPIPE
SIGQUIT
SIGTERM
SIGTSTP
SIGTTIN
SIGTTOU
.Ed
.Pp
When one of the above signals is intercepted, terminal echo will
be restored if it had previously been turned off.
If a signal handler was installed for the signal when
.Fn readpassphrase
was called that handler is then executed.
If no handler was previously installed for the signal then the
default action is taken as per
.Xr sigaction 2 .
.Pp
The
.Dv SIGTSTP ,
.Dv SIGTTIN ,
.Dv SIGTTOU ,
signals (stop signal generated from keyboard or due to terminal I/O
from a background proccess) are treated specially.
When the process is resumed after it has been stopped,
.Fn readpassphrase
will reprint the prompt and the user may then enter a passphrase.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/tty -compact
.It Pa /dev/tty
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr getpass 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function is an
.Ox
extension and should not be used if portability is desired.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn readpassphrase
function first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.5
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

.Dt GETTTYENT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getttyent ,
.Nm getttynam ,
.Nm setttyent ,
.Nm endttyent
.Nd get ttys file entry
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <ttyent.h>
.Ft struct ttyent *
.Fn getttyent "void"
.Ft struct ttyent *
.Fn getttynam "const char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn setttyent "void"
.Ft int
.Fn endttyent "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getttyent
and
.Fn getttynam
functions each return a pointer to an object, with the following structure,
containing the broken-out fields of a line from the tty description file.
.Bd -literal
struct ttyent {
	char	*ty_name;	/* terminal device name */
	char	*ty_getty;	/* command to execute */
	char	*ty_type;	/* terminal type */
#define	TTY_ON		0x01	/* enable logins */
#define	TTY_SECURE	0x02	/* allow uid of 0 to login */
#define	TTY_LOCAL	0x04	/* set 'CLOCAL' on open (dev. specific) */
#define	TTY_RTSCTS	0x08	/* set 'CRTSCTS' on open (dev. specific) */
#define	TTY_SOFTCAR	0x10	/* ignore hardware carrier (dev. spec.) */
#define	TTY_MDMBUF	0x20	/* set 'MDMBUF' on open (dev. specific) */
	int	ty_status;	/* flag values */
	char	*ty_window;	/* command for window manager */
	char	*ty_comment;	/* comment field */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The fields are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ty_comment
.It Fa ty_name
Name of the character-special file.
.It Fa ty_getty
Name of the command invoked by
.Xr init 8
to initialize tty line characteristics.
.It Fa ty_type
Name of the default terminal type connected to this tty line.
.It Fa ty_status
A mask of bit fields which indicate various actions allowed on this
tty line.
The possible flags are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width TTY_SOFTCAR
.It Dv TTY_ON
Enables logins (i.e.,
.Xr init 8
will start the command referenced by
.Fa ty_getty
on this entry).
.It Dv TTY_SECURE
Allow users with a UID of 0 to login on this terminal.
.It Dv TTY_LOCAL
If the terminal port's driver supports it, cause the line to be treated as
.Dq local .
.It Dv TTY_MDMBUF
If the terminal port's driver supports it, use
DTR/DCD hardware flow control on the line by default.
.It Dv TTY_RTSCTS
If the terminal port's driver supports it, use
full-duplex RTS/CTS hardware flow control on the line by default.
.It Dv TTY_SOFTCAR
If the terminal port's driver supports it, ignore hardware
carrier on the line.
.El
.It Fa ty_window
Command to execute for a window system associated with the line.
.It Fa ty_comment
Any trailing comment field, with any leading hash marks
.Pq Sq \&#
or whitespace removed.
.El
.Pp
If any of the fields pointing to character strings are unspecified,
they are returned as null pointers.
The field
.Fa ty_status
will be zero if no flag values are specified.
.Pp
See
.Xr ttys 5
for a more complete discussion of the meaning and usage of the
fields.
.Pp
The
.Fn getttyent
function reads the next line from the ttys file, opening the file if necessary.
.Fn setttyent
rewinds the file if open, or opens the file if it is unopened.
.Fn endttyent
closes any open files.
.Pp
.Fn getttynam
searches from the beginning of the file until a matching
.Fa name
is found (or until
.Dv EOF
is encountered).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The routines
.Fn getttyent
and
.Fn getttynam
return a null pointer on
.Dv EOF
or error.
The
.Fn setttyent
function and
.Fn endttyent
return 0 on failure or 1 on success.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/ttys -compact
.It Pa /etc/ttys
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr ttyslot 3 ,
.Xr gettytab 5 ,
.Xr termcap 5 ,
.Xr ttys 5 ,
.Xr getty 8 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr ttyflags 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getttyent ,
.Fn getttynam ,
.Fn setttyent ,
and
.Fn endttyent
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
These functions use static data storage; if the data is needed for future use,
it should be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

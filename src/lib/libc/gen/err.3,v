.Fn err "int eval" "const char *fmt" "..."
.Ft void
.Fn verr "int eval" "const char *fmt" "va_list args"

.Ft void
.Fn warnx "const char *fmt" "..."
.Ft void
.Fn vwarnx "const char *fmt" "va_list args"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn err
and
.Fn warn
family of functions display a formatted error message on the standard
error output.
In all cases, the last component of the program name, followed by
a colon
.Pq Sq \&:
character and a space, are output.
The text that follows depends on the function being called.
The
.Fa fmt
specification (and associated arguments) may be any format allowed by
.Xr printf 3 ,
a simple string, or
.Dv NULL .
If the
.Fa fmt
argument is not
.Dv NULL ,
the formatted error message is output.
.Pp
In the case of the
.Fn err ,
.Fn verr ,
.Fn warn ,
and
.Fn vwarn
functions only, the error message string affiliated with the current value of
the global variable
.Va errno
is output (see
.Xr strerror 3 ) ,
preceded by a colon character and a space if
.Fa fmt
is not
.Dv NULL .
That is, the output is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
progname: fmt: error message string
.Ed
.Pp
if
.Fa fmt
is not
.Dv NULL ,
or:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
progname: error message string
.Ed
.Pp
if it is.
.Pp
The counterpart functions,
.Fn errx ,
.Fn verrx ,
.Fn warnx ,
and
.Fn vwarnx ,
do not output the error message string, so the output looks like the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
progname: fmt
.Ed
.Pp
In all cases, the output is followed by a newline character.
.Pp
The
.Fn err ,
.Fn verr ,
.Fn errx ,
and
.Fn verrx
functions do not return, but exit with the value of the argument
.Fa eval .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Display the current
.Va errno
information string and exit:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if ((p = malloc(size)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
if ((fd = open(file_name, O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
	err(1, "%s", file_name);
.Ed
.Pp
Display an error message and exit:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if (tm.tm_hour < START_TIME)
	errx(1, "too early, wait until %s", start_time_string);
.Ed
.Pp
Warn of an error:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if ((fd = open(raw_device, O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
	warnx("%s: %s: trying the block device",
	    raw_device, strerror(errno));
if ((fd = open(block_device, O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
	err(1, "%s", block_device);
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr exit 3 ,
.Xr perror 3 ,
.Xr printf 3 ,
.Xr strerror 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn err
and
.Fn warn
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
It is important never to pass a string with user-supplied data as a
format without using
.Ql %s .
An attacker can put format specifiers in the string to mangle your stack,
leading to a possible security hole.
This holds true even if you have built the string
.Dq by hand
using a function like
.Fn snprintf ,
as the resulting string may still contain user-supplied conversion specifiers
for later interpolation by the
.Fn err
and
.Fn warn
functions.
.Pp
Always be sure to use the proper secure idiom:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
err(1, "%s", string);

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm net_addrcmp
.Nd compare socket address structures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <netdb.h>
.Ft int
.Fn net_addrcmp "struct sockaddr *sa1" "struct sockaddr *sa2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn net_addrcmp
function compares two socket address structures,
.Fa sa1
and
.Fa sa2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fa sa1
and
.Fa sa2
are for the same address,
.Fn net_addrcmp
returns 0.
.Pp
The
.Fa sa_len
fields are compared first.
If they do not match,
.Fn net_addrcmp
returns \-1 or 1 if
.Li sa1->sa_len
is less than or greater than
.Li sa2->sa_len ,
respectively.
.Pp
Next, the
.Fa sa_family
members are compared.
If they do not match,
.Fn net_addrcmp
returns \-1 or 1 if
.Li sa1->sa_family
is less than or greater than
.Li sa2->sa_family ,
respectively.
.Pp
Lastly, if each socket address structure's
.Fa sa_len
and
.Fa sa_family
fields match,
the protocol-specific data (the
.Fa sa_data
field) is compared.
If there's a match, both
.Fa sa1
and
.Fa sa2
must refer to the same address, and 0 is returned; otherwise, a value >0
or <0 is returned.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn net_addrcmp
function was added in
.Ox 2.5 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

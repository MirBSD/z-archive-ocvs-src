.Dt IPX 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ipx_addr ,
.Nm ipx_ntoa
.Nd IPX address conversion routines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <netipx/ipx.h>
.Ft struct ipx_addr
.Fn ipx_addr "const char *cp"
.Ft char *
.Fn ipx_ntoa "struct ipx_addr ipx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The routine
.Fn ipx_addr
interprets character strings representing
.Tn IPX
addresses, returning binary information suitable
for use in system calls.
The routine
.Fn ipx_ntoa
takes
.Tn IPX
addresses and returns
.Tn ASCII
strings representing the address in a
notation in common use:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
<network number>.<host number>.<port number>
.Ed
.Pp
Trailing zero fields are suppressed, and each number is printed in hexadecimal,
in a format suitable for input to
.Fn ipx_addr .
Any fields lacking super-decimal digits will have a
trailing
.Sq H
appended.
.Pp
An effort has been made to ensure that
.Fn ipx_addr
be compatible with most formats in common use.
It will first separate an address into 1 to 3 fields using a single delimiter
chosen from
period
.Pq Ql \&. ,
colon
.Pq Ql \&: ,
or pound-sign
.Pq Ql # .
Each field is then examined for byte separators (colon or period).
If there are byte separators, each subfield separated is taken to be
a small hexadecimal number, and the entirety is taken as a network-byte-ordered
quantity to be zero extended in the high-network-order bytes.
Next, the field is inspected for hyphens, in which case
the field is assumed to be a number in decimal notation
with hyphens separating the millenia.
Next, the field is assumed to be a number:
It is interpreted
as hexadecimal if there is a leading
.Ql 0x
(as in C),
a trailing
.Sq H
(as in Mesa), or there are any super-decimal digits present.
It is interpreted as octal is there is a leading
.Ql 0
and there are no super-octal digits.
Otherwise, it is converted as a decimal number.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
None.
(See
.Sx BUGS . )
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ns 4 ,
.Xr hosts 5 ,
.Xr networks 5
.Sh HISTORY
The precursor
.Fn ns_addr
and
.Fn ns_ntoa
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The string returned by
.Fn ipx_ntoa
resides in a static memory area.
The function
.Fn ipx_addr
should diagnose improperly formed input, and there should be an unambiguous
way to recognize this.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getnetent ,
.Nm getnetbyaddr ,
.Nm getnetbyname ,
.Nm setnetent ,
.Nm endnetent
.Nd get network entry
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <netdb.h>
.Ft struct netent *
.Fn getnetent "void"
.Ft struct netent *
.Fn getnetbyname "char *name"
.Ft struct netent *
.Fn getnetbyaddr "in_addr_t net" "int type"
.Ft void
.Fn setnetent "int stayopen"
.Ft void
.Fn endnetent "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getnetent ,
.Fn getnetbyname ,
and
.Fn getnetbyaddr
functions each return a pointer to an object with the following structure
containing the broken-out fields of a line in the network database,
.Pa /etc/networks .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct	netent {
	char		*n_name;	/* official name of net */
	char		**n_aliases;	/* alias list */
	int		n_addrtype;	/* net number type */
	in_addr_t	n_net;		/* net number */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The members of this structure are:
.Bl -tag -width n_addrtype
.It Fa n_name
The official name of the network.
.It Fa n_aliases
A zero-terminated list of alternate names for the network.
.It Fa n_addrtype
The type of the network number returned; currently only
.Dv AF_INET .
.It Fa n_net
The network number.
Network numbers are returned in machine byte order.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn getnetent
function reads the next line of the file, opening the file if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Fn setnetent
function opens and rewinds the file.
If the
.Fa stayopen
flag is non-zero,
the net database will not be closed after each call to
.Fn getnetbyname
or
.Fn getnetbyaddr .
.Pp
The
.Fn endnetent
function closes the file.
.Pp
The
.Fn getnetbyname
and
.Fn getnetbyaddr
functions search the domain name server if the system is configured to use one.
If the search fails, or no name server is configured, they sequentially
search from the beginning of the file until a matching net name or
net address and type is found, or until
.Dv EOF
is encountered.
Network numbers are supplied in host order.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/networks -compact
.It Pa /etc/networks
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Null pointer (0) returned on
.Dv EOF
or error.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr resolver 3 ,
.Xr networks 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getnetent ,
.Fn getnetbyaddr ,
.Fn getnetbyname ,
.Fn setnetent ,
and
.Fn endnetent
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The data space used by these functions is static; if future use
requires the data, it should be copied before any subsequent calls
to these functions overwrite it.
Only Internet network numbers are currently understood.
Expecting network numbers to fit in no more than 32 bits is naive.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

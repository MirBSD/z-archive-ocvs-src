.Sh NAME
.Nm strftime
.Nd format date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <time.h>
.Ft size_t
.Fn strftime "char *buf" "size_t maxsize" "const char *format" "const struct tm *timeptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strftime
function formats the information from
.Fa timeptr
into the buffer
.Fa buf
according to the string pointed to by
.Fa format .
.Pp
The
.Fa format
string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and
ordinary characters.
All ordinary characters are copied directly into the buffer.
A conversion specification consists of a percent sign
.Ql %
and one other character.
.Pp
No more than
.Fa maxsize
characters will be placed into the array.
If the total number of resulting characters, including the terminating
NUL character, is not more than
.Fa maxsize ,
.Fn strftime
returns the number of characters in the array, not counting the
terminating NUL.
Otherwise, zero is returned.
.Pp
Each conversion specification is replaced by the characters as
follows which are then copied into the buffer.
.Bl -tag -width "xxxx"
.It Cm \&%A
is replaced by the locale's full weekday name.
.It Cm \&%a
is replaced by the locale's abbreviated weekday name.
.It Cm \&%B
is replaced by the locale's full month name.
.It Cm \&%b No or Cm \&%h
is replaced by the locale's abbreviated month name.
.It Cm \&%C
is replaced by the century (a year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer)
as a decimal number (00-99).
.It Cm \&%c
is replaced by the locale's appropriate date and time representation.
.It Cm \&%D
is replaced by the date in the format
.Dq Li %m/%d/%y .
.It Cm \&%d
is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31).
.It Cm \&%e
is replaced by the day of month as a decimal number (1-31);
single digits are preceded by a blank.
.It Cm \&%F
is replaced by the date in the format
.Dq Li %Y-%m-%d .
.It Cm \&%G
is replaced by the ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number.
.It Cm \&%g
is replaced by the ISO 8601 year without century as a decimal number (00-99).
.It Cm \&%H
is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23).
.It Cm \&%I
is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (01-12).
.It Cm \&%j
is replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366).
.It Cm \&%k
is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0-23);
single digits are preceded by a blank.
.It Cm \&%l
is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1-12);
single digits are preceded by a blank.
.It Cm \&%M
is replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59).
.It Cm %m
is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12).
.It Cm %n
is replaced by a newline.
.It Cm %p
is replaced by the locale's equivalent of either
.Dq Tn AM
or
.Dq Tn PM .
.It Cm \&%R
is replaced by the time in the format
.Dq Li %H:%M .
.It Cm \&%r
is replaced by the locale's representation of 12-hour clock time
using AM/PM notation.
.It Cm \&%S
is replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-61).
The range of
seconds is (00-61) instead of (00-59) to allow for the periodic occurrence
of leap seconds and double leap seconds.
.It Cm %s
is replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC (see
.Xr mktime 3 ) .
.It Cm \&%T
is replaced by the time in the format
.Dq Li %H:%M:%S .
.It Cm \&%t
is replaced by a tab.
.It Cm \&%U
is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of
the week) as a decimal number (00-53).
.It Cm \&%u
is replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the week)
as a decimal number (1-7).
.It Cm \&%V
is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
the week) as a decimal number (01-53).
If the week containing January
1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise
it is week 53 of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.
.It Cm \&%W
is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
the week) as a decimal number (00-53).
.It Cm \&%w
is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week)
as a decimal number (0-6).
.It Cm \&%X
is replaced by the locale's appropriate time representation.
.It Cm \&%x
is replaced by the locale's appropriate date representation.
.It Cm \&%Y
is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.
.It Cm \&%y
is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number (00-99).
.It Cm \&%Z
is replaced by the time zone name,
or by the empty string if this is not determinable.
.It Cm \&%z
is replaced by the offset from UTC in the format
.Dq Li +HHMM
or
.Dq Li -HHMM
as appropriate, with positive values representing locations east
of Greenwich, or by the empty string if this is not determinable.
.It Cm %%
is replaced by
.Ql % .
.It Cm %+
is replaced by the date and time in
.Xr date 1
format.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strftime
function
conforms to
.St -ansiC .
.Pp
The
.Ql \&%G ,
.Ql \&%g ,
.Ql \&%k ,
.Ql \&%l ,
.Ql \&%s ,
and
.Ql \&%+
conversion specifications are extensions.
.Pp
Use of the ISO 8601 conversions may produce non-intuitive results.
Week 01 of a year is per definition the first week which has the Thursday
in this year, which is equivalent to the week which contains the fourth
day of January.
In other words, the first week of a new year is the week which has the
majority of its days in the new year.
Week 01 might also contain days from the previous year and the week
before week 01 of a year is the last week (52 or 53) of the previous
year even if it contains days from the new year.
A week starts with Monday (day 1) and ends with Sunday (day 7).
For example, the first week of the year 1997 lasts from
1996-12-30 to 1997-01-05.
.Sh BUGS
There is no conversion specification for the phase of the moon.
.Pp
Note that while this implementation of
.Fn strftime
will always NUL terminate
.Fa buf ,
other implementations may not do so when
.Fa maxsiz
is not large enough to store the entire time string.
The contents of
.Fa buf
are implementation specific in this case.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

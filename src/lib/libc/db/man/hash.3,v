.Dt HASH 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hash
.Nd hash database access method
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <db.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The routine
.Fn dbopen
is the library interface to database files.
One of the supported file formats is hash files.
The general description of the database access methods is in
.Xr dbopen 3 .
This manual page describes only the hash specific information.
.Pp
The hash data structure is an extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
.Pp
The access method specific data structure provided to
.Fn dbopen
is defined in the
.Aq Pa db.h
include file as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
typedef struct {
.It
.Bl -item -compact -inset -offset indent
.It
u_int bsize;
.It
u_int ffactor;
.It
u_int nelem;
.It
u_int cachesize;
.It
u_int32_t (*hash)(const void *, size_t);
.It
int lorder;
.El
.It
} HASHINFO;
.El
.Pp
The elements of this structure are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -offset indent
.It Fa bsize
.Fa bsize
defines the hash table bucket size, and is, by default,
the block size of the underlying filesystem.
It may be preferable to increase the page size for disk-resident tables
and tables with large data items.
.It Fa ffactor
.Fa ffactor
indicates a desired density within the hash table.
It is an approximation of the number of keys allowed to accumulate in any
one bucket, determining when the hash table grows or shrinks.
The default value is the same as
.Fa bsize .
.It Fa nelem
.Fa nelem
is an estimate of the final size of the hash table.
If not set or set too low, hash tables will expand gracefully as keys
are entered, although a slight performance degradation may be noticed.
The default value is 1.
.It Fa cachesize
A suggested maximum size, in bytes, of the memory cache.
This value is
.Em only
advisory, and the access method will allocate more memory rather
than fail.
.It Fa hash
.Fa hash
is a user defined hash function.
Since no hash function performs equally well on all possible data, the
user may find that the built-in hash function does poorly on a particular
data set.
User specified hash functions must take two arguments (a pointer to a byte
string and a length) and return a 32-bit quantity to be used as the hash
value.
.It Fa lorder
The byte order for integers in the stored database metadata.
The number should represent the order as an integer; for example,
big endian order would be the number 4,321.
If
.Fa lorder
is 0 (no order is specified) the current host order is used.
If the file already exists, the specified value is ignored and the
value specified when the tree was created is used.
.El
.Pp
If the file already exists (and the
.Dv O_TRUNC
flag is not specified), the
values specified for the parameters bsize, ffactor, lorder and nelem are
ignored and the values specified when the tree was created are used.
.Pp
If a hash function is specified,
.Fa hash_open
will attempt to determine if the hash function specified is the same as
the one with which the database was created, and will fail if it is not.
.Pp
Backward compatible interfaces to the routines described in
.Xr dbm 3 ,
and
.Xr ndbm 3
are provided, although these interfaces are not compatible with
previous file formats.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Nm
access method routines may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library routine
.Xr dbopen 3 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

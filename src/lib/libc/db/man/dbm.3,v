.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dbminit ,
.Nm dbmclose ,
.Nm fetch ,
.Nm store ,
.Nm delete ,
.Nm firstkey ,
.Nm nextkey
.Nd database subroutines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <dbm.h>
.Ft int
.Fn dbminit "const char *file"
.Ft int
.Fn dbmclose "void"
.Ft datum
.Fn fetch "datum key"
.Ft int
.Fn store "datum key" "datum content"
.Ft int
.Fn delete "datum key"
.Ft datum
.Fn firstkey "void"
.Ft datum
.Fn nextkey "datum key"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide a dbm-compatible interface to the
database access methods described in
.Xr db 3 .
Each unique record in the database is a key/content pair,
the components of which may be any arbitrary binary data.
The key and the content data are described by the
.Ft datum
data structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
	char *dptr;
	int dsize;
} datum
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn dbminit
function is used to open a database.
Before the call to
.Fn dbminit ,
the files
.Pa file.pag
and
.Pa file.dir
must exist.
The user is responsible for creating the zero-length
.Pa \&.pag
and
.Pa \&.dir
files.
.Pp
Once the database is open,
.Fn fetch
is used to retrieve the data content associated with the specified
.Fa key .
Similarly,
.Fn store
is used to store the
.Fa content
data with the specified
.Fa key .
.Pp
The
.Fn delete
function removes the specified
.Fa key
and its associated content from the database.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn firstkey
and
.Fn nextkey
are used to iterate over all of the records in the database.
Each record will be reached exactly once, but in no particular order.
The
.Fn firstkey
function returns the first record of the database, and thereafter
.Fn nextkey
returns the following records.
The following code traverses the entire database:
.Bd -literal
  for (key = firstkey(); key.dptr != NULL; key = nextkey(key))
.Ed
.Pp
The behaviour of
.Fn nextkey
is undefined if the database is modified after a call to
.Fn firstkey .
.Pp
The database is closed with the
.Fn dbmclose
function (you must close a database before opening a new one).
.Ss Implementation notes
The underlying database is a
.Xr hash 3
database with a
bucket size of 4096,
a filling factor of 40,
default hashing function and cache size,
and uses the host's native byte order.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, all functions that return
.Ft int
return a value of 0, otherwise a negative value is returned.
.Pp
Functions that return a
.Ft datum
indicate errors by setting the
.Va dptr
field to
.Dv NULL .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr db 3 ,
.Xr hash 3 ,
.Xr ndbm 3
.Sh BUGS
Because the
.Nm dbm
routines are implemented on top of the
.Xr db 3 ,
only a single file,
.Pa file.pag ,
is used to actually store the database.
The references to
.Pa file.dir
are purely for backwards compatibility with historic implementations.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD

official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

1.1.1.4
log
@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any
longer (due to syscall numbering differences); both an OpenBSD compat and
a conversion tool for old MirOS #7 apps will be delivered later.

The src/ tree is locked from now.

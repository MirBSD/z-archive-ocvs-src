#	@@(#)README	8.27 (Berkeley) 9/1/94

This is version 1.85 of the Berkeley DB code.

For information on compiling and installing this software, see the file
PORT/README.

Newer versions of this software will periodically be made available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.  An archive in compressed format
is in ucb/4bsd/db.tar.Z, or in gzip format in ucb/4bsd/db.tar.gz.  If
you'd like to receive announcements of future releases of this software,
send email to the contact address below.

Email questions may be addressed to Keith Bostic at bostic@@cs.berkeley.edu.

============================================
Distribution contents:

Makefile.inc	Ignore this, it's the 4.4BSD subsystem Makefile.
PORT		The per OS/architecture directories to use to build
		libdb.a, if you're not running 4.4BSD.  See the file
		PORT/README for more information.
README		This file.
btree		The B+tree routines.
changelog	List of changes, per version.
db		The dbopen(3) interface routine.
docs		Various USENIX papers, and the formatted manual pages.
hash		The extended linear hashing routines.
man		The unformatted manual pages.
mpool		The memory pool routines.
recno		The fixed/variable length record routines.
test		Test package.

============================================
Debugging:

If you're running a memory checker (e.g. Purify) on DB, make sure that
you recompile it with "-DPURIFY" in the CFLAGS, first.  By default,
allocated pages are not initialized by the DB code, and they will show
up as reads of uninitialized memory in the buffer write routines.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>
# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.Dt INSQUE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm insque ,
.Nm remque
.Nd insert/remove element from a queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <search.h>
.Ft void
.Fn insque "void *elem" "void *pred"
.Ft void
.Fn remque "void *elem"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
These interfaces have been superceded by the
.Xr queue 3
macros and are provided for compatibility with legacy code.
.Ef
.Pp
.Fn insque
and
.Fn remque
manipulate queues built from doubly linked lists.
The queue can be either circular or linear.
Each element in the queue must be of the following form:
.Bd -literal
struct qelem {
    struct qelem   *q_forw;
    struct qelem   *q_back;
    char            q_data[];
};
.Ed
.Pp
The first two elements in the struct must be pointers of the
same type that point to the previous and next elements in
the queue respectively.
Any subsequent data in the struct is application-dependent.
.Pp
The
.Fn insque
function inserts
.Fa elem
into a queue immediately after
.Fa pred .
.Pp
The
.Fn remque
function removes
.Fa elem
from the queue.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
These functions are not atomic unless that machine architecture allows it.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr queue 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn lsearch 
and
.Fn lfind
functions conform to the
.St -p1003.1-01
and 
.St -xpg4.3 .   
specifications.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn insque
and
.Fn remque
functions are derived from the insque and remque instructions on a
.Tn VAX .

@Sync MirBSD main source tree against OpenBSD-current,
which should be fairly stable after the Hackathon now.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

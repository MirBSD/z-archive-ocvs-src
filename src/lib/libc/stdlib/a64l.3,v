.Dt A64L 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm a64l ,
.Nm l64a
.Nd convert between 32-bit integer and radix-64 ASCII string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>
.Ft long
.Fn a64l "const char *s"
.Ft char *
.Fn l64a "long l"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn a64l
and
.Fn l64a
functions are used to maintain numbers stored in radix-64
.Tn ASCII
characters.
This is a notation by which 32-bit integers
can be represented by up to six characters; each character represents a
.Dq digit
in a radix-64 notation.
.Pp
The characters used to represent digits are
.Ql \&.
for 0,
.Ql /
for 1,
.Ql 0
through
.Ql 9
for 2-11,
.Ql A
through
.Ql Z
for 12-37, and
.Ql a
through
.Ql z
for 38-63.
.Pp
The
.Fn a64l
function takes a pointer to a null-terminated radix-64 representation
and returns a corresponding 32-bit value.
If the string pointed to by
.Fa s
contains more than six characters,
.Fn a64l
will use the first six.
.Fn a64l
scans the character string from left to right, decoding
each character as a 6-bit radix-64 number.
If a long integer is
larger than 32 bits, the return value will be sign-extended.
.Pp
.Fn l64a
takes a long integer argument
.Fa l
and returns a pointer to the corresponding radix-64 representation.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success,
.Fn a64l
returns a 32-bit representation of
.Fa s .
If
.Fa s
is a null pointer or if it contains digits other than those described above.
.Fn a64l
returns \-1 and sets the global variable
.Va errno
to
.Er EINVAL .
.Pp
On success,
.Fn l64a
returns a pointer to a string containing the radix-64 representation of
.Fa l .
If
.Fa l
is 0,
.Fn l64a
returns a pointer to the empty string.
If
.Fa l
is negative,
.Fn l64a
returns a null pointer and sets the global variable
.Va errno
to
.Er EINVAL .
.Sh WARNINGS
The value returned by
.Fn l64a
is a pointer into a static buffer, the contents of which
will be overwritten by subsequent calls.
.Pp
The value returned by
.Fn a64l
may be incorrect if the value is too large; for that reason, only strings
that resulted from a call to
.Fn l64a
should be used to call
.Fn a64l .
.Pp
If a long integer is larger than 32 bits, only the low-order
32 bits are used.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn a64l
and
.Fn l64a
functions conform to
.St -xpg4.2 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getsubopt
.Nd get sub options from an argument
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdlib.h>
.Vt extern char *suboptarg;
.Ft int
.Fn getsubopt "char **optionp" "char * const *tokens" "char **valuep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getsubopt
function parses a string containing tokens delimited by one or more
tab, space or comma
.Pq Ql \&,
characters.
It is intended for use in parsing groups of option arguments provided
as part of a utility command line.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa optionp
is a pointer to a pointer to the string.
The argument
.Fa tokens
is a pointer to a null-terminated array of pointers to strings.
.Pp
The
.Fn getsubopt
function returns the zero-based offset of the pointer in the
.Fa tokens
array referencing a string which matches the first token
in the string, or, \-1 if the string contains no tokens or
.Fa tokens
does not contain a matching string.
.Pp
If the token is of the form
.Ar name Ns No = Ns Ar value ,
the location referenced by
.Fa valuep
will be set to point to the start of the
.Dq value
portion of the token.
.Pp
On return from
.Fn getsubopt ,
.Fa optionp
will be set to point to the start of the next token in the string,
or the null at the end of the string if no more tokens are present.
The external variable
.Fa suboptarg
will be set to point to the start of the current token, or
.Dv NULL
if no tokens were present.
The argument
.Fa valuep
will be set to point to the value portion of the token, or
.Dv NULL
if no value portion was present.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -compact
char *tokens[] = {
	#define	ONE	0
		"one",
	#define	TWO	1
		"two",
	NULL
};

\&...

extern char *optarg, *suboptarg;
char *options, *value;

while ((ch = getopt(argc, argv, "ab:")) != \-1) {
	switch(ch) {
	case 'a':
		/* process ``a'' option */
		break;
	case 'b':
		options = optarg;
		while (*options) {
			switch(getsubopt(&options, tokens, &value)) {
			case ONE:
				/* process ``one'' sub option */
				break;
			case TWO:
				/* process ``two'' sub option */
				if (!value)
					error("no value for two");
				i = atoi(value);
				break;
			case \-1:
				if (suboptarg)
					error("illegal sub option %s",
					  suboptarg);
				else
					error("missing sub option");
				break;
		}
		break;

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

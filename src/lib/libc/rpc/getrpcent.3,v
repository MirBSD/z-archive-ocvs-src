.Sh NAME
.Nm getrpcent ,
.Nm getrpcbyname ,

.Nm endrpcent ,
.Nm setrpcent
.Nd get RPC entry
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <netdb.h>
.Ft struct rpcent *
.Fn getrpcent void
.Ft struct rpcent *
.Fn getrpcbyname "char *name"
.Ft struct rpcent *
.Fn getrpcbynumber "int number"

.Fn setrpcent "int stayopen"
.Ft void
.Fn endrpcent void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getrpcent ,
.Fn getrpcbyname ,
and
.Fn getrpcbynumber ,
each return a pointer to an object with the
following structure
containing the broken-out
fields of a line in the rpc program number database,
.Pa /etc/rpc :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct rpcent {
	char	*r_name;	/* name of server for this rpc program */
	char	**r_aliases;	/* alias list */
	long	r_number;	/* rpc program number */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The members of this structure are:
.Bl -tag -width r_aliases -offset indent
.It r_name
The name of the server for this rpc program.
.It r_aliases
A zero terminated list of alternate names for the rpc program.
.It r_number
The rpc program number for this service.
.El
.Pp
.Fn getrpcent
reads the next line of the file, opening the file if necessary.
.Pp
.Fn setrpcent
opens and rewinds the file.
If the
.Fa stayopen
flag is non-zero,
the net database will not be closed after each call to
.Fn getrpcent
(either directly, or indirectly through one of
the other
.Dq getrpc
calls).
.Pp
.Fn endrpcent
closes the file.
.Pp
.Fn getrpcbyname
and
.Fn getrpcbynumber
sequentially search from the beginning
of the file until a matching rpc program name or
program number is found, or until end-of-file is encountered.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/rpc

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A

pointer is returned on
.Dv EOF
or error.
.Sh BUGS
All information
is contained in a static area
so it must be copied if it is

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

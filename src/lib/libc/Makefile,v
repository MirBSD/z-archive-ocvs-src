@it's a bad idea to put the shlib versions into <bsd.own.mk>

@In order to prevent run-time warnings from ld.so,
which complains if a weak symbol isn't resolved,
 * don't use _Jv_RegisterClasses and __cxa_finalize in crtstuff.c
 * refer EH routines from a dummy file within libc,
   so it gets built in (saves us from a major bump,
   and from the need to install libgcc.so)

XXX wouldn't it be better to either add weak definitions,
XXX fix ld or fix ld.so? (but it works!)

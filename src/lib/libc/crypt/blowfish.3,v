.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pa Blowfish
is a fast unpatented block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier.
It basically consists of a 16 times iterated Feistel network.
The block size is 64 bit and the key size is maximal 448 bit.
.Pp
The
.Fn blf_key
function initializes the 4 8bit S-boxes and the 18 Subkeys with
the hexadecimal digits of Pi.
The key is used for further randomization.
The first argument to
.Fn blf_enc
is the initialized state derived from
.Fn blf_key .
The stream of 32-bit words is encrypted in Electronic Codebook
Mode (ECB) and
.Pa datalen
must be even.
.Fn blf_dec
is used for decrypting Blowfish encrypted blocks.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn blf_ecb_encrypt
and
.Fn blf_ecb_decrypt
are used for encrypting and decrypting octet streams in ECB mode.
The functions
.Fn blf_cbc_encrypt
and
.Fn blf_cbc_decrypt
are used for encrypting and decrypting octet streams in
Cipherblock Chaining Mode (CBC).
.Pp
The functions
.Fn Blowfish_initstate ,
.Fn Blowfish_expand0state ,
.Fn Blowfish_expandstate ,
.Fn Blowfish_encipher
and
.Fn Blowfish_decipher
are used for customization of the
.Pa Blowfish
cipher, e.g., for the blowfish password hashing function.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

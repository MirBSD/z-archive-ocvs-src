.Sh DESCRIPTION
The SHA1 functions implement the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1),
FIPS PUB 180-1.
SHA-1 is used to generate a condensed representation
of a message called a message digest.
The algorithm takes a
message less than 2^64 bits as input and produces a 160-bit digest
suitable for use as a digital signature.
.Pp
The SHA1 functions are considered to be more secure than the
.Xr md4 3
and
.Xr md5 3
functions with which they share a similar interface.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1Init
function initializes a SHA1_CTX
.Ar context
for use with
.Fn SHA1Update ,
and
.Fn SHA1Final .
The
.Fn SHA1Update
function adds
.Ar data
of length
.Ar len
to the SHA1_CTX specified by
.Ar context .
.Fn SHA1Final
is called when all data has been added via
.Fn SHA1Update
and stores a message digest in the
.Ar digest
parameter.
When a null pointer is passed to
.Fn SHA1Final
as first argument only the final padding will be applied and the
current context can still be used with
.Fn SHA1Update .
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1Transform
function is used by
.Fn SHA1Update
to hash 512-bit blocks and forms the core of the algorithm.
Most programs should use the interface provided by
.Fn SHA1Init ,
.Fn SHA1Update
and
.Fn SHA1Final
instead of calling
.Fn SHA1Transform
directly.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1End
function is a front end for
.Fn SHA1Final
which converts the digest into an
.Tn ASCII
representation of the 160 bit digest in hexadecimal.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1File
function calculates the digest for a file and returns the result via
.Fn SHA1End .
If
.Fn SHA1File
is unable to open the file a NULL pointer is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1Data
function
calculates the digest of an arbitrary string and returns the result via
.Fn SHA1End .
.Pp
For each of the
.Fn SHA1End ,
.Fn SHA1File ,
and
.Fn SHA1Data
functions the
.Ar buf
parameter should either be a string of at least 41 characters in
size or a NULL pointer.
In the latter case, space will be dynamically allocated via
.Xr malloc 3
and should be freed using
.Xr free 3
when it is no longer needed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The follow code fragment will calculate the digest for
the string "abc" which is ``0xa9993e36476816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d''.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
SHA1_CTX sha;
u_char results[20];
char *buf;
int n;

buf = "abc";
n = strlen(buf);
SHA1Init(&sha);
SHA1Update(&sha, (u_char *)buf, n);
SHA1Final(results, &sha);

/* Print the digest as one long hex value */
printf("0x");
for (n = 0; n < 20; n++)
	printf("%02x", results[n]);
putchar('\en');
.Ed
.Pp
Alternately, the helper functions could be used in the following way:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
SHA1_CTX sha;
u_char output[41];
char *buf = "abc";

printf("0x%s\en", SHA1Data(buf, strlen(buf), output));
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
This implementation of SHA-1 has not been validated by NIST
and as such is not in official compliance with the standard.
.Pp
If a message digest is to be copied to a multi-byte type (ie:
an array of five 32-bit integers) it will be necessary to
perform byte swapping on little endian machines such as the i386, alpha,
and vax.
.Sh AUTHORS
This implementation of SHA-1 was written by Steve Reid.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA1End ,
.Fn SHA1File ,
and
.Fn SHA1Data
helper functions are derived from code written by Poul-Henning Kamp.

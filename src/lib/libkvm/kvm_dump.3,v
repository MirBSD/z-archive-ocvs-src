.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_dump_mkheader ,
.Nm kvm_dump_wrtheader ,
.Nm kvm_dump_inval
.Nd crash-dump support functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <kvm.h>
.Ft int
.Fn kvm_dump_mkheader "kvm_t *kd" "off_t dump_off"
.Ft int
.Fn kvm_dump_wrtheader "kvm_t *kd" "FILE *fp" "int dumpsize"
.Ft int
.Fn kvm_dump_inval "kvm_t *kd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
First note that the functions described here were designed to be used by
.Xr savecore 8 .
.Pp
The function
.Fn kvm_dump_mkheader
checks if the physical memory file associated with
.Fa kd
contains a valid crash-dump header as generated by a dumping kernel.
When a valid header is found,
.Fn kvm_dump_mkheader
initializes the internal kvm data structures as if a crash-dump generated by
the
.Xr savecore 8
program was opened.
This has the intentional side effect of enabling the
address translation machinery.
.Pp
A call to
.Fn kvm_dump_mkheader
will most likely be followed by a call to
.Fn kvm_dump_wrtheader .
This function takes care of generating the generic header, the
.Dv CORE_CPU
section and the section header of the
.Dv CORE_DATA
section.
The data is written to the file pointed at by
.Fa fp .
The
.Fa dumpsize
argument is only used to properly set the segment size of the
.Dv CORE_DATA
section.
Note that this function assumes that
.Fa fp
is positioned at file location 0.
This function will not seek and therefore allows
.Fa fp
to be a file pointer obtained by
.Fn zopen .
.Pp
The
.Fn kvm_dump_inval
function clears the magic number in the physical memory file associated with
.Fa kd .
The address translations must be enabled for this to work (thus assuming
that
.Fn kvm_dump_mkheader
was called earlier in the sequence).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
All functions return 0 on success, \-1 on failure.
In the case of failure,
.Xr kvm_geterr 3
can be used to retrieve the cause of the error.
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in
.Nx 1.1 a.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

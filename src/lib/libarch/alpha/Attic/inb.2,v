.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions in libalpha give userland programs access to the I/O
ports on the OpenBSD/alpha platform. 
.Pp
The 
.Fn in*
functions return data read from the specified I/O port. 
.Pp
The 
.Fn out*
functions write data to the specified I/O port. 
.Pp
.Fn ioperm
enables access to the specified port numbers if 
.Fa on
is 
.Dv TRUE
and disables access if 
.Fa on
is 
.Dv FALSE . 
.Pp 
The 
.Fn map_memory 
function allows a user program to map part of a device memory.
.Pp
The 
.Fn unmap_memory
function unmaps memory that was previously mapped by
.Fn map_memory . 
.Pp
The
.Fn read*
functions read data from device memory previously mapped by
.Fn map_memory . 
.Pp
The 
.Fn write*
functions write data to the device memory previously mapped by
.Fn map_memory .
.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.\" TBW
.Sh HISTORY
These functions originally appeared in
.Fx .
.Sh CAVEATS
Only BWX bus access method is supported for now. Machines requiring
swiz type access are not supported.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

# Copyright © 1968-2003  The authors of And contributors to UNIX®, the

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

as of CTM delta 3496 (roughly 1200 UTC today) into the

@large-scale import of OpenBSD 3.5-current source base including many fixes
note: from now, we will not be binary compatible with OpenBSD apps any

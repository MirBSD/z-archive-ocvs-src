/*
 * If the output file descriptor is connected to a tty (the typical case) it
 * will probably be line-buffered.  Keith Bostic pointed out that we don't want
 * this; it hoses people running over networks by forcing out a bunch of small
 * packets instead of one big one, so screen updates on ptys look jerky.
 * Restore block buffering to prevent this minor lossage.
 *
 * The buffer size is a compromise.  Ideally we'd like a buffer that can hold
 * the maximum possible update size (the whole screen plus cup commands to
 * change lines as it's painted).  On a 66-line xterm this can become
 * excessive.  So we min it with the amount of data we think we can get through
 * two Ethernet packets (maximum packet size - 100 for TCP/IP overhead).
 *
 * Why two ethernet packets?  It used to be one, on the theory that said
 * packets define the maximum size of atomic update.  But that's less than the
 * 2000 chars on a 25 x 80 screen, and we don't want local updates to flicker
 * either.  Two packet lengths will handle up to a 35 x 80 screen.
 *
 * The magic '6' is the estimated length of the end-of-line cup sequence to go
 * to the next line.  It's generous.  We used to mess with the buffering in
 * init_mvcur() after cost computation, but that lost the sequences emitted by
 * init_acs() in setupscreen().
 *
 * "The setvbuf function may be used only after the stream pointed to by stream
 * has been associated with an open file and before any other operation is
 * performed on the stream." (ISO 7.9.5.6.)
 *
 * Grrrr...
 *
 * On a lighter note, many implementations do in fact allow an application to
 * reset the buffering after it has been written to.  We try to do this because
 * otherwise we leave stdout in buffered mode after endwin() is called.  (This
 * also happens with SVr4 curses).
 *
 * There are pros/cons:
 *
 * con:
 *	There is no guarantee that we can reestablish buffering once we've
 *	dropped it.
 *
 *	We _may_ lose data if the implementation does not coordinate this with
 *	fflush.
 *
 * pro:
 *	An implementation is more likely to refuse to change the buffering than
 *	to do it in one of the ways mentioned above.
 *
 *	The alternative is to have the application try to change buffering
 *	itself, which is certainly no improvement.
 *
 * Just in case it does not work well on a particular system, the calls to
 * change buffering are all via the macro NC_BUFFERED.  Some implementations
 * do indeed get confused by changing setbuf on/off, and will overrun the
 * buffer.  So we disable this by default (there may yet be a workaround).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

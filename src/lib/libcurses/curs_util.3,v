.SH NAME
\fBunctrl\fR, \fBkeyname\fR, \fBfilter\fR,
\fBuse_env\fR, \fBputwin\fR, \fBgetwin\fR, \fBdelay_output\fR,
\fBflushinp\fR - miscellaneous \fBcurses\fR utility routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBchar *unctrl(chtype c);\fR
.br
\fBchar *keyname(int c);\fR
.br
\fBvoid filter(void);\fR
.br
\fBvoid use_env(char bool);\fR
.br
\fBint putwin(WINDOW *win, FILE *filep);\fR
.br
\fBWINDOW *getwin(FILE *filep);\fR
.br
\fBint delay_output(int ms);\fR
.br
\fBint flushinp(void);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBunctrl\fR macro expands to a character string which is a printable
representation of the character \fIc\fR.  Control characters are displayed in
the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.  Printing characters are displayed as is.

The \fBkeyname\fR routine returns a character string corresponding to
the key \fIc\fR.

The \fBfilter\fR routine, if used, must be called before \fBinitscr\fR or
\fBnewterm\fR are called.  The effect is that, during those calls, \fBLINES\fR
is set to 1; the capabilities \fBclear\fR, \fBcup\fR, \fBcud\fR, \fBcud1\fR,
\fBcuu1\fR, \fBcuu\fR, \fBvpa\fR are disabled; and the \fBhome\fR string is
set to the value of \fBcr\fR.

The \fBuse_env\fR routine, if used, is called before \fBinitscr\fR or
\fBnewterm\fR are called.  When called with \fBFALSE\fR as an
argument, the values of \fBlines\fR and \fBcolumns\fR specified in the
\fIterminfo\fR database will be used, even if environment variables
\fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR (used by default) are set, or if
\fBcurses\fR is running in a window (in which case default behavior
would be to use the window size if \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR are
not set).

The \fBputwin\fR routine writes all data associated with window \fIwin\fR into
the file to which \fIfilep\fR points.  This information can be later retrieved
using the \fBgetwin\fR function.

The \fBgetwin\fR routine reads window related data stored in the file by
\fBputwin\fR.  The routine then creates and initializes a new window using that
data.  It returns a pointer to the new window.

The \fBdelay_output\fR routine inserts an \fIms\fR millisecond pause
in output.  This routine should not be used extensively because
padding characters are used rather than a CPU pause.

The \fBflushinp\fR routine throws away any typeahead that has been typed by the
user and has not yet been read by the program.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBflushinp\fR, routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR
upon failure and \fBOK\fR (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than
\fBERR\fR") upon successful completion.

\fBflushinp\fR always returns \fBOK\fR.

Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

The SVr4 documentation describes the action of \fBfilter\fR only in the vaguest
terms.  The description here is adapted from the XSI Curses standard (which
erroneously fails to describe the disabling of \fBcuu\fR).
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBunctrl\fR is a macro, which is defined in <\fBunctrl.h\fR>.
.SH SEE ALSO

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

.SH NAME
\fBkeybound\fP \- return definition of keycode
..
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBint keybound(int keycode, int count);\fP
..
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It permits an application to determine the string which is defined
in the terminfo for specific keycodes.
..
.SH RETURN VALUE
The keycode must be greater than zero, else NULL is returned.
If it does not correspond to a defined key, then NULL is returned.
Otherwise, the function returns a string, which must be freed by the caller.
..
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
..
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBdefine_key\fR(3),
\fBkeyok\fR(3).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

### MirBSD is:
# Copyright (c) 1982-2003 by Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser <x86@@ePost.de>

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

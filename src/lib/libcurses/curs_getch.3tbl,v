.SH NAME
\fBgetch\fR,
\fBwgetch\fR,
\fBmvgetch\fR,
\fBmvwgetch\fR,
\fBungetch\fR,
\fBhas_key\fR \- get (or push back) characters from \fBcurses\fR terminal keyboard
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint getch(void);\fR
.br
\fBint wgetch(WINDOW *win);\fR
.br
\fBint mvgetch(int y, int x);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwgetch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);\fR
.br
\fBint ungetch(int ch);\fR
.br
\fBint has_key(int ch);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgetch\fR, \fBwgetch\fR, \fBmvgetch\fR and \fBmvwgetch\fR, routines read
a character from the window.  In no-delay mode, if no input is waiting, the
value \fBERR\fR is returned.  In delay mode, the program waits until the system
passes text through to the program.  Depending on the setting of \fBcbreak\fR,
this is after one character (cbreak mode), or after the first newline (nocbreak
mode).  In half-delay mode, the program waits until a character is typed or the
specified timeout has been reached.

Unless \fBnoecho\fR has been set, then the character will also be echoed into the
designated window according to the following rules:
If the character is the current erase character, left arrow, or backspace,
the cursor is moved one space to the left and that screen position is erased
as if \fBdelch\fR had been called.
If the character value is any other \fBKEY_\fR define, the user is alerted
with a \fBbeep\fR call.
Otherwise the character is simply output to the screen.

If the window is not a pad, and it has been moved or modified since the last
call to \fBwrefresh\fR, \fBwrefresh\fR will be called before another character
is read.

If \fBkeypad\fR is \fBTRUE\fR, and a function key is pressed, the token for
that function key is returned instead of the raw characters.  Possible function
keys are defined in \fB<curses.h>\fR as macros with values outside the range
of 8-bit characters whose names begin with \fBKEY_.\fR Thus, a variable
intended to hold the return value of a function key must be of short size or
larger.

When a character that could be the beginning of a function key is received
(which, on modern terminals, means an escape character), \fBcurses\fR sets a
timer.  If the remainder of the sequence does not come in within the designated
time, the character is passed through; otherwise, the function key value is
returned.  For this reason, many terminals experience a delay between the time
a user presses the escape key and the escape is returned to the program.

The \fBungetch\fR routine places \fIch\fR back onto the input queue to be
returned by the next call to \fBwgetch\fR.  Note that there is, in effect,
just one input queue for all windows.

.SS Function Keys
The following function keys, defined in \fB<curses.h>\fR, might be returned by
\fBgetch\fR if \fBkeypad\fR has been enabled.  Note that not all of these are
necessarily supported on any particular terminal.

.TE
.sp
The \fBhas_key\fR routine takes a key value from the above list, and
returns TRUE or FALSE according as the current terminal type recognizes
a key with that value.

.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an integer value
other than \fBERR\fR (\fBOK\fR in the case of ungetch()) upon successful
completion.
.SH NOTES
Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single character function is
discouraged, as it will cause a delay of up to one second while the
keypad code looks for a following function-key sequence.

Note that some keys may be the same as commonly used control
keys, e.g., KEY_ENTER versus control/M, KEY_BACKSPACE versus control/H.
Some curses implementations may differ according to whether they
treat these control keys specially (and ignore the terminfo), or
use the terminfo definitions.
\fBNcurses\fR uses the terminfo definition.
If it says that KEY_ENTER is control/M, \fBgetch\fR, will return KEY_ENTER
when you press control/M.

When using \fBgetch\fR, \fBwgetch\fR, \fBmvgetch\fR, or
\fBmvwgetch\fR, nocbreak mode (\fBnocbreak\fR) and echo mode
(\fBecho\fR) should not be used at the same time.  Depending on the
state of the tty driver when each character is typed, the program may
produce undesirable results.

Note that \fBgetch\fR, \fBmvgetch\fR, and \fBmvwgetch\fR may be macros.

Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined by the extremely
function-key-rich keyboard of the AT&T 7300, aka 3B1, aka Safari 4.  Modern
personal computers usually have only a small subset of these.  IBM PC-style
consoles typically support little more than \fBKEY_UP\fR, \fBKEY_DOWN\fR,
\fBKEY_LEFT\fR, \fBKEY_RIGHT\fR, \fBKEY_HOME\fR, \fBKEY_END\fR,
\fBKEY_NPAGE\fR, \fBKEY_PPAGE\fR, and function keys 1 through 12.  The Ins key
is usually mapped to \fBKEY_IC\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
The *get* functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  They
read single-byte characters only.  The standard specifies that they return
\fBERR\fR on failure, but specifies no error conditions.

The echo behavior of these functions on input of \fBKEY_\fR or backspace
characters was not specified in the SVr4 documentation.  This description is
adopted from the XSI Curses standard.

The behavior of \fBgetch\fR and friends in the presence of handled signals is
unspecified in the SVr4 and XSI Curses documentation.  Under historical curses
implementations, it varied depending on whether the operating system's
implementation of handled signal receipt interrupts a \fBread\fR(2) call in
progress or not, and also (in some implementations) depending on whether an
input timeout or non-blocking mode hsd been set.

Programmers concerned about portability should be prepared for either of two
cases: (a) signal receipt does not interrupt \fBgetch\fR; (b) signal receipt
interrupts \fBgetch\fR and causes it to return ERR with \fBerrno\fR set to
\fBEINTR\fR.  Under the \fBncurses\fR implementation, handled signals never
interrupt \fBgetch\fR.

The \fBhas_key\fR function is unique to \fBncurses\fR.  We recommend that
any code using it be conditionalized on the \fBNCURSES_VERSION\fR feature macro.

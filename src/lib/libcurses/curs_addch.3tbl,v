.SH NAME
\fBaddch\fR, \fBwaddch\fR, \fBmvaddch\fR, \fBmvwaddch\fR,
\fBechochar\fR,
\fBwechochar\fR - add a character (with attributes) to a \fBcurses\fR window, then advance the cursor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint addch(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint waddch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint mvaddch(int y, int x, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwaddch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint echochar(chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint wechochar(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBaddch\fR, \fBwaddch\fR, \fBmvaddch\fR and \fBmvwaddch\fR routines put
the character \fIch\fR into the given window at its current window position,
which is then advanced.  They are analogous to \fBputchar\fR in \fBstdio\fR(3).
If the advance is at the right margin, the cursor automatically wraps to the
beginning of the next line.  At the bottom of the current scrolling region, if
\fBscrollok\fR is enabled, the scrolling region is scrolled up one line.

If \fIch\fR is a tab, newline, or backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately
within the window.  Backspace moves the cursor one character left; at the left
edge of a window it does nothing.  Newline does a \fBclrtoeol\fR, then moves
the cursor to the window left margin on the next line, scrolling the window if
on the last line).  Tabs are considered to be at every eighth column.

If \fIch\fR is any control character other than tab, newline, or backspace, it
is drawn in \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.  Calling \fBwinch\fR after adding a
control character does not return the character itself, but instead returns
the ^-representation of the control character.

Video attributes can be combined with a character argument passed to
\fBaddch\fR or related functions by logical-ORing them into the character.
(Thus, text, including attributes, can be copied from one place to another
using \fBinch\fR and \fBaddch\fR.).  See the \fBcurs_attr\fR(3) page for
values of predefined video attribute constants that can be usefully OR'ed
into characters.

The \fBechochar\fR and \fBwechochar\fR routines are equivalent to a call to
\fBaddch\fR followed by a call to \fBrefresh\fR, or a call to \fBwaddch\fR
followed by a call to \fBwrefresh\fR.  The knowledge that only a single
character is being output is used and, for non-control characters, a
considerable performance gain may be seen by using these routines instead of
their equivalents.
.SS Line Graphics
The following variables may be used to add line drawing characters to the
screen with routines of the \fBaddch\fR family.  The default character listed
below is used if the \fBacsc\fR capability doesn't define a terminal-specific
replacement for it (but see the EXTENSIONS section below).  The names are
taken from VT100 nomenclature.

.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR on success
(the SVr4 manuals specify only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon
successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine
descriptions.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBaddch\fR, \fBmvaddch\fR, \fBmvwaddch\fR, and
\fBechochar\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
All these functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
The defaults specified for forms-drawing characters apply in the POSIX locale.

Some ACS symbols
(ACS_S3,
ACS_S7,
ACS_LEQUAL,
ACS_GEQUAL,
ACS_PI,
ACS_NEQUAL,
ACS_STERLING)
were not documented in
any publicly released System V.  However, many publicly available terminfos
include \fBacsc\fR strings in which their key characters (pryz{|}) are
embedded, and a second-hand list of their character descriptions has come
to light.  The ACS-prefixed names for them were invented for \fBncurses\fR(3).

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

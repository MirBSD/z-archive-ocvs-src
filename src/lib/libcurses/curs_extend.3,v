.SH NAME
\fBcurs_extend\fR,
\fBcurses_version\fP,
\fBuse_extended_names\fP \- miscellaneous curses extensions
..
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBconst char * curses_version(void);\fP
.br
\fBint use_extended_names(bool enable);\fP
..
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are extensions to the curses library
which do not fit easily into other categories.
.PP
Use
.I curses_version()
to get the version number, including patch level of the library, e.g.,
.B 5.0.19991023
.PP
The
.I use_extended_names()
function controls whether the calling application
is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names
which may be compiled into the terminfo
description, i.e., via the terminfo or termcap interfaces.
Normally these names are available for use, since the essential descision
is made by using the \fB-x\fP option of \fItic\fP to compile
extended terminal definitions.
However you can disable this feature
to ensure compatibility with other implementations of curses
..
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
..

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

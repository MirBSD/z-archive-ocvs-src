.Dd April 4, 1996
.Dt PTHREAD_ONCE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_once
.Nd dynamic package initialization
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Pp
.Ft pthread_once_t
.Fa once_control
\&=
.Dv PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT ;
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_once "pthread_once_t *once_control" "void (*init_routine)(void)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The first call to
.Fn pthread_once
by any thread in a process, with a given
.Fa once_control ,
will call the
.Fn init_routine
with no arguments.
Subsequent calls to
.Fn pthread_once
with the same
.Fa once_control
will not call the
.Fn init_routine .
On return from
.Fn pthread_once ,
it is guaranteed that
.Fn init_routine
has completed.
The
.Fa once_control
parameter is used to determine whether the associated initialization
routine has been called.
.Pp
The function
.Fn pthread_once
is not a cancellation point.
However, if
.Fn init_routine
is a cancellation point and is cancelled, the effect on
.Fa once_control is as if
.Fn pthread_once
was never called.
.Pp
The constant
.Dv PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
is defined by header
.Aq Pa pthread.h .
.Pp
The behavior of
.Fn pthread_once
is undefined if
.Fa once_control
has automatic storage duration or is not initialized by
.Dv PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_once
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
None.
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_once
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

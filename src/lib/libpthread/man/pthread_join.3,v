.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_join
.Nd wait for thread termination
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_join "pthread_t thread" "void **value_ptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_join
function suspends execution of the calling thread until the target
.Fa thread
terminates unless the target
.Fa thread
has already terminated.
.Pp
On return from a successful
.Fn pthread_join
call with a non-NULL
.Fa value_ptr
argument, the value passed to
.Fn pthread_exit
by the terminating thread is stored in the location referenced by
.Fa value_ptr .
When a
.Fn pthread_join
returns successfully, the target thread has been terminated.
The results of multiple simultaneous calls to
.Fn pthread_join
specifying the same target thread are undefined.
If the thread calling
.Fn pthread_join
is cancelled, then the target thread is not detached.
.Pp
A thread that has exited but remains unjoined counts against
[_POSIX_THREAD_THREADS_MAX].
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_join
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_join
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The implementation has detected that the value specified by
.Fa thread
does not refer to a joinable thread.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given
thread ID,
.Fa thread .
.It Bq Er EDEADLK
A deadlock was detected or the value of
.Fa thread
specifies the calling thread.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wait 2 ,
.Xr pthread_create 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_join
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

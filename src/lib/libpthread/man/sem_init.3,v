.Dt SEM_INIT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sem_init
.Nd initialize an unnamed semaphore
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <semaphore.h>
.Ft int
.Fn sem_init "sem_t *sem" "int pshared" "unsigned int value"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sem_init
function initializes the unnamed semaphore pointed to by
.Fa sem
to have the value
.Fa value .
A non-zero value for
.Fa pshared
specifies a shared semaphore that can be used by multiple processes, which this
implementation is not capable of.
.Pp
Following a successful call to
.Fn sem_init ,
.Fa sem
can be used as an argument in subsequent calls to
.Fa sem_wait ,
.Fa sem_trywait ,
.Fa sem_post ,
and
.Fa sem_destroy .
.Fa sem
is no longer valid after a successful call to
.Fa sem_destroy .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std sem_init
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn sem_init
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa value
exceeds SEM_VALUE_MAX.
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
Memory allocation error.
.It Bq Er EPERM
Unable to initialize a shared semaphore.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sem_destroy 3 ,
.Xr sem_post 3 ,
.Xr sem_trywait 3 ,
.Xr sem_wait 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn sem_init
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
.Pp
This implementation does not support shared semaphores, and reports this fact
by setting
.Va errno
to
.Er EPERM .
This is perhaps a stretch of the intention of POSIX, but is
compliant, with the caveat that
.Fn sem_init
always reports a permissions error when an attempt to create a shared semaphore
is made.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

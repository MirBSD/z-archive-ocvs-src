.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_exit
.Nd terminate the calling thread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft void
.Fn pthread_exit "void *value_ptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_exit
function terminates the calling thread and makes the value
.Fa value_ptr
available to any successful join with the terminating thread.
Any
cancellation cleanup handlers that have been pushed and are not yet popped
are popped in the reverse order that they were pushed and then executed.
After all cancellation handlers have been executed, if the thread has any
thread-specific data, appropriate destructor functions are called in an
unspecified order.
Thread termination does not release any application
visible process resources, including, but not limited to, mutexes and
file descriptors, nor does it perform any process level cleanup
actions, including, but not limited to, calling
.Fn atexit
routines that may exist.
.Pp
An implicit call to
.Fn pthread_exit
is made when a thread other than the thread in which
.Fn main
was first invoked returns from the start routine that was used to create
it. The function's return value serves as the thread's exit status.
.Pp
The behavior of
.Fn pthread_exit
is undefined if called from a cancellation handler or destructor function
that was invoked as the result of an implicit or explicit call to
.Fn pthread_exit .
.Pp
After a thread has terminated, the result of access to local (auto)
variables of the thread is undefined.
Thus, references to local variables
of the exiting thread should not be used for the
.Fn pthread_exit
.Fa value_ptr
parameter value.
.Pp
The process will exit with an exit status of 0 after the last thread has
been terminated.
The behavior is as if the implementation called
.Fn exit
with a zero argument at thread termination time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pthread_exit
function cannot return to its caller.
.Sh ERRORS
None.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr _exit 2 ,
.Xr exit 3 ,
.Xr pthread_create 3 ,
.Xr pthread_join 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_exit
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

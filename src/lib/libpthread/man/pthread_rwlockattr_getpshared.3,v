Any thread of any process that has access to the memory where the
read/write lock resides can manipulate the lock.

Only threads created within the same process as the thread that
initialized the read/write lock can manipulate the lock.
This is the default value.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_cond_timedwait
.Nd "wait on a condition variable for a specific amount of time"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait "pthread_cond_t *cond" "pthread_mutex_t *mutex" "const struct timespec *abstime"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
function atomically blocks the current thread waiting on the condition
variable specified by
.Fa cond ,
and unblocks the mutex specified by
.Fa mutex .
The waiting thread unblocks only after another thread calls
.Xr pthread_cond_signal 3 ,
or
.Xr pthread_cond_broadcast 3
with the same condition variable, or if the system time reaches the
time specified in
.Fa abstime ,
and the current thread reacquires the lock on
.Fa mutex .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value specified by
.Fa cond ,
.Fa mutex
or
.Fa abstime
is invalid.
.It Bq Er ETIMEDOUT
The system time has reached or exceeded the time specified in
.Fa abstime .

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pthread_cond_broadcast 3 ,
.Xr pthread_cond_destroy 3 ,
.Xr pthread_cond_init 3 ,
.Xr pthread_cond_signal 3 ,
.Xr pthread_cond_wait 3

conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

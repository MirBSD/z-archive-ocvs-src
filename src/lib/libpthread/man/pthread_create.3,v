.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_create
.Nd create a new thread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_create "pthread_t *thread" "const pthread_attr_t *attr" "void *(*start_routine)(void *)" "void *arg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_create
function is used to create a new thread, with attributes specified by
.Fa attr ,
within a process.
If
.Fa attr
is NULL, the default attributes are used. If the attributes specified by
.Fa attr
are modified later, the thread's attributes are not affected.
Upon successful completion
.Fn pthread_create
will store the ID of the created thread in the location specified by
.Fa thread .
.Pp
The thread is created executing
.Fa start_routine
with
.Fa arg
as its sole argument.
If the
.Fa start_routine
returns, the effect is as if there was an implicit call to
.Fn pthread_exit
using the return value of
.Fa start_routine
as the exit status.
Note that the thread in which
.Fn main
was originally invoked differs from this.
When it returns from
.Fn main ,
the effect is as if there was an implicit call to
.Fn exit
using the return value of
.Fn main
as the exit status.
.Pp
The signal state of the new thread is initialized as:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
The signal mask is inherited from the creating thread.
.It
The set of signals pending for the new thread is empty.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_create
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_create
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The system lacked the necessary resources to create another thread, or
the system-imposed limit on the total number of threads in a process
[PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX] would be exceeded.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value specified by
.Fa attr
is invalid.
.El

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

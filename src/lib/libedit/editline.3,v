.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides generic line editing and history functions,
similar to those found in
.Xr sh 1 .
.Pp
These functions are available in the
.Nm libedit
library (which needs the
.Nm libcurses
library).
Programs should be linked with
.Fl ledit lcurses .
.Sh LINE EDITING FUNCTIONS
The line editing functions use a common data structure,
.Fa EditLine ,
which is created by
.Fn el_init
and freed by
.Fn el_end .
.Pp
The following functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn el_init
Initialise the line editor, and return a data structure
to be used by all other line editing functions.
.Fa prog
is the name of the invoking program, used when reading the
.Xr editrc 5
file to determine which settings to use.
.Fa fin ,
.Fa fout
and
.Fa ferr
are the input, output, and error streams (respectively) to use.
In this documentation, references to
.Dq the tty
are actually to this input/output stream combination.
.It Fn el_end
Clean up and finish with
.Fa e ,
assumed to have been created with
.Fn el_init .
.It Fn el_reset
Reset the tty and the parser.
This should be called after an error which may have upset the tty's
state.
.It Fn el_gets
Read a line from the tty.
.Fa count
is modified to contain the number of characters read.
Returns the line read if successful, or
.Dv NULL
if no characters were read or if an error occurred.
.It Fn el_getc
Read a character from the tty.
.Fa ch
is modified to contain the character read.
Returns the number of characters read if successful, \-1 otherwise.
.It Fn el_push
Pushes
.Fa str
back onto the input stream.
This is used by the macro expansion mechanism.
Refer to the description of
.Ic bind
.Fl s
in
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Fn el_parse
Parses the
.Fa argv
array (which is
.Fa argc
elements in size)
to execute builtin
.Nm
commands.
If the command is prefixed with
.Dq prog :
then
.Fn el_parse
will only execute the command if
.Dq prog
matches the
.Fa prog
argument supplied to
.Fn el_init .
The return value is
\-1 if the command is unknown,
0 if there was no error or
.Dq prog
didn't match, or
1 if the command returned an error.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Fn el_set
Set
.Nm
parameters.
.Fa op
determines which parameter to set, and each operation has its
own parameter list.
.Pp
The following values for
.Fa op
are supported, along with the required argument list:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv EL_PROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Define prompt printing function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return a string that contains the prompt.

reading command input:
.Dv SIGCONT ,
.Dv SIGHUP ,
.Dv SIGINT ,
.Dv SIGQUIT ,
.Dv SIGSTOP ,
.Dv SIGTERM ,
.Dv SIGTSTP ,

.Fn func ,
referred to as
.Fa name
which is invoked when a key which is bound to
.Fa name
is entered.
.Fa help
is a description of
.Fa name .
At invocation time,
.Fa ch
is the key which caused the invocation.
The return value of
.Fn func
should be one of:
.Bl -tag -width "CC_REDISPLAY"
.It Dv CC_NORM

.Xc
Defines which history function to use, which is usually
.Fn history .
.Fa ptr
should be the value returned by
.Fn history_init .
.It Dv EL_EDITMODE , Fa "int flag"
If
.Fa flag
is non-zero,
editing is enabled (the default).
Note that this is only an indication, and does not
affect the operation of
.Nm .
At this time, it is the caller's responsibility to
check this
(using
.Fn el_get )
to determine if editing should be enabled or not.
.It Dv EL_GETCFN , Fa "int (*f)(EditLine *, char *c)"
Define the character reading function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return the number of characters read and store them in
.Fa c .
This function is called internally by
.Fn el_gets
and
.Fn el_getc .
The builtin function can be set or restored with the special function
name ``EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN''.
.It Dv EL_CLIENTDATA , Fa "void *data"
Register
.Fa data
to be associated with this EditLine structure.
It can be retrieved with the corresponding

Return non-zero if
.Nm
has installed private signal handlers (see
.Fn el_get
above).
.It Dv EL_EDITMODE, Fa "int *"
Return non-zero if editing is enabled.
.It Dv EL_GETCFN, Fa "int (**f)(EditLine *, char *)"
Return a pointer to the function that read characters, which is equal to
``EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN'' in the case of the default builtin function.

try
.Pa $PWD/.editrc
then
.Pa $HOME/.etc/editrc .
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for details on the format of
.Fa file .
.It Fn el_resize
Must be called if the terminal size changes.
If
.Dv EL_SIGNAL
has been set with
.Fn el_set ,
then this is done automatically.
Otherwise, it's the responsibility of the application to call
.Fn el_resize
on the appropriate occasions.
.It Fn el_line
Return the editing information for the current line in a
.Fa LineInfo
structure, which is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct lineinfo {
    const char *buffer;    /* address of buffer */
    const char *cursor;    /* address of cursor */
    const char *lastchar;  /* address of last character */
} LineInfo;
.Ed

.Fa str
into the line at the cursor.
Returns \-1 if
.Fa str
is empty or won't fit, and 0 otherwise.
.It Fn el_deletestr
Delete
.Fa num
characters before the cursor.
.El
.Sh HISTORY LIST FUNCTIONS

If
.Dv H_SETUNIQUE
has been called with a non-zero argument, the element
will not be entered into the history if its contents match
the ones of the current history element.
If the element is entered

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

.It Dv EL_GETCFN , Fa "int (*f)(EditLine *, char *c)"
Define the character reading function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return the number of characters read and store them in
.Fa c .
This function is called internally by
.Fn el_gets
and
.Fn el_getc .
The builtin function can be set or restored with the special function
name ``EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN''.

The following values for
.Fa op
are supported, along with actual type of
.Fa result :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv EL_PROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Return a pointer to the function that displays the prompt.
.It Dv EL_RPROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Return a pointer to the function that displays the rightside prompt.
.It Dv EL_EDITOR , Fa "const char *"
Return the name of the editor, which will be one of
.Dq emacs
or
.Dq vi .
.It Dv EL_SIGNAL , Fa "int *"
Return non-zero if
.Nm
has installed private signal handlers (see
.Fn el_get
above).
.It Dv EL_EDITMODE, Fa "int *"
Return non-zero if editing is enabled.
.It Dv EL_GETCFN, Fa "int (**f)(EditLine *, char *)"
Return a pointer to the function that read characters, which is equal to
``EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN'' in the case of the default builtin function.
.It Dv EL_CLIENTDATA , Fa "void **data"
Retrieve
.Fa data
previously registered with the corresponding
.Fn el_set
call.
.It Dv EL_UNBUFFERED, Fa "int"
Sets or clears unbuffered mode.
In this mode,

/*
 *  SYSEXITS.H -- Exit status codes for system programs.
 *
 *	This include file attempts to categorize possible error
 *	exit statuses for system programs, notably delivermail
 *	and the Berkeley network.
 *
 *	Error numbers begin at EX__BASE to reduce the possibility of
 *	clashing with other exit statuses that random programs may
 *	already return.  The meaning of the codes is approximately
 *	as follows:
 *
 *	EX_USAGE -- The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with
 *		the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad
 *		syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
 *	EX_DATAERR -- The input data was incorrect in some way.
 *		This should only be used for user's data & not
 *		system files.
 *	EX_NOINPUT -- An input file (not a system file) did not
 *		exist or was not readable.  This could also include
 *		errors like "No message" to a mailer (if it cared
 *		to catch it).
 *	EX_NOUSER -- The user specified did not exist.  This might
 *		be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
 *	EX_NOHOST -- The host specified did not exist.  This is used
 *		in mail addresses or network requests.
 *	EX_UNAVAILABLE -- A service is unavailable.  This can occur
 *		if a support program or file does not exist.  This
 *		can also be used as a catchall message when something
 *		you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know
 *		why.
 *	EX_SOFTWARE -- An internal software error has been detected.
 *		This should be limited to non-operating system related
 *		errors as possible.
 *	EX_OSERR -- An operating system error has been detected.
 *		This is intended to be used for such things as "cannot
 *		fork", "cannot create pipe", or the like.  It includes
 *		things like getuid returning a user that does not
 *		exist in the passwd file.
 *	EX_OSFILE -- Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /var/run/utmp,
 *		etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
 *		sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
 *	EX_CANTCREAT -- A (user specified) output file cannot be
 *		created.
 *	EX_IOERR -- An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
 *	EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
 *		is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
 *		that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
 *		and the request should be reattempted later.
 *	EX_PROTOCOL -- the remote system returned something that
 *		was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
 *	EX_NOPERM -- You did not have sufficient permission to
 *		perform the operation.  This is not intended for
 *		file system problems, which should use EX_NOINPUT or
 *		EX_CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.
 *	EX_CONFIG -- Something was found in an unconfigured or
 *		misconfigured state.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.

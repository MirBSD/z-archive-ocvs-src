 * This describes the protocol used by the talk server and clients.
 *
 * The talk server acts a repository of invitations, responding to
 * requests by clients wishing to rendezvous for the purpose of
 * holding a conversation.  In normal operation, a client, the caller,
 * initiates a rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of
 * type LOOK_UP.  This causes the server to search its invitation
 * tables to check if an invitation currently exists for the caller
 * (to speak to the callee specified in the message).  If the lookup
 * fails, the caller then sends an ANNOUNCE message causing the server
 * to broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports requesting
 * contact.  When the callee responds, the local server uses the
 * recorded invitation to respond with the appropriate rendezvous
 * address and the caller and callee client programs establish a
 * stream connection through which the conversation takes place.

@Import OpenBSD 3.3 source repository from CTM 3132 the first time
This opens an OpenBSD-mirabile (aka MirBSD) repository.

MirBSD is my private tree. MirBSD does not differ very much from OpenBSD
and intentionally tracks OpenBSD. That's why it _is_ OpenBSD, just not the
official one. It's like with DarrenBSD.

At time of this writing, no advertising for MirBSD must be done,
because the advertising clause has not yet been sorted out.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import latest OpenBSD CVS tree by CTM in order
to sync the base system and ports tree with Them.

This includes the recent licence changes as well - by
importing the changed base and re-applying the diffs
(with cvs up -j -j) they are inherited, and we're not
bound to the removed clauses any longer.
